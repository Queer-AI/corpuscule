ACT ONE

Scene One

Low bright sun. Veranda. Flagpole with Union Flag. The family – CLIVE, BETTY, EDWARD, VICTORIA, MAUD, ELLEN, JOSHUA.

ALL (sing)

Come gather, sons of England, come gather in your pride.



Now meet the world united, now face it side by side;



Ye who the earth’s wide corners, from veldt to prairie, roam.



From bush and jungle muster all who call old England ‘home’.



Then gather round for England,



Rally to the flag,



From north and south and east and west



Come one and all for England!



CLIVE

This is my family. Though far from home



We serve the Queen wherever we may roam.



I am a father to the natives here,



And father to my family so dear.



He presents BETTY. She is played by a man.



My wife is all I dreamt a wife should be,



And everything she is she owes to me.



BETTY

I live for Clive. The whole aim of my life



Is to be what he looks for in a wife.



I am a man’s creation as you see,



And what men want is what I want to be.



CLIVE presents JOSHUA. He is played by a white.



CLIVE

My boy’s a jewel. Really has the knack.



You’d hardly notice that the fellow’s black.



JOSHUA

My skin is black but oh my soul is white.



I hate my tribe. My master is my light.



I only live for him. As you can see,



What white men want is what I want to be.



CLIVE presents EDWARD. He is played by a woman.



CLIVE

My son is young. I’m doing all I can



To teach him to grow up to be a man.



EDWARD

What father wants I’d dearly like to be.



I find it rather hard as you can see.



CLIVE presents VICTORIA, who is a dummy,



MAUD, and ELLEN.



CLIVE

No need for any speeches by the rest.



My daughter, mother-in-law, and governess.



ALL (sing)

O’er countless numbers she, our Queen,



Victoria reigns supreme;



O’er Africa’s sunny plains, and o’er



Canadian frozen stream;



The forge of war shall weld the chains of brotherhood secure;



So to all time in ev’ry clime our Empire shall endure.



Then gather round for England,



Rally to the flag,



From north and south and east and west



Come one and all for England!



All go except BETTY. CLIVE comes.



BETTY

Clive?



CLIVE

Betty. Joshua!



JOSHUA comes with a drink for CLIVE.



BETTY

I thought you would never come. The day’s so long without you.



CLIVE

Long ride in the bush.



BETTY

Is anything wrong? I heard drums.



CLIVE

Nothing serious. Beauty is a damned good mare. I must get some new boots sent from home. These ones have never been right. I have a blister.



BETTY

My poor dear foot.



CLIVE

It’s nothing.



BETTY

Oh but it’s sore.



CLIVE

We are not in this country to enjoy ourselves. Must have ridden fifty miles. Spoke to three different headmen who would all gladly chop off each other’s heads and wear them round their waists.



BETTY

Clive!



CLIVE

Don’t be squeamish, Betty, let me have my joke.



And what has my little dove done today?



BETTY

I’ve read a little.



CLIVE

Good. Is it good?



BETTY

It’s poetry.



CLIVE

You’re so delicate and sensitive.



BETTY

And I played the piano. Shall I send for the children?



CLIVE

Yes, in a minute. I’ve a piece of news for you.



BETTY

Good news?



CLIVE

You’ll certainly think it’s good. A visitor.



BETTY

From home?



CLIVE

No. Well of course originally from home.



BETTY

Man or woman?



CLIVE

Man.



BETTY

I can’t imagine.



CLIVE

Something of an explorer. Bit of a poet. Odd chap but brave as a lion. And a great admirer of yours.



BETTY

What do you mean? Whoever can it be?



CLIVE

With an H and a B. And does conjuring tricks for little Edward.



BETTY

That sounds like Mr Bagley.



CLIVE

Harry Bagley.



BETTY

He certainly doesn’t admire me, Clive, what a thing to say. How could I possibly guess from that. He’s hardly explored anything at all, he’s just been up a river, he’s done nothing at all compared to what you do. You should have said a heavy drinker and a bit of a bore.



CLIVE

But you like him well enough. You don’t mind him coming?



BETTY

Anyone at all to break the monotony.



CLIVE

But you have your mother. You have Ellen.



BETTY

Ellen is a governess. My mother is my mother.



CLIVE

I hoped when she came to visit she would be company for you.



BETTY

I don’t think mother is on a visit. I think she lives with us.



CLIVE

I think she does.



BETTY

Clive you are so good.



CLIVE

But are you bored my love?



BETTY

It’s just that I miss you when you’re away. We’re not in this country to enjoy ourselves. If I lack society that is my form of service.



CLIVE

That’s a brave girl. So today has been, all right? No fainting? No hysteria?



BETTY

I have been very tranquil.



CLIVE

Ah what a haven of peace to come home to. The cool, the calm, the beauty.



BETTY

There is one thing, Clive, if you don’t mind.



CLIVE

What can I do for you, my dear?



BETTY

It’s about Joshua.



CLIVE

I wouldn’t leave you alone here with a quiet mind if it weren’t for Joshua.



BETTY

Joshua doesn’t like me.



CLIVE

Joshua has been my boy for eight years. He has saved my life. I have saved his life. He is devoted to me and to mine. I have said this before.



BETTY

He is rude to me. He doesn’t do what I say. Speak to him.



CLIVE

Tell me what happened.



BETTY

He said something improper.



CLIVE

Well, what?



BETTY

I don’t like to repeat it.



CLIVE

I must insist.



BETTY

I had left my book inside on the piano. I was in the hammock. I asked him to fetch it.



CLIVE

And did he not fetch it?



BETTY

Yes, he did eventually.



CLIVE

And what did he say?



BETTY

Clive –



CLIVE

Betty.



BETTY

He said Fetch it yourself. You’ve got legs under that dress.



CLIVE

Joshua!



JOSHUA comes.



Joshua, madam says you spoke impolitely to her this afternoon.



JOSHUA

Sir?



CLIVE

When she asked you to pass her book from the piano.



JOSHUA

She has the book, sir.



BETTY

I have the book now, but when I told you –



CLIVE

Betty, please, let me handle this. You didn’t pass it at once?



JOSHUA

No sir, I made a joke first.



CLIVE

What was that?



JOSHUA

I said my legs were tired, sir. That was funny because the book was very near, it would not make my legs tired to get it.



BETTY

That’s not true.



JOSHUA

Did madam hear me wrong?



CLIVE

She heard something else.



JOSHUA

What was that, madam?



BETTY

Never mind.



CLIVE

Now Joshua, it won’t do you know. Madam doesn’t like that kind of joke. You must do what madam says, just do what she says and don’t answer back. You know your place, Joshua. I don’t have to say any more.



JOSHUA

No sir.



BETTY

I expect an apology.



JOSHUA

I apologise, madam.



CLIVE

There now. It won’t happen again, my dear. I’m very shocked Joshua, very shocked.



CLIVE winks at JOSHUA, unseen by BETTY. JOSHUA goes.



CLIVE

I think another drink, and send for the children, and isn’t that Harry riding down the hill? Wave, wave. Just in time before dark. Cuts it fine, the blighter. Always a hothead, Harry.



BETTY

Can he see us?



CLIVE

Stand further forward. He’ll see your white dress. There, he waved back.



BETTY

Do you think so? I wonder what he saw. Sometimes sunset is so terrifying I can’t bear to look.



CLIVE

It makes me proud. Elsewhere in the empire the sun is rising.



BETTY

Harry looks so small on the hillside.



ELLEN comes.



ELLEN

Shall I bring the children?



BETTY

Shall Ellen bring the children?



CLIVE

Delightful.



BETTY

Yes, Ellen, make sure they’re warm. The night air is deceptive. Victoria was looking pale yesterday.



CLIVE

My love.



MAUD comes from inside the house.



MAUD

Are you warm enough Betty?



BETTY

Perfectly.



MAUD

The night air is deceptive.



BETTY

I’m quite warm. I’m too warm.



MAUD

You’re not getting a fever, I hope? She’s not strong, you know, Clive. I don’t know how long you’ll keep her in this climate.



CLIVE

I look after Her Majesty’s domains. I think you can trust me to look after my wife.



ELLEN comes carrying VICTORIA, aged 2. EDWARD, aged 9, lags behind.



BETTY

Victoria, my pet, say good evening to Papa.



CLIVE takes VICTORIA on his knee.



CLIVE

There’s my sweet little Vicky. What have we done today?



BETTY

She wore Ellen’s hat.



CLIVE

Did she wear Ellen’s big hat like a lady. What a pretty.



BETTY

And Joshua gave her a piggy back. Tell Papa. Horsey with Joshy?



ELLEN

She’s tired.



CLIVE

Nice Joshy played horsey. What a big strong Joshy. Did you have a gallop? Did you make him stop and go? Not very chatty tonight are we?



BETTY

Edward, say good evening to papa.



CLIVE

Edward my boy. Have you done your lessons well?



EDWARD

Yes papa.



CLIVE

Did you go riding?



EDWARD

Yes papa.



CLIVE

What’s that you’re holding?



BETTY

It’s Victoria’s doll. What are you doing with it, Edward?



EDWARD

Minding her.



BETTY

Well I should give it to Ellen quickly. You don’t want papa to see you with a doll.



CLIVE

No, we had you with Victoria’s doll once before, Edward.



ELLEN

He’s minding it for Vicky. He’s not playing with it.



BETTY

He’s not playing with it, Clive. He’s minding it for Vicky.



CLIVE

Ellen minds Victoria, let Ellen mind the doll.



ELLEN

Come, give it to me.



ELLEN takes the doll.



EDWARD

Don’t pull her about. Vicky’s very fond of her. She likes me to have her.



BETTY

He’s a very good brother.



CLIVE

Yes, it’s manly of you Edward, to take care of your little sister. We’ll say no more about it. Tomorrow I’ll take you riding with me and Harry Bagley. Would you like that?



EDWARD

Is he here?



CLIVE

He’s just arrived. There Betty, take Victoria now. I must go and welcome Harry.



CLIVE tosses VICTORIA to BETTY, who gives her to ELLEN.



EDWARD

Can I come, papa?



BETTY

Is he warm enough?



EDWARD

Am I warm enough?



CLIVE

Never mind the women, Ned. Come and meet Harry.



They go. The women are left. There is a silence.



MAUD

I daresay Mr Bagley will be out all day and we’ll see nothing of him.



BETTY

He plays the piano. Surely he will sometimes stay at home with us.



MAUD

We can’t expect it. The men have their duties and we have ours.



BETTY

He won’t have seen a piano for a year. He lives a very rough life.



ELLEN

Will it be exciting for you, Betty?



MAUD

Whatever do you mean, Ellen?



ELLEN

We don’t have very much society.



BETTY

Clive is my society.



MAUD

It’s time Victoria went to bed.



ELLEN

She’d like to stay up and see Mr Bagley.



MAUD

Mr Bagley can see her tomorrow.



ELLEN goes.



MAUD

You let that girl forget her place, Betty.



BETTY

Mother, she is governess to my son. I know what her place is. I think my friendship does her good. She is not very happy.



MAUD

Young women are never happy.



BETTY

Mother, what a thing to say.



MAUD

Then when they’re older they look back and see that comparatively speaking they were ecstatic.



BETTY

I’m perfectly happy.



MAUD

You are looking very pretty tonight. You were such a success as a young girl. You have made a most fortunate marriage. I’m sure you will be an excellent hostess to Mr Bagley.



BETTY

I feel quite nervous at the thought of entertaining.



MAUD

I can always advise you if I’m asked.



BETTY

What a long time they’re taking. I always seem to be waiting for the men.



MAUD

Betty you have to learn to be patient. I am patient. My mama was very patient.



CLIVE approaches, supporting MRS SAUNDERS.



CLIVE

It is a pleasure. It is an honour. It is positively your duty to seek my help. I would be hurt, I would be insulted by any show of independence. Your husband would have been one of my dearest friends if he had lived. Betty, look who has come, Mrs Saunders. She has ridden here all alone, amazing spirit. What will you have? Tea or something stronger? Let her lie down, she is overcome. Betty, you will know what to do.



MRS SAUNDERS lies down.



MAUD

I knew it. I heard drums. We’ll be killed in our beds.



CLIVE

Now, please, calm yourself.



MAUD

I am perfectly calm. I am just outspoken. If it comes to being killed I shall take it as calmly as anyone.



CLIVE

There is no cause for alarm. Mrs Saunders has been alone since her husband died last year, amazing spirit. Not surprisingly, the strain has told. She has come to us as her nearest neighbours.



MAUD

What happened to make her come?



CLIVE

This is not an easy country for a woman.



MAUD

Clive, I heard drums. We are not children.



CLIVE

Of course you heard drums. The tribes are constantly at war, if the term is not too grand to grace their squabbles. Not unnaturally Mrs Saunders would like the company of white women. The piano. Poetry.



BETTY

We are not her nearest neighbours.



CLIVE

We are among her nearest neighbours and I was a dear friend of her late husband. She knows that she will find a welcome here. She will not be disappointed. She will be cared for.



MAUD

Of course we will care for her.



BETTY

Victoria is in bed. I must go and say goodnight. Mother, please, you look after Mrs Saunders.



CLIVE

Harry will be here at once.



BETTY goes.



MAUD

How rash to go out after dark without a shawl.



CLIVE

Amazing spirit. Drink this.



MRS SAUNDERS

Where am I?



MAUD

You are quite safe.



MRS SAUNDERS

Clive? Clive? Thank God. This is very kind. How do you do? I am sorry to be a nuisance. Charmed. Have you a gun? I have a gun.



CLIVE

There is no need for guns I hope. We are all friends here.



MRS SAUNDERS

I think I will lie down again.



HARRY BAGLEY and EDWARD have approached.



MAUD

Ah, here is Mr Bagley.



EDWARD

I gave his horse some water.



CLIVE

You don’t know Mrs Saunders, do you Harry? She has at present collapsed, but she is recovering thanks to the good offices of my wife’s mother who I think you’ve met before. Betty will be along in a minute. Edward will go home to school shortly. He is quite a young man since you saw him.



HARRY

I hardly knew him.



MAUD

What news have you for us, Mr Bagley?



CLIVE

Do you know Mrs Saunders, Harry? Amazing spirit.



EDWARD

Did you hardly know me?



HARRY

Of course I knew you. I mean you have grown.



EDWARD

What do you expect?



HARRY

That’s quite right, people don’t get smaller.



MAUD

Edward. You should be in bed.



EDWARD

No, I’m not tired, I’m not tired am I Uncle Harry?



HARRY

I don’t think he’s tired.



CLIVE

He is overtired. It is past his bedtime. Say goodnight.



EDWARD

Goodnight, sir.



CLIVE

And to your grandmother.



EDWARD

Goodnight, Grandmother.



EDWARD goes.



MAUD

Shall I help Mrs Saunders indoors? I’m afraid she may get a chill.



CLIVE

Shall I give her an arm?



MAUD

How kind of you Clive. I think I am strong enough.



MAUD helps MRS SAUNDERS into the house.



CLIVE

Not a word to alarm the women.



HARRY

Absolutely.



CLIVE

I did some good today I think. Kept up some alliances. There’s a lot of affection there.



HARRY

They’re affectionate people. They can be very cruel of course.



CLIVE

Well they are savages.



HARRY

Very beautiful people many of them.



CLIVE

Joshua! (To HARRY.) I think we should sleep with guns.



HARRY

I haven’t slept in a house for six months. It seems extremely safe.



JOSHUA comes.



CLIVE

Joshua, you will have gathered there’s a spot of bother. Rumours of this and that. You should be armed I think.



JOSHUA

There are many bad men, sir. I pray about it. Jesus will protect us.



CLIVE

He will indeed and I’ll also get you a weapon. Betty, come and keep Harry company. Look in the barn, Joshua, every night.



CLIVE and JOSHUA go. BETTY comes.



HARRY

I wondered where you were.



BETTY

I was singing lullabies.



HARRY

When I think of you I always think of you with Edward in your lap.



BETTY

Do you think of me sometimes then?



HARRY

You have been thought of where no white woman has ever been thought of before.



BETTY

It’s one way of having adventures. I suppose I will never go in person.



HARRY

That’s up to you.



BETTY

Of course it’s not. I have duties.



HARRY

Are you happy, Betty?



BETTY

Where have you been?



HARRY

Built a raft and went up the river. Stayed with some people. The king is always very good to me. They have a lot of skulls around the place but not white men’s I think. I made up a poem one night. If I should die in this forsaken spot, There is a loving heart without a blot, Where I will live – and so on.



BETTY

When I’m near you it’s like going out into the jungle. It’s like going up the river on a raft. It’s like going out in the dark.



HARRY

And you are safety and light and peace and home.



BETTY

But I want to be dangerous.



HARRY

Clive is my friend.



BETTY

I am your friend.



HARRY

I don’t like dangerous women.



BETTY

Is Mrs Saunders dangerous?



HARRY

Not to me. She’s a bit of an old boot.



JOSHUA comes, unobserved.



BETTY

Am I dangerous?



HARRY

You are rather.



BETTY

Please like me.



HARRY

I worship you.



BETTY

Please want me.



HARRY

I don’t want to want you. Of course I want you.



BETTY

What are we going to do?



HARRY

I should have stayed on the river. The hell with it.



He goes to take her in his arms, she runs away into the house. HARRY stays where he is. He becomes aware of JOSHUA.



HARRY

Who’s there?



JOSHUA

Only me sir.



HARRY

Got a gun now have you?



JOSHUA

Yes sir.



HARRY

Where’s Clive?



JOSHUA

Going round the boundaries sir.



HARRY

Have you checked there’s nobody in the barns?



JOSHUA

Yes sir.



HARRY

Shall we go in a barn and fuck? It’s not an order.



JOSHUA

That’s all right, yes.



They go off.




Scene Two

An open space some distance from the house. MRS SAUNDERS alone, breathless. She is carrying a riding crop. CLIVE arrives.

CLIVE

Why? Why?



MRS SAUNDERS

Don’t fuss, Clive, it makes you sweat.



CLIVE

Why ride off now? Sweat, you would sweat if you were in love with somebody as disgustingly capricious as you are. You will be shot with poisoned arrows. You will miss the picnic. Somebody will notice I came after you.



MRS SAUNDERS

I didn’t want you to come after me. I wanted to be alone.



CLIVE

You will be raped by cannibals.



MRS SAUNDERS

I just wanted to get out of your house.



CLIVE

My God, what women put us through. Cruel, cruel. I think you are the sort of woman who would enjoy whipping somebody. I’ve never met one before.



MRS SAUNDERS

Can I tell you something, Clive?



CLIVE

Let me tell you something first. Since you came to the house I have had an erection twenty-four hours a day except for ten minutes after the time we had intercourse.



MRS SAUNDERS

I don’t think that’s physically possible.



CLIVE

You are causing me appalling physical suffering. Is this the way to treat a benefactor?



MRS SAUNDERS

Clive, when I came to your house the other night I came because I was afraid. The cook was going to let his whole tribe in through the window.



CLIVE

I know that, my poor sweet. Amazing –



MRS SAUNDERS

I came to you although you are not my nearest neighbour –



CLIVE

Rather than to the old major of seventy-two.



MRS SAUNDERS

Because the last time he came to visit me I had to defend myself with a shotgun and I thought you would take no for an answer.



CLIVE

But you’ve already answered yes.



MRS SAUNDERS

I answered yes once. Sometimes I want to say no.



CLIVE

Women, my God. Look the picnic will start, I have to go to the picnic. Please Caroline –



MRS SAUNDERS

I think I will have to go back to my own house.



CLIVE

Caroline, if you were shot with poisoned arrows do you know what I’d do? I’d fuck your dead body and poison myself. Caroline, you smell amazing. You terrify me. You are dark like this continent. Mysterious. Treacherous. When you rode to me through the night. When you fainted in my arms. When I came to you in your bed, when I lifted the mosquito netting, when I said let me in, let me in. Oh don’t shut me out, Caroline, let me in.



He has been caressing her feet and legs. He disappears completely under her skirt.



MRS SAUNDERS

Please stop. I can’t concentrate. I want to go home. I wish I didn’t enjoy the sensation because I don’t like you, Clive. I do like living in your house where there’s plenty of guns. But I don’t like you at all. But I do like the sensation. Well I’ll have it then. I’ll have it, I’ll have it – Voices are heard singing ‘The First Noel’.



Don’t stop. Don’t stop.



CLIVE comes out from under her skirt.



CLIVE

The Christmas picnic. I came.



MRS SAUNDERS

I didn’t.



CLIVE

I’m all sticky.



MRS SAUNDERS

What about me? Wait.



CLIVE

All right, are you? Come on. We mustn’t be found.



MRS SAUNDERS

Don’t go now.



CLIVE

Caroline, you are so voracious. Do let go. Tidy yourself up. There’s a hair in my mouth.



CLIVE and MRS SAUNDERS go off. BETTY and MAUD come, with JOSHUA carrying hamper.



MAUD

I never would have thought a guinea fowl could taste so like a turkey.



BETTY

I had to explain to Cook three times.



MAUD

You did very well dear.



JOSHUA sits apart with gun. EDWARD and HARRY with VICTORIA on his shoulder, singing ‘The First Noel’. MAUD and BETTY are unpacking the hamper. CLIVE arrives separately.



MAUD

This tablecloth was one of my mama’s.



BETTY

Uncle Harry playing horsey.



EDWARD

Crackers crackers.



BETTY

Not yet, Edward.



CLIVE

And now the moment we have all been waiting for.



CLIVE opens champagne. General acclaim.



Oh dear, stained my trousers, never mind.



EDWARD

Can I have some?



MAUD

Oh no Edward, not for you.



CLIVE

Give him half a glass.



MAUD

If your father says so.



CLIVE

All rise please. To Her Majesty Queen Victoria, God bless her, and her husband and all her dear children.



ALL

The Queen.



EDWARD

Crackers crackers.



General cracker pulling, hats. CLIVE and HARRY discuss champagne.



HARRY

Excellent, Clive, wherever did you get it?



CLIVE

I know a chap in French Equatorial Africa.



EDWARD

I won, I won Mama.



ELLEN arrives.



BETTY

Give a hat to Joshua, he’d like it.



EDWARD takes hat to JOSHUA. BETTY takes a ball from the hamper and plays catch with ELLEN. Murmurs of surprise and congratulation from the men as they catch the ball.



EDWARD

Mama, don’t play. You know you can’t catch a ball.



BETTY

He’s perfectly right. I can’t throw either.



BETTY sits down. ELLEN has the ball.



EDWARD

Ellen, don’t you play either. You’re no good. You spoil it.



EDWARD takes VICTORIA from HARRY and gives her to ELLEN. He takes the ball and throws it to HARRY. HARRY, CLIVE and EDWARD play ball.



BETTY

Ellen come and sit with me. We’ll be spectators and clap.



EDWARD misses the ball.



CLIVE

Butterfingers.



EDWARD

I’m not.



HARRY

Throw straight now.



EDWARD

I did, I did.



CLIVE

Keep your eye on the ball.



EDWARD

You can’t throw.



CLIVE

Don’t be a baby.



EDWARD

I’m not, throw a hard one, throw a hard one –



CLIVE

Butterfingers. What will Uncle Harry think of you?



EDWARD

It’s your fault. You can’t throw. I hate you.



He throws the ball wildly in the direction of JOSHUA.



CLIVE

Now you’ve lost the ball. He’s lost the ball.



EDWARD

It’s Joshua’s fault. Joshua’s butterfingers.



CLIVE

I don’t think I want to play any more. Joshua, find the ball will you?



EDWARD

Yes, please play. I’ll find the ball. Please play.



CLIVE

You’re so silly and you can’t catch. You’ll be no good at cricket.



MAUD

Why don’t we play hide-and-seek?



EDWARD

Because it’s a baby game.



BETTY

You’ve hurt Edward’s feelings.



CLIVE

A boy has no business having feelings.



HARRY

Hide-and-seek. I’ll be it. Everybody must hide. This is the base, you have to get home to base.



EDWARD

Hide-and-seek, hide-and-seek.



HARRY

Can we persuade the ladies to join us?



MAUD

I’m playing. I love games.



BETTY

I always get found straight away.



ELLEN

Come on, Betty, do. Vicky wants to play.



EDWARD

You won’t find me ever.



They all go except CLIVE, HARRY, JOSHUA.



HARRY

It is safe, I suppose?



CLIVE

They won’t go far. This is very much my territory and it’s broad daylight. Joshua will keep an open eye.



HARRY

Well I must give them a hundred. You don’t know what this means to me, Clive. A chap can only go on so long alone. I can climb mountains and go down rivers, but what’s it for? For Christmas and England and games and women singing. This is the empire, Clive. It’s not me putting a flag in new lands. It’s you. The empire is one big family. I’m one of its black sheep, Clive. And I know you think my life is rather dashing. But I want you to know I admire you. This is the empire, Clive, and I serve it. With all my heart.



CLIVE

I think that’s about a hundred.



HARRY

Ready or not, here I come!



He goes.



CLIVE

Harry Bagley is a fine man, Joshua. You should be proud to know him. He will be in history books.



JOSHUA

Sir, while we are alone.



CLIVE

Joshua of course, what is it? You always have my ear. Any time.



JOSHUA

Sir, I have some information. The stable boys are not to be trusted. They whisper. They go out at night. They visit their people. Their people are not my people. I do not visit my people.



CLIVE

Thank you, Joshua. They certainly look after Beauty. I’ll be sorry to have to replace them.



JOSHUA

They carry knives.



CLIVE

Thank you, Joshua.



JOSHUA

And, sir.



CLIVE

I appreciate this, Joshua, very much.



JOSHUA

Your wife.



CLIVE

Ah, yes?



JOSHUA

She also thinks Harry Bagley is a fine man.



CLIVE

Thank you, Joshua.



JOSHUA

Are you going to hide?



CLIVE

Yes, yes I am. Thank you. Keep your eyes open Joshua.



JOSHUA

I do, sir.



CLIVE goes. JOSHUA goes. HARRY and BETTY race back to base.



BETTY

I can’t run, I can’t run at all.



HARRY

There, I’ve caught you.



BETTY

Harry, what are we going to do?



HARRY

It’s impossible, Betty.



BETTY

Shall we run away together?



MAUD comes.



MAUD

I give up. Don’t catch me. I have been stung.



HARRY

Nothing serious I hope.



MAUD

I have ointment in my bag. I always carry ointment. I shall just sit down and rest. I am too old for all this fun. Hadn’t you better be seeking, Harry?



HARRY goes. MAUD and BETTY are alone for some time. They don’t speak. HARRY and EDWARD race back.



EDWARD

I won, I won, you didn’t catch me.



HARRY

Yes I did.



EDWARD

Mama, who was first?



BETTY

I wasn’t watching. I think it was Harry.



EDWARD

It wasn’t Harry. You’re no good at judging. I won, didn’t I Grandma?



MAUD

I expect so, since it’s Christmas.



EDWARD

I won, Uncle Harry. I’m better than you.



BETTY

Why don’t you help Uncle Harry look for the others?



EDWARD

Shall I?



HARRY

Yes, of course.



BETTY

Run along then. He’s just coming.



EDWARD goes.



Harry, I shall scream.



HARRY

Ready or not here I come.



HARRY runs off.



BETTY

Why don’t you go back to the house, Mother, and rest your insect bite?



MAUD

Betty, my duty is here. I don’t like what I see. Clive wouldn’t like it, Betty. I am your mother.



BETTY

Clive gives you a home because you are my mother.



HARRY comes back.



HARRY

I can’t find anyone else. I’m getting quite hot.



BETTY

Sit down a minute.



HARRY

I can’t do that. I’m he. How’s your sting?



MAUD

It seems to be swelling up.



BETTY

Why don’t you go home and rest? Joshua will go with you. Joshua!



HARRY

I could take you back. MAUD That would be charming.



BETTY

You can’t go. You’re he.



JOSHUA comes.



BETTY

Joshua, my mother wants to go back to the house. Will you go with her please.



JOSHUA

Sir told me I have to keep an eye.



BETTY

I am telling you to go back to the house. Then you can come back here and keep an eye.



MAUD

Thank you Betty. I know we have our little differences, but I always want what is best for you.



JOSHUA and MAUD go.



HARRY

Don’t give way. Keep calm.



BETTY

I shall kill myself.



HARRY

Betty, you are a star in my sky. Without you I would have no sense of direction. I need you, and I need you where you are, I need you to be Clive’s wife. I need to go up rivers and know you are sitting here thinking of me.



BETTY

I want more than that. Is that wicked of me?



HARRY

Not wicked, Betty. Silly.



EDWARD calls in the distance.



EDWARD

Uncle Harry, where are you?



BETTY

Can’t we ever be alone?



HARRY

You are a mother. And a daughter. And a wife.



BETTY

I think I shall go and hide again.



BETTY goes. HARRY goes. CLIVE chases MRS SAUNDERS across the stage. EDWARD and HARRY call in the distance.



EDWARD

Uncle Harry!



HARRY

Edward!



EDWARD comes.



EDWARD

Uncle Harry!



HARRY comes.



There you are. I haven’t found anyone have you?



HARRY

I wonder where they all are.



EDWARD

Perhaps they’re lost for ever. Perhaps they’re dead. There’s trouble going on isn’t there, and nobody says because of not frightening the women and children.



HARRY

Yes, that’s right.



EDWARD

Do you think we’ll be killed in our beds?



HARRY

Not very likely.



EDWARD

I can’t sleep at night. Can you?



HARRY

I’m not used to sleeping in a house.



EDWARD

If I’m awake at night can I come and see you? I won’t wake you up. I’ll only come in if you’re awake.



HARRY

You should try to sleep.



EDWARD

I don’t mind being awake because I make up adventures. Once we were on a raft going down to the rapids. We’ve lost the paddles because we used them to fight off the crocodiles. A crocodile comes at me and I stab it again and again and the blood is everywhere and it tips up the raft and it has you by the leg and it’s biting your leg right off and I take my knife and stab it in the throat and rip open its stomach and it lets go of you but it bites my hand but it’s dead. And I drag you onto the river bank and I’m almost fainting with pain and we lie there in each other’s arms.



HARRY

Have I lost my leg?



EDWARD

I forgot about the leg by then.



HARRY

Hadn’t we better look for the others?



EDWARD

Wait. I’ve got something for you. It was in Mama’s box but she never wears it.



EDWARD gives HARRY a necklace.



You don’t have to wear it either but you might like it to look at.



HARRY

It’s beautiful. But you’ll have to put it back.



EDWARD

I wanted to give it to you.



HARRY

You did. It can go back in the box. You still gave it to me. Come on now, we have to find the others.



EDWARD

Harry, I love you.



HARRY

Yes I know. I love you too.



EDWARD

You know what we did when you were here before. I want to do it again. I think about it all the time. I try to do it to myself but it’s not as good. Don’t you want to any more?



HARRY

I do, but it’s a sin and a crime and it’s also wrong.



EDWARD

But we’ll do it anyway won’t we?



HARRY

Yes of course.



EDWARD

I wish the others would all be killed. Take it out now and let me see it.



HARRY

No.



EDWARD

Is it big now?



HARRY

Yes.



EDWARD

Let me touch it.



HARRY

No.



EDWARD

Just hold me.



HARRY

When you can’t sleep.



EDWARD

We’d better find the others then. Come on.



HARRY

Ready or not, here we come.



They go out with whoops and shouts. BETTY and ELLEN come.



BETTY

Ellen, I don’t want to play any more.



ELLEN

Nor do I, Betty.



BETTY

Come and sit here with me. Oh Ellen, what will become of me?



ELLEN

Betty, are you crying? Are you laughing?



BETTY

Tell me what you think of Harry Bagley.



ELLEN

He’s a very fine man.



BETTY

No, Ellen, what you really think.



ELLEN

I think you think he’s very handsome.



BETTY

And don’t you think he is? Oh Ellen, you’re so good and I’m so wicked.



ELLEN

I’m not so good as you think.



EDWARD comes.



EDWARD

I’ve found you.



ELLEN

We’re not hiding Edward.



EDWARD

But I found you.



ELLEN

We’re not playing, Edward, now run along.



EDWARD

Come on, Ellen, do play. Come on, Mama.



ELLEN

Edward, don’t pull your mama like that.



BETTY

Edward, you must do what your governess says. Go and play with Uncle Harry.



EDWARD

Uncle Harry!



EDWARD goes.



BETTY

Ellen, can you keep a secret?



ELLEN

Oh yes, yes please.



BETTY

I love Harry Bagley. I want to go away with him. There, I’ve said it, it’s true.



ELLEN

How do you know you love him?



BETTY

I kissed him.



ELLEN

Betty.



BETTY

He held my hand like this. Oh I want him to do it again. I want him to stroke my hair.



ELLEN

Your lovely hair. Like this, Betty?



BETTY

I want him to put his arm around my waist.



ELLEN

Like this, Betty?



BETTY

Yes, oh I want him to kiss me again.



ELLEN

Like this Betty?



ELLEN kisses BETTY.



BETTY

Ellen, whatever are you doing? It’s not a joke.



ELLEN

I’m sorry, Betty. You’re so pretty. Harry Bagley doesn’t deserve you. You wouldn’t really go away with him?



BETTY

Oh Ellen, you don’t know what I suffer. You don’t know what love is. Everyone will hate me, but it’s worth it for Harry’s love.



ELLEN

I don’t hate you, Betty, I love you.



BETTY

Harry says we shouldn’t go away. But he says he worships me.



ELLEN

I worship you Betty.



BETTY

Oh Ellen, you are my only friend.



They embrace. The others have all gathered together. MAUD has rejoined the party, and JOSHUA.



CLIVE

Come along everyone, you mustn’t miss Harry’s conjuring trick.



BETTY and ELLEN go to join the others.



MAUD

I didn’t want to spoil the fun by not being here.



HARRY

What is it that flies all over the world and is up my sleeve?



HARRY produces a Union Flag from up his sleeve. General acclaim.



CLIVE

I think we should have some singing now. Ladies, I rely on you to lead the way.



ELLEN

We have a surprise for you. I have taught Joshua a Christmas carol. He has been singing it at the piano but I’m sure he can sing it unaccompanied, can’t you, Joshua?



JOSHUA

In the deep midwinter



Frosty wind made moan,



Earth stood hard as iron, Water like a stone.



Snow had fallen snow on snow



Snow on snow,



In the deep midwinter Long long ago.



What can I give him



Poor as I am?



If I were a shepherd



I would bring a lamb.



If I were a wise man



I would do my part.



What I can I give him?



Give my heart.




Scene Three

Inside the house. BETTY, MRS SAUNDERS, MAUD with VICTORIA. The blinds are down so the light isn’t bright though it is day outside. CLIVE looks in.

CLIVE

Everything all right? Nothing to be frightened of.



CLIVE goes. Silence.



MAUD

Clap hands, Daddy comes, with his pockets full of plums. All for Vicky.



Silence.



MRS SAUNDERS

Who actually does the flogging?



MAUD

I don’t think we want to imagine.



MRS SAUNDERS

I imagine Joshua.



BETTY

Yes I think it would be Joshua. Or would Clive do it himself?



MRS SAUNDERS

Well we can ask them afterwards.



MAUD

I don’t like the way you speak of it, Mrs Saunders.



MRS SAUNDERS

How should I speak of it?



MAUD

The men will do it in the proper way, whatever it is. We have our own part to play.



MRS SAUNDERS

Harry Bagley says they should just be sent away. I don’t think he likes to see them beaten.



BETTY

Harry is so tender-hearted. perhaps he is right.



MAUD

Harry Bagley is not altogether – He has lived in this country a long time without any responsibilities. It is part of his charm but it hasn’t improved his judgement. If the boys were just sent away they would go back to the village and make more trouble.



MRS SAUNDERS

And what will they say about us in the village if they’ve been flogged?



BETTY

Perhaps Clive should keep them here.



MRS SAUNDERS

That is never wise.



BETTY

Whatever shall we do?



MAUD

I don’t think it is up to us to wonder. The men don’t tell us what is going on among the tribes, so how can we possibly make a judgement?



MRS SAUNDERS

I know a little of what is going on.



BETTY

Tell me what you know. Clive tells me nothing.



MAUD

You would not want to be told about it, Betty. It is enough for you that Clive knows what is happening. Clive will know what to do. Your father always knew what to do.



BETTY

Are you saying you would do something different, Caroline?



MRS SAUNDERS

I would do what I did at my own home. I left. I can’t see any way out except to leave. I will leave here. I will keep leaving everywhere I suppose.



MAUD

Luckily this household has a head. I am squeamish myself. But luckily Clive is not.



BETTY

You are leaving here then, Caroline?



MRS SAUNDERS

Not immediately. I’m sorry.



Silence.



I wonder if it’s over.



EDWARD comes in.



BETTY

Shouldn’t you be with the men, Edward?



EDWARD

I didn’t want to see any more. They got what they deserved. Uncle Harry said I could come in.



MRS SAUNDERS

I never allowed the servants to be beaten in my own house. I’m going to find out what’s happening.



MRS SAUNDERS goes out.



BETTY

Will she go and look?



MAUD

Let Mrs Saunders be a warning to you, Betty. She is alone in the world. You are not, thank God. Since your father died, I know what it is to be unprotected. Vicky is such a pretty little girl. Clap hands, Daddy comes, with his pockets full of plums. All for Vicky.



EDWARD, meanwhile, has found the doll and is playing clap hands with her.



BETTY

Edward, what have you got there?



EDWARD

I’m minding her.



BETTY

Edward, I’ve told you before, dolls are for girls.



MAUD

Where is Ellen? She should be looking after Edward. (She goes to the door.) Ellen! Betty, why do you let that girl mope about in her own room? That’s not what she’s come to Africa for.



BETTY

You must never let the boys at school know you like dolls. Never, never. No one will talk to you, you won’t be on the cricket team, you won’t grow up to be a man like your papa.



EDWARD

I don’t want to be like papa. I hate Papa.



MAUD

Edward! Edward!



BETTY

You’re a horrid wicked boy and papa will beat you. Of course you don’t hate him, you love him. Now give Victoria her doll at once.



EDWARD

She’s not Victoria’s doll, she’s my doll. She doesn’t love Victoria and Victoria doesn’t love her. Victoria never even plays with her.



MAUD

Victoria will learn to play with her.



EDWARD

She’s mine and she loves me and she won’t be happy if you take her away, she’ll cry, she’ll cry, she’ll cry.



BETTY takes the doll away, slaps him, bursts into tears. ELLEN comes in.



BETTY

Ellen, look what you’ve done. Edward’s got the doll again. Now, Ellen, will you please do your job.



ELLEN

Edward, you are a wicked boy. I am going to lock you in the nursery until supper time. Now go upstairs this minute.



She slaps EDWARD, who bursts into tears and goes out.



I do try to do what you want. I’m so sorry.



ELLEN bursts into tears and goes out.



MAUD

There now, Vicky’s got her baby back. Where did Vicky’s naughty baby go? Shall we smack her? Just a little smack. (MAUD smacks the doll hard.) There, now she’s a good baby. Clap hands, Daddy comes, with his pockets full of plums. All for Vicky’s baby. When I was a child we honoured our parents. My mama was an angel.



JOSHUA comes in. He stands without speaking.



BETTY

Joshua?



JOSHUA

Madam?



BETTY

Did you want something?



JOSHUA

Sent to see the ladies are all right, madam.



MRS SAUNDERS comes in.



MRS SAUNDERS

We’re very well thank you, Joshua, and how are you?



JOSHUA

Very well thank you, Mrs Saunders.



MRS SAUNDERS

And the stable boys?



JOSHUA

They have had justice, madam.



MRS SAUNDERS

So I saw. And does your arm ache?



MAUD

This is not a proper conversation, Mrs Saunders.



MRS SAUNDERS

You don’t mind beating your own people?



JOSHUA

Not my people, madam.



MRS SAUNDERS

A different tribe?



JOSHUA

Bad people.



HARRY and CLIVE come in.



CLIVE

Well this is all very gloomy and solemn. Can we have the shutters open? The heat of the day has gone, we could have some light, I think. And cool drinks on the verandah, Joshua. Have some lemonade yourself. It is most refreshing. Sunlight floods in as the shutters are opened.



EDWARD comes.



EDWARD

Papa, Papa, Ellen tried to lock me in the nursery. Mama is going to tell you of me. I’d rather tell you myself. I was playing with Vicky’s doll again and I know it’s very bad of me. And I said I didn’t want to be like you and I said I hated you. And it’s not true and I’m sorry, I’m sorry and please beat me and forgive me.



CLIVE

Well there’s a brave boy to own up. You should always respect and love me, Edward, not for myself, I may not deserve it, but as I respected and loved my own father, because he was my father. Through our father we love our Queen and our God, Edward. Do you understand? It is something men understand.



EDWARD

Yes papa.



CLIVE

Then I forgive you and shake you by the hand. You spend too much time with the women. You may spend more time with me and Uncle Harry, little man.



EDWARD

I don’t like women. I don’t like dolls papa, and I love you, Uncle Harry.



CLIVE

There’s a fine fellow. Let us go out onto the verandah.



They all start to go. EDWARD takes HARRY ’s hand and goes with him. CLIVE draws BETTY back. They embrace.



BETTY

Poor Clive.



CLIVE

It was my duty to have them flogged. For you and Edward and Victoria, to keep you safe.



BETTY

It is terrible to feel betrayed.



CLIVE

You can tame a wild animal only so far. They revert to their true nature and savage your hand. Sometimes I feel the natives are the enemy. I know that is wrong. I know I have a responsibility towards them, to care for them and bring them all to be like Joshua. But there is something dangerous. Implacable. This whole continent is my enemy. I am pitching my whole mind and will and reason and spirit against it to tame it, and I sometimes feel it will break over me and swallow me up.



BETTY

Clive, Clive, I am here. I have faith in you.



CLIVE

Yes, I can show you my moments of weakness, Betty, because you are my wife and because I trust you. I trust you, Betty, and it would break my heart if you did not deserve that trust. Harry Bagley is my friend. It would break my heart if he did not deserve my trust.



BETTY

I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Forgive me. It is not Harry’s fault, it is all mine. Harry is noble. He has rejected me. It is my wickedness. I get bored, I get restless, I imagine things. There is something so wicked in me, Clive.



CLIVE

I have never thought of you having the weakness of your sex, only the good qualities.



BETTY

I am bad, bad, bad –



CLIVE

You are thoughtless, Betty, that’s all. Women can be treacherous and evil. They are darker and more dangerous than men. The family protects us from that, you protect me from that. You are not that sort of woman. You are not unfaithful to me, Betty. I can’t believe you are. It would hurt me so much to cast you off. That would be my duty.



BETTY

No, no, no.



CLIVE

Joshua has seen you kissing.



BETTY

Forgive me.



CLIVE

But I don’t want to know about it. I don’t want to know. I wonder of course, I wonder constantly. If Harry Bagley was not my friend I would shoot him. If I shot you every British man and woman would applaud me. But no. It was a moment of passion such as women are too weak to resist. But you must resist it, Betty, or it will destroy us. We must fight against it. We must resist this dark female lust, Betty, or it will swallow us up.



BETTY

I do, I do resist. Help me. Forgive me.



CLIVE

Yes I do forgive you. But I can’t feel the same about you as I did. You are still my wife and we still have duties to the household.



They go out arm in arm. As soon as they have gone EDWARD sneaks back to get the doll, which has been dropped on the floor. He picks it up and comforts it. JOSHUA comes through with a tray of drinks.



JOSHUA

Baby. Sissy. Girly.



JOSHUA goes. BETTY calls from off.



BETTY

Edward?



BETTY comes in.



There you are my darling. Come, papa wants us all to be together. Uncle Harry is going to tell how he caught a crocodile. Mama’s sorry she smacked you.



They embrace. JOSHUA comes in again, passing through.



BETTY

Joshua, fetch me some blue thread from my sewing box. It is on the piano.



JOSHUA

You’ve got legs under that skirt.



BETTY

Joshua.



JOSHUA

And more than legs.



BETTY

Edward, are you going to stand there and let a servant insult your mother?



EDWARD

Joshua, get my mother’s thread.



JOSHUA

Oh little Eddy, playing at master. It’s only a joke.



EDWARD

Don’t speak to my mother like that again.



JOSHUA

Ladies have no sense of humour. You like a joke with Joshua.



EDWARD

You fetch her sewing at once, do you hear me? You move when I speak to you, boy.



JOSHUA

Yes sir, master Edward sir.



JOSHUA goes.



BETTY

Edward, you were wonderful.



She goes to embrace him but he moves away.



EDWARD

Don’t touch me.



ALL (sing ‘A Boy’s Best Friend’)

While plodding on our way, the toilsome road of life,



How few the friends that daily there we meet.



Not many will stand by in trouble and strife,



With counsel and affection ever sweet.



But there is one whose smile will ever on us beam,



Whose love is dearer far than any other;



And wherever we may turn



This lesson we will learn



A boy’s best friend is his mother.



Then cherish her with care



And smooth her silv’ry hair,



When gone you will never get another.



And wherever we may turn



This lesson we shall learn,



A boy’s best friend is his mother.




Scene Four

The verandah as in Scene One. Early morning. Nobody there. JOSHUA comes out of the house slowly and stands for some time doing nothing. EDWARD comes out.

EDWARD

Tell me another bad story, Joshua. Nobody else is even awake yet.



JOSHUA

First there was nothing and then there was the great goddess. She was very large and she had golden eyes and she made the stars and the sun and the earth. But soon she was miserable and lonely and she cried like a great waterfall and her tears made all the rivers in the world. So the great spirit sent a terrible monster, a tree with hundreds of eyes and a long green tongue, and it came chasing after her and she jumped into a lake and the tree jumped in after her, and she jumped right up into the sky. And the tree couldn’t follow, he was stuck in the mud. So he picked up a big handful of mud and he threw it at her, up among the stars, and it hit her on the head. And she fell down onto the earth into his arms and the ball of mud is the moon in the sky. And then they had children which is all of us.



EDWARD

It’s not true, though.



JOSHUA

Of course it’s not true. It’s a bad story. Adam and Eve is true. God made man white like him and gave him the bad woman who liked the snake and gave us all this trouble.



CLIVE and HARRY come out.



CLIVE

Run along now, Edward. No, you may stay. You mustn’t repeat anything you hear to your mother or your grandmother or Ellen.



EDWARD

Or Mrs Saunders?



CLIVE

Mrs Saunders is an unusual woman and does not require protection in the same way. Harry, there was trouble last night where we expected it. But it’s all over now. Everything is under control but nobody should leave the house today I think.



HARRY

Casualties?



CLIVE

No, none of the soldiers hurt thank God. We did a certain amount of damage, set a village on fire and so forth.



HARRY

Was that necessary?



CLIVE

Obviously, it was necessary, Harry, or it wouldn’t have happened. The army will come and visit, no doubt. You’ll like that, eh, Joshua, to see the British army? And a treat for you, Edward, to see the soldiers. Would you like to be a soldier?



EDWARD

I’d rather be an explorer.



CLIVE

Ah, Harry, like you, you see. I didn’t know an explorer at his age. Breakfast, I think, Joshua.



CLIVE and JOSHUA go in. HARRY is following.



EDWARD

Uncle.



HARRY stops.



Harry, why won’t you talk to me?



HARRY

Of course I’ll talk to you.



EDWARD

If you won’t be nice to me I’ll tell father.



HARRY

Edward, no, not a word, never, not to your mother, nobody, please. Edward, do you understand? Please.



EDWARD

I won’t tell. I promise I’ll never tell. I’ve cut my finger and sworn.



HARRY

There’s no need to get so excited Edward. We can’t be together all the time. I will have to leave soon anyway, and go back to the river.



EDWARD

You can’t, you can’t go. Take me with you.



ELLEN

Edward!



HARRY

I have my duty to the Empire.



HARRY goes in. ELLEN comes out.



ELLEN

Edward, breakfast time. Edward.



EDWARD

I’m not hungry.



ELLEN

Betty, please come and speak to Edward.



BETTY comes.



BETTY

Why, what’s the matter?



ELLEN

He won’t come in for breakfast.



BETTY

Edward, I shall call your father.



EDWARD

You can’t make me eat.



He goes in. BETTY is about to follow.



ELLEN

Betty.



BETTY stops.



Betty, when Edward goes to school will I have to leave?



BETTY

Never mind, Ellen dear, you’ll get another place. I’ll give you an excellent reference.



ELLEN

I don’t want another place, Betty. I want to stay with you for ever.



BETTY

If you go back to England you might get married, Ellen. You’re quite pretty, you shouldn’t despair of getting a husband.



ELLEN

I don’t want a husband. I want you.



BETTY

Children of your own, Ellen, think.



ELLEN

I don’t want children, I don’t like children. I just want to be alone with you, Betty, and sing for you and kiss you because I love you, Betty.



BETTY

I love you too, Ellen. But women have their duty as soldiers have. You must be a mother if you can.



ELLEN

Betty, Betty, I love you so much. I want to stay with you for ever, my love for you is eternal, stronger than death. I’d rather die than leave you, Betty.



BETTY

No you wouldn’t, Ellen, don’t be silly. Come, don’t cry. You don’t feel what you think you do. It’s the loneliness here and the climate is very confusing. Come and have breakfast, Ellen dear, and I’ll forget all about it.



ELLEN goes. CLIVE comes.



BETTY

Clive, please forgive me.



CLIVE

Will you leave me alone?



BETTY goes back into the house. HARRY comes.



Women, Harry. I envy you going into the jungle, a man’s life.



HARRY

I envy you.



CLIVE

Harry, I know you do. I have spoken to Betty.



HARRY

I assure you, Clive –



CLIVE

Please say nothing about it.



HARRY

My friendship for you –



CLIVE

Absolutely. I know the friendship between us, Harry, is not something that could be spoiled by the weaker sex. Friendship between men is a fine thing. It is the noblest form of relationship.



HARRY

I agree with you.



CLIVE

There is the necessity of reproduction. The family is all important. And there is the pleasure. But what we put ourselves through to get the pleasure, Harry. When I heard about our fine fellows last night fighting those savages to protect us I thought yes, that is what I aspire to. I tell you Harry, in confidence, I suddenly got out of Mrs Saunders’ bed and came out here on the verandah and looked at the stars.



HARRY

I couldn’t sleep last night either.



CLIVE

There is something dark about women, that threatens what is best in us. Between men that light burns brightly.



HARRY

I didn’t know you felt like that.



CLIVE

Women are irrational, demanding, inconsistent, treacherous, lustful, and they smell different from us.



HARRY

Clive –



CLIVE

Think of the comradeship of men, Harry, sharing adventures, sharing danger, risking their lives together.



HARRY takes hold of CLIVE.



CLIVE

What are you doing?



HARRY

Well, you said –



CLIVE

I said what?



HARRY

Between men.



CLIVE is speechless.



I’m sorry, I misunderstood, I would never have dreamt, I thought –



CLIVE

My God, Harry, how disgusting.



HARRY

You will not betray my confidence.



CLIVE

I feel contaminated.



HARRY

I struggle against it. You cannot imagine the shame. I have tried everything to save myself.



CLIVE

The most revolting perversion. Rome fell, Harry, and this sin can destroy an empire.



HARRY

It is not a sin, it is a disease.



CLIVE

A disease more dangerous than diphtheria. Effeminacy is contagious. How I have been deceived. Your face does not look degenerate. Oh Harry, how did you sink to this?



HARRY

Clive, help me, what am I to do?



CLIVE

You have been away from England too long.



HARRY

Where can I go except into the jungle to hide?



CLIVE

You don’t do it with the natives, Harry? My God, what a betrayal of the Queen.



HARRY

Clive, I am like a man born crippled. Please help me.



CLIVE

You must repent.



HARRY

I have thought of killing myself.



CLIVE

That is a sin too.



HARRY

There is no way out. Clive, I beg of you, do not betray my confidence.



CLIVE

I cannot keep a secret like this. Rivers will be named after you, it’s unthinkable. You must save yourself from depravity. You must get married. You are not unattractive to women. What a relief that you and Betty were not after all – good God, how disgusting. Now Mrs Saunders. She’s a woman of spirit, she could go with you on your expeditions.



HARRY

I suppose getting married wouldn’t be any worse than killing myself.



CLIVE

Mrs Saunders! Mrs Saunders! Ask her now, Harry. Think of England.



MRS SAUNDERS comes. CLIVE withdraws. HARRY goes up to MRS SAUNDERS.



HARRY

Mrs Saunders, will you marry me?



MRS SAUNDERS

Why?



HARRY

We are both alone.



MRS SAUNDERS

I choose to be alone, Mr Bagley. If I can look after myself, I’m sure you can. Clive, I have something important to tell you. I’ve just found Joshua putting earth on his head. He tells me his parents were killed last night by the British soldiers. I think you owe him an apology on behalf of the Queen.



CLIVE

Joshua! Joshua!



MRS SAUNDERS

Mr Bagley, I could never be a wife again. There is only one thing about marriage that I like.



JOSHUA comes.



CLIVE

Joshua, I am horrified to hear what has happened. Good God.



MRS SAUNDERS

His father was shot. His mother died in the blaze.



MRS SAUNDERS goes.



CLIVE

Joshua, do you want a day off? Do you want to go to your people?



JOSHUA

Not my people, sir.



CLIVE

But you want to go to your parents’ funeral?



JOSHUA

No sir.



CLIVE

Yes, Joshua, yes, your father and mother. I’m sure they were loyal to the Crown. I’m sure it was all a terrible mistake.



JOSHUA

My mother and father were bad people.



CLIVE

Joshua, no.



JOSHUA

You are my father and mother.



CLIVE

Well really. I don’t know what to say. That’s very decent of you. Are you sure there’s nothing I can do? You can have the day off you know.



BETTY comes out followed by EDWARD.



BETTY

What’s the matter? What’s happening?



CLIVE

Something terrible has happened. No, I mean some relatives of Joshua’s met with an accident.



JOSHUA

May I go sir?



CLIVE

Yes, yes of course. Good God, what a terrible thing. Bring us a drink will you Joshua?



JOSHUA goes.



EDWARD

What? What?



BETTY

Edward, go and do your lessons.



EDWARD

What is it, Uncle Harry?



HARRY

Go and do your lessons.



ELLEN

Edward, come in here at once.



EDWARD

What’s happened, Uncle Harry?



HARRY has moved aside. EDWARD follows him. ELLEN comes out.



HARRY

Go away. Go inside. Ellen!



ELLEN

Go inside, Edward. I shall tell your mother.



BETTY

Go inside, Edward at once. I shall tell your father.



CLIVE

Go inside, Edward. And Betty you go inside too.



BETTY, EDWARD and ELLEN go. MAUD comes out.



Go inside. And Ellen, you come outside.



ELLEN comes out.



Mr Bagley has something to say to you.



HARRY

Ellen. I don’t suppose you would marry me?



ELLEN

What if I said yes?



CLIVE

Run along now, you two want to be alone.



HARRY and ELLEN go out. JOSHUA brings CLIVE a drink.



JOSHUA

The governess and your wife, sir.



CLIVE

What’s that, Joshua?



JOSHUA

She talks of love to your wife, sir. I have seen them. Bad women.



CLIVE

Joshua, you go too far. Get out of my sight.




Scene Five

The verandah. A table with a white cloth. A wedding cake and a large knife. Bottles and glasses. JOSHUA is putting things on the table. EDWARD has the doll. JOSHUA sees him with it. He holds out his hand.

EDWARD gives him the doll. JOSHUA takes the knife and cuts the doll open and shakes the sawdust out of it. JOSHUA throws the doll under the table.

MAUD

Come along Edward, this is such fun.



Everyone enters, triumphal arch for HARRY and ELLEN.



Your mama’s wedding was a splendid occasion, Edward. I cried and cried.



ELLEN and BETTY go aside.



ELLEN

Betty, what happens with a man? I don’t know what to do.



BETTY

You just keep still.



ELLEN

And what does he do?



BETTY

Harry will know what to do.



ELLEN

And is it enjoyable?



BETTY

Ellen, you’re not getting married to enjoy yourself.



ELLEN

Don’t forget me, Betty.



ELLEN goes.



BETTY

I think my necklace has been stolen Clive. I did so want to wear it at the wedding.



EDWARD

It was Joshua. Joshua took it.



CLIVE

Joshua?



EDWARD

He did, he did, I saw him with it.



HARRY

Edward, that’s not true.



EDWARD

It is, it is.



HARRY

Edward, I’m afraid you took it yourself.



EDWARD

I did not.



HARRY

I have seen him with it.



CLIVE

Edward, is that true? Where is it? Did you take your mother’s necklace? And to try and blame Joshua, good God.



EDWARD runs off.



BETTY

Edward, come back. Have you got my necklace?



HARRY

I should leave him alone. He’ll bring it back.



BETTY

I wanted to wear it. I wanted to look my best at your wedding.



HARRY

You always look your best to me.



BETTY

I shall get drunk.



MRS SAUNDERS comes.



MRS SAUNDERS

The sale of my property is completed. I shall leave tomorrow.



CLIVE

That’s just as well. Whose protection will you seek this time?



MRS SAUNDERS

I shall go to England and buy a farm there. I shall introduce threshing machines.



CLIVE

Amazing spirit.



He kisses her. BETTY launches herself on MRS SAUNDERS. They fall to the ground.



Betty – Caroline – I don’t deserve this – Harry, Harry.



HARRY and CLIVE separate them. HARRY holding MRS SAUNDERS, CLIVE BETTY.



Mrs Saunders, how can you abuse my hospitality? How dare you touch my wife? You must leave here at once.



BETTY

Go away, go away. You are a wicked woman.



MAUD

Mrs Saunders, I am shocked. This is your hostess.



CLIVE

Pack your bags and leave the house this instant.



MRS SAUNDERS

I was leaving anyway. There’s no place for me here. I have made arrangements to leave tomorrow, and tomorrow is when I will leave. I wish you joy, Mr Bagley.



MRS SAUNDERS goes.



CLIVE

No place for her anywhere I should think. Shocking behaviour.



BETTY

Oh Clive, forgive me, and love me like you used to.



CLIVE

Were you jealous my dove? My own dear wife!



MAUD

Ah, Mr Bagley, one flesh, you see.



EDWARD comes back with the necklace.



CLIVE

Good God, Edward, it’s true.



EDWARD

I was minding it for Mama because of the troubles.



CLIVE

Well done, Edward, that was very manly of you. See Betty? Edward was protecting his mama’s jewels from the rebels. What a hysterical fuss over nothing. Well done, little man. It is quite safe now. The bad men are dead. Edward, you may do up the necklace for Mama.



EDWARD does up BETTY’s necklace, supervised by CLIVE. JOSHUA is drinking steadily. ELLEN comes back.



MAUD

Ah, here’s the bride. Come along, Ellen, you don’t cry at your own wedding, only at other people’s.



CLIVE

Now, speeches, speeches. Who is going to make a speech? Harry, make a speech.



HARRY

I’m no speaker. You’re the one for that.



ALL

Speech, speech.



HARRY

My dear friends – what can I say – the empire – the family – the married state to which I have always aspired – your shining example of domestic bliss – my great good fortune in winning Ellen’s love – happiest day of my life.



Applause.



CLIVE

Cut the cake, cut the cake.



HARRY and ELLEN take the knife to cut the cake. HARRY steps on the doll under the table.



HARRY

What’s this?



ELLEN

Oh look.



BETTY

Edward.



EDWARD

It was Joshua. It was Joshua. I saw him.



CLIVE

Don’t tell lies again.



He hits EDWARD across the side of the head.



Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking –



Cheers.



Harry, my friend. So brave and strong and supple. Ellen, from ’neath her veil so shyly peeking. I wish you joy. A toast – the happy couple. Dangers are past. Our enemies are killed. Put your arm around her, Harry, have a kiss – All murmuring of discontent is stilled. Long may you live in peace and joy and bliss.



While he is speaking, JOSHUA raises his gun to shoot CLIVE. Only EDWARD sees. He does nothing to warn the others. He put his hands over his ears. BLACK.





ACT TWO

Scene One

GERRY

The train from Victoria to Clapham still has those compartments without a corridor. As soon as I got on the platform I saw who I wanted. Slim hips, tense shoulders, trying not to look at anyone. I put my hand on my packet just long enough so that he couldn’t miss it. The train came in. You don’t want to get in too fast or some straight dumbo might get in with you. I sat by the window. I couldn’t see where the fuck he’d got to. Then just as the whistle went he got in. Great. It’s a six-minute journey so you can’t start anything you can’t finish. I stared at him and he unzipped his flies. Then he stopped. So I stood up and took my cock out. He took me in his mouth and shut his eyes tight. He was sort of mumbling it about as if he wasn’t sure what to do, so I said, A bit tighter son and he said Sorry and then got on with it. He was jerking off with his left hand, and I could see he’d got a fair-sized one. I wished he’d keep still so I could see his watch. I was getting really turned on. What if we pulled into Clapham Junction now. Of course by the time we sat down again the train was just slowing up. I felt wonderful. Then he started talking. It’s better if nothing is said. Once you find he’s a librarian in Walthamstow with a special interest in science fiction and lives with his aunt, then forget it. He said I hope you don’t think I do this all the time. I said I hope you will from now on. He said he would if I was on the train, but why don’t we go out for a meal? I opened the door before the train stopped. I told him I lived with somebody. I don’t want to know. He was jogging sideways to keep up. He said What’s your phone number, you’re my ideal physical type, what sign of the zodiac are you? Where do you live? Where are you going now? It’s not fair. I saw him at Victoria a couple of months later and I went straight down to the end of the platform and I picked up somebody really great who never said a word, just smiled.



Winter afternoon. Inside the hut of a one o’clock club, a children’s play centre in a park, VICTORIA and LIN, mothers. CATHY, LIN’s daughter, aged 4, played by a man, clinging to LIN. VICTORIA reading a book.

CATHY

Yum yum bubblegum.



Stick it up your mother’s bum.



When it’s brown



Pull it down



Yum yum bubblegum.



LIN

Like your shoes, Victoria.



CATHY

Jack be nimble, Jack be quick,



Jack jump over the candlestick.



Silly Jack, he should jump higher,



Goodness gracious, great balls of fire.



LIN

Cathy, do stop. Do a painting.



CATHY

You do a painting.



LIN

You do a painting.



CATHY

What shall I paint?



LIN

Paint a house.



CATHY

No.



LIN

Princess.



CATHY

No.



LIN

Pirates.



CATHY

Already done that.



LIN

Spacemen.



CATHY

I never paint spacemen. You know I never.



LIN

Paint a car crash and blood everywhere.



CATHY

No, don’t tell me. I know what to paint.



LIN

Go on then. You need an apron, where’s an apron. Here.



CATHY

Don’t want an apron.



LIN

Lift up your arms. There’s a good girl.



CATHY

I don’t want to paint.



LIN

Don’t paint. Don’t paint.



CATHY

What shall I do? You paint. What shall I do Mum?



VICTORIA

There’s nobody on the big bike, Cathy, quick.



CATHY goes out. VICTORIA is watching the children playing outside.



VICTORIA

Tommy, it’s Jimmy’s gun. Let him have it. What the hell.



She goes on reading. She reads while she talks.



LIN

I don’t know how you can concentrate.



VICTORIA

You have to or you never do anything.



LIN

Yeah well. It’s really warm in here, that’s one thing. It’s better than standing out there. I got chilblains last winter.



VICTORIA

It is warm.



LIN

I suppose Tommy doesn’t let you read much. I expect he talks to you while you’re reading.



VICTORIA

Yes, he does.



LIN

I didn’t get very far with that book you lent me.



VICTORIA

That’s all right.



LIN

I was glad to have it, though. I sit with it on my lap while I’m watching telly. Well, Cathy’s off. She’s frightened I’m going to leave her. It’s the babyminder didn’t work out when she was two, she still remembers. You can’t get them used to other people if you’re by yourself. It’s no good blaming me. She clings round my knees every morning up the nursery and they don’t say anything but they make you feel you’re making her do it. But I’m desperate for her to go to school. I did cry when I left her the first day. You wouldn’t, you’re too fucking sensible. You’ll call the teacher by her first name. I really fancy you.



VICTORIA

What?



LIN

Put your book down will you for five minutes. You didn’t hear a word I said.



VICTORIA

I don’t get much time to myself.



LIN

Do you ever go to the movies?



VICTORIA

Tommy’s very funny who he’s left with. My mother babysits sometimes.



LIN

Your husband could babysit.



VICTORIA

But then we couldn’t go to the movies.



LIN

You could go to the movies with me.



VICTORIA

Oh I see.



LIN

Couldn’t you?



VICTORIA

Well yes, I could.



LIN

Friday night?



VICTORIA

What film are we talking about?



LIN

Does it matter what film?



VICTORIA

Of course it does.



LIN

You choose then. Friday night.



CATHY comes in with gun, shoots them saying kiou kiou kiou, and runs off again.



Not in a foreign language, OK. You don’t go to the movies to read.



LIN watches the children playing outside.



Don’t hit him, Cathy, kill him. Point the gun, kiou, kiou, kiou. That’s the way.



VICTORIA

They’ve just banned war toys in Sweden.



LIN

The kids’ll just hit each other more.



VICTORIA

Well, psychologists do differ in their opinions as to whether or not aggression is innate.



LIN

Yeah?



VICTORIA

I’m afraid I do let Tommy play with guns and just hope he’ll get it out of his system and not end up in the army.



LIN

I’ve got a brother in the army.



VICTORIA

Oh I’m sorry. Whereabouts is he stationed?



LIN

Belfast.



VICTORIA

Oh dear.



LIN

I’ve got a friend who’s Irish and we went on a Troops Out march. Now my dad won’t speak to me.



VICTORIA

I don’t get on too well with my father either.



LIN

And your husband? How do you get on with him?



VICTORIA

Oh, fine. Up and down. You know. Very well. He helps with the washing up and everything.



LIN

I left mine two years ago. He let me keep Cathy and I’m grateful for that.



VICTORIA

You shouldn’t be grateful.



LIN

I’m a lesbian.



VICTORIA

You still shouldn’t be grateful.



LIN

I’m grateful he didn’t hit me harder than he did.



VICTORIA

I suppose I’m very lucky, with Martin.



LIN

Don’t get at me about how I bring up Cathy, OK?



VICTORIA

I didn’t.



LIN

Yes you did. War toys. I’ll give her a rifle for Christmas and blast Tommy’s pretty head off for a start.



VICTORIA goes back to her book.



I hate men.



VICTORIA

You have to look at it in a historical perspective in terms of learnt behaviour since the industrial revolution.



LIN

I just hate the bastards.



VICTORIA

Well it’s a point of view.



By now CATHY has come back in and started painting in many colours, without an apron. EDWARD comes in.



EDWARD

Victoria, mother’s in the park. She’s walking round all the paths very fast.



VICTORIA

By herself.



EDWARD

I told her you were here.



VICTORIA

Thanks.



EDWARD

Come on.



VICTORIA

Ten minutes talking to my mother and I have to spend two hours in a hot bath.



VICTORIA goes out.



LIN

Shit, Cathy, what about an apron. I don’t mind you having paint on your frock but if it doesn’t wash off just don’t tell me you can’t wear a frock with paint on, OK?



CATHY

OK.



LIN

You’re gay, aren’t you?



EDWARD

I beg your pardon?



LIN

I really fancy your sister. I thought you’d understand. You do but you can go on pretending you don’t, I don’t mind. That’s lovely Cathy, I like the green bit.



EDWARD

Don’t go around saying that. I might lose my job.



LIN

The last gardener was ever so straight. He used to flash at all the little girls.



EDWARD

I wish you hadn’t said that about me. It’s not true.



LIN

It’s not true and I never said it and I never thought it and I never will think it again.



EDWARD

Someone might have heard you.



LIN

Shut up about it then.



BETTY and VICTORIA come up.



BETTY

It’s quite a nasty bump.



VICTORIA

He’s not even crying.



BETTY

I think that’s very worrying. You and Edward always cried. Perhaps he’s got concussion.



VICTORIA

Of course he hasn’t Mummy.



BETTY

That other little boy was very rough. Should you speak to somebody about him?



VICTORIA

Tommy was hitting him with a spade.



BETTY

Well he’s a real little boy. And so brave not to cry. You must watch him for signs of drowsiness. And nausea. If he’s sick in the night, phone an ambulance. Well, you’re looking very well darling, a bit tired, a bit peaky. I think the fresh air agrees with Edward. He likes the open-air life because of growing up in Africa. He misses the sunshine, don’t you, darling? We’ll soon have Edward back on his feet. What fun it is here.



VICTORIA

This is Lin. And Cathy.



BETTY

Oh Cathy what a lovely painting. What is it? Well I think it’s a house on fire. I think all that red is a fire. Is that right? Or do I see legs, is it a horse? Can I have the lovely painting or is it for Mummy? Children have such imagination, it makes them so exhausting. (To LIN.) I’m sure you’re wonderful, just like Victoria. I had help with my children. One does need help. That was in Africa of course so there wasn’t the servant problem. This is my son Edward. This is –



EDWARD

Lin.



BETTY

Lin, this is Lin. Edward is doing something such fun, he’s working in the park as a gardener. He does look exactly like a gardener.



EDWARD

I am a gardener.



BETTY

He’s certainly making a stab at it. Well it will be a story to tell. I expect he will write a novel about it, or perhaps a television series. Well what a pretty child Cathy is. Victoria was a pretty child just like a little doll – you can’t be certain how they’ll grow up. I think Victoria’s very pretty but she doesn’t make the most of herself, do you darling, it’s not the fashion I’m told but there are still women who dress out of Vogue, well we hope that’s not what Martin looks for, though in many ways I wish it was, I don’t know what it is Martin looks for and nor does he I’m afraid poor Martin. Well I am rattling on. I like your skirt dear but your shoes won’t do at all. Well do they have lady gardeners, Edward, because I’m going to leave your father and I think I might need to get a job, not a gardener really of course. I haven’t got green fingers I’m afraid, everything I touch shrivels straight up. Vicky gave me a poinsettia last Christmas and the leaves all fell off on Boxing Day. Well good heavens, look what’s happened to that lovely painting.



CATHY has slowly and carefully been going over the whole sheet with black paint. She has almost finished.



LIN

What you do that for silly? It was nice.



CATHY

I like your earrings.



VICTORIA

Did you say you’re leaving Daddy?



BETTY

Do you darling? Shall I put them on you? My ears aren’t pierced, I never wanted that, they just clip on the lobe.



LIN

She’ll get paint on you, mind.



BETTY

There’s a pretty girl. It doesn’t hurt does it? Well you’ll grow up to know you have to suffer a little bit for beauty.



CATHY

Look mum I’m pretty, I’m pretty, I’m pretty.



LIN

Stop showing off Cathy.



VICTORIA

It’s time we went home. Tommy, time to go home. Last go then, all right.



EDWARD

Mum did I hear you right just now?



CATHY

I want my ears pierced.



BETTY

Ooh, not till you’re big.



CATHY

I know a girl got her ears pierced and she’s three. She’s got real gold.



BETTY

I don’t expect she’s English, darling. Can I give her a sweetie? I know they’re not very good for the teeth, Vicky gets terribly cross with me. What does Mummy say?



LIN

Just one, thank you very much.



CATHY

I like your beads.



BETTY

Yes they are pretty. Here you are.



It is the necklace from Act One.



CATHY

Look at me, look at me. Vicky, Vicky look at me.



LIN

You look lovely, come on now.



CATHY

And your hat, and your hat.



LIN

No, that’s enough.



BETTY

Of course she can have my hat.



CATHY

Yes, yes, hat, hat. Look look look.



LIN

That’s enough, please, stop it now. Hat off, bye-bye hat.



CATHY

Give me my hat.



LIN

Bye-bye beads.



BETTY

It’s just fun.



LIN

It’s very nice of you.



CATHY

I want my beads.



LIN

Where’s the other earring?



CATHY

I want my beads.



CATHY has the other earring in her hand. Meanwhile VICTORIA and EDWARD look for it.



EDWARD

Is it on the floor?



VICTORIA

Don’t step on it.



EDWARD

Where?



CATHY

I want my beads. I want my beads.



LIN

You’ll have a smack.



LIN gets the earring from CATHY.



CATHY

I want my beads.



BETTY

Oh dear oh dear. Have you got the earring? Thank you darling.



CATHY

I want my beads, you’re horrid, I hate you, Mum, you smell.



BETTY

This is the point you see where one had help. Well it’s been lovely seeing you dears and I’ll be off again on my little walk.



VICTORIA

You’re leaving him? Really?



BETTY

Yes you hear a’right, Vicky, yes. I’m finding a little flat, that will be fun. Bye-bye Tommy, Granny’s going now. Tommy don’t hit that little girl, say goodbye to Granny.



BETTY goes.



VICTORIA

Fucking hell.



EDWARD

Puking Jesus.



LIN

That was news was it, leaving your father?



EDWARD

They’re going to want so much attention.



VICTORIA

Does everybody hate their mothers?



EDWARD

Mind you, I wouldn’t live with him.



LIN

Stop snivelling, pigface. Where’s your coat? Be quiet now and we’ll have doughnuts for tea and if you keep on we’ll have dogshit on toast.



CATHY laughs so much she lies on the floor.



VICTORIA

Tommy, you’ve had two last goes. Last last last last go.



LIN

Not that funny, come on, coat on.



EDWARD

Can I have your painting?



CATHY

What for?



EDWARD

For a friend of mine.



CATHY

What’s his name?



EDWARD

Gerry.



CATHY

How old is he?



EDWARD

Thirty-two.



CATHY

You can if you like. I don’t care. Kiou kiou kiou kiou.



CATHY goes out. EDWARD takes the painting and goes out.



LIN

Will you have sex with me?



VICTORIA

I don’t know what Martin would say. Does it count as adultery with a woman?



LIN

You’d enjoy it.




Scene Two

Spring. Swing, bench, pond nearby. EDWARD is gardening. GERRY is sitting on a bench.

EDWARD

I sometimes pretend we don’t know each other. And you’ve come to the park to eat your sandwiches and look at me.



GERRY

That would be more interesting, yes. Come and sit down.



EDWARD

If the superintendent comes I’ll be in trouble. It’s not my dinner time yet. Where were you last night? I think you owe me an explanation. We always do tell each other everything.



GERRY

Is that a rule?



EDWARD

It’s what we agreed.



GERRY

It’s a habit we’ve got into. Look, I was drunk. I woke up at four o’clock on somebody’s floor. I was sick. I hadn’t any money for a cab. I went back to sleep.



EDWARD

You could have phoned.



GERRY

There wasn’t a phone.



EDWARD

Sorry.



GERRY

There was a phone and I didn’t phone you. Leave it alone, Eddy, I’m warning you.



EDWARD

What are you going to do to me, then?



GERRY

I’m going to the pub.



EDWARD

I’ll join you in ten minutes.



GERRY

I didn’t ask you to come.



EDWARD goes. CATHY is on the swing.



CATHY

Batman and Robin



Had a batmobile.



Robin done a fart



And paralysed the wheel.



The wheel couldn’t take it,



The engine fell apart,



All because of Robin



And his supersonic fart.



CATHY goes. MARTIN, VICTORIA and BETTY walking slowly.



MARTIN

Tom!



BETTY

He’ll fall in.



VICTORIA

No he won’t.



MARTIN

Don’t go too near the edge, Tom. Throw the bread from there. The ducks can get it.



BETTY

I’ll never be able to manage. If I can’t even walk down the street by myself. Everything looks so fierce.



VICTORIA

Just watch Tommy feeding the ducks.



BETTY

He’s going to fall in. Make Martin make him move back.



VICTORIA

He’s not going to fall in.



BETTY

It’s since I left your father.



VICTORIA

Mummy, it really was the right decision.



BETTY

Everything comes at me from all directions. Martin despises me.



VICTORIA

Of course he doesn’t Mummy.



BETTY

Of course he does.



MARTIN

Throw the bread. That’s the way. The duck can get it. Quack quack quack quack quack.



BETTY

I don’t want to take pills. Lin says you can’t trust doctors.



VICTORIA

You’re not taking pills. You’re doing very well.



BETTY

But I’m so frightened.



VICTORIA

What are you frightened of?



BETTY

Victoria, you always ask that as if there was suddenly going to be an answer.



VICTORIA

Are you all right sitting there?



BETTY

Yes, yes. Go and be with Martin.



VICTORIA joins MARTIN. BETTY stays sitting on the bench.



MARTIN

You take the job, you go to Manchester. You turn it down, you stay in London. People are making decisions like this every day of the week. It needn’t be for more than a year. You get long vacations. Our relationship might well stand the strain of that, and if it doesn’t we’re better out of it. I don’t want to put any pressure on you. I’d just like to know so we can sell the house. I think we’re moving into an entirely different way of life if you go to Manchester because it won’t end there. We could keep the house as security for Tommy but he might as well get used to the fact that life nowadays is insecure. You should ask your mother what she thinks and then do the opposite. I could just take that room in Barbara’s house, and then we could babysit for each other. You think that means I want to fuck Barbara. I don’t. Well I do, but I won’t. And even if I did, what’s a fuck between friends? Who are we meant to do it with, strangers? Whatever you want to do, I’ll be delighted. If you could just let me know what it is I’m to be delighted about. Don’t cry again, Vicky, I’m not the sort of man who makes women cry.



LIN has come in and sat down with BETTY. CATHY joins them. She is wearing a pink dress and carrying a rifle.



LIN

I’ve bought her three new frocks. She won’t wear jeans to school any more because Tracy and Mandy called her a boy.



CATHY

Tracy’s got a perm.



LIN

You should have shot them.



CATHY

They’re coming to tea and we’ve got to have trifle. Not trifle you make, trifle out of a packet. And you’ve got to wear a skirt. And tights.



LIN

Tracy’s mum wears jeans.



CATHY

She does not. She wears velvet.



BETTY

Well I think you look very pretty. And if that gun has caps in it please take it a long way away.



CATHY

It’s got red caps. They’re louder.



MARTIN

Do you think you’re well enough to do this job? You don’t have to do it. No one’s going to think any the less of you if you stay here with me. There’s no point being so liberated you make yourself cry all the time. You stay and we’ll get everything sorted out. What it is about sex, when we talk while it’s happening I get to feel it’s like a driving lesson. Left, right, a little faster, carry on, slow down –



CATHY shoots VICTORIA.



CATHY

You’re dead Vicky.



VICTORIA

Aaaargh.



CATHY

Fall over.



VICTORIA

I’m not falling over, the ground’s wet.



CATHY

You’re dead.



VICTORIA

Yes, I’m dead.



CATHY

The Dead Hand Gang fall over. They said I had to fall over in the mud or I can’t play. That duck’s a mandarin.



MARTIN

Which one? Look, Tommy?



CATHY

That’s a diver. It’s got a yellow eye and it dives. That’s a goose. Tommy doesn’t know it’s a goose, he thinks it’s a duck. The babies get eaten by weasels. Kiou kiou.



CATHY goes.



MARTIN

So I lost my erection last night, not because I’m not prepared to talk, it’s just that taking in technical information is a different part of the brain and also I don’t like to feel that you do it better to yourself. I have read the Hite Report. I do know that women have to learn to get their pleasure despite our clumsy attempts at expressing undying devotion and ecstasy, and that what we spent our adolescence thinking was an animal urge we had to suppress is in fact a fine art we have to acquire. I’m not like whatever percentage of American men have become impotent as a direct result of women’s liberation, which I am totally in favour of, more I sometimes think than you are yourself. Nor am I one of your villains who sticks it in, bangs away, and falls asleep. My one aim is to give you pleasure. My one aim is to give you rolling orgasms like I do other women. So why the hell don’t you have them? My analysis for what it’s worth is that despite all my efforts you still feel dominated by me. I in fact think it’s very sad that you don’t feel able to take that job. It makes me feel very guilty. I don’t want you to do it just because I encourage you to do it. But don’t you think you’d feel better if you did take the job? You’re the one who’s talked about freedom. You’re the one who’s experimenting with bisexuality, and I don’t stop you, I think women have something to give each other.



You seem to need the mutual support. You find me too overwhelming. So follow it through, go away, leave me and Tommy alone for a bit, we can manage perfectly well without you. I’m not putting any pressure on you but I don’t think you’re being a whole person. God knows I do everything I can to make you stand on your own two feet. Just be yourself. You don’t seem to realise how insulting it is to me that you can’t get yourself together.



MARTIN and VICTORIA go.



BETTY

You must be very lonely yourself with no husband. You don’t miss him?



LIN

Not really, no.



BETTY

Maybe you like being on your own.



LIN

I’m seeing quite a lot of Vicky. I don’t live alone. I live with Cathy.



BETTY

I would have been frightened when I was your age. I thought, the poor children, their mother all alone.



LIN

I’ve a lot of friends.



BETTY

I find when I’m making tea I put out two cups. It’s strange not having a man in the house. You don’t know who to do things for.



LIN

Yourself.



BETTY

Oh, that’s very selfish.



LIN

Have you any women friends?



BETTY

I’ve never been so short of men’s company that I’ve had to bother with women.



LIN

Don’t you like women?



BETTY

They don’t have such interesting conversations as men. There has never been a woman composer of genius. They don’t have a sense of humour. They spoil things for themselves with their emotions. I can’t say I do like women very much, no.



LIN

But you’re a woman.



BETTY

There’s nothing says you have to like yourself.



LIN

Do you like me?



BETTY

There’s no need to take it personally, Lin.



MARTIN and VICTORIA come back.



MARTIN

Do you know if you put cocaine on your prick you can keep up it all night? The only thing is of course it goes numb so you don’t feel anything. But you would, that’s the main thing. I just want to make you happy.



BETTY

Vicky, I’d like to go home.



VICTORIA

Yes, Mummy, of course.



BETTY

I’m sorry, dear.



VICTORIA

I think Tommy would like to stay out a bit longer.



LIN

Hello, Martin. We do keep out of each other’s way.



MARTIN

I think that’s the best thing to do.



BETTY

Perhaps you’d walk home with me, Martin. I do feel safer with a man. The park is so large the grass seems to tilt.



MARTIN

Yes, I’d like to go home and do some work. I’m writing a novel about women from the women’s point of view.



MARTIN and BETTY go. LIN and VICTORIA are alone. They embrace.



VICTORIA

Why the hell can’t he just be a wife and come with me? Why does Martin make me tie myself in knots? No wonder we can’t just have a simple fuck. No, not Martin, why do I make myself tie myself in knots. It’s got to stop, Lin. I’m not like that with you. Would you love me if I went to Manchester?



LIN

Yes.



VICTORIA

Would you love me if I went on a climbing expedition in the Andes mountains?



LIN

Yes.



VICTORIA

Would you love me if my teeth fell out?



LIN

Yes.



VICTORIA

Would you love me if I loved ten other people?



LIN

And me?



VICTORIA

Yes.



LIN

Yes.



VICTORIA

And I feel apologetic for not being quite so subordinate as I was. I am more intelligent than him. I am brilliant.



LIN

Leave him Vic. Come and live with me.



VICTORIA

Don’t be silly.



LIN

Silly, Christ, don’t then. I’m not asking because I need to live with someone. I’d enjoy it, that’s all, we’d both enjoy it. Fuck you. Cathy, for fuck’s sake – stop throwing stones at the ducks. The man’s going to get you.



VICTORIA

What man? Do you need a man to frighten your child with?



LIN

My mother said it.



VICTORIA

You’re so inconsistent, Lin.



LIN

I’ve changed who I sleep with, I can’t change everything.



VICTORIA

Like when I had to stop you getting a job in a boutique and collaborating with sexist consumerism.



LIN

I should have got that job, Cathy would have liked it. Why shouldn’t I have some decent clothes? I’m sick of dressing like a boy, why can’t I look sexy, wouldn’t you love me?



VICTORIA

Lin, you’ve no analysis.



LIN

No but I’m good at kissing aren’t I? I give Cathy guns, my mum didn’t give me guns. I dress her in jeans, she wants to wear dresses. I don’t know. I can’t work it out. I don’t want to. You read too many books, you get at me all the time, you’re worse to me than Martin is to you, you piss me off, my brother’s been killed. I’m sorry to win the argument that way but there it is.



VICTORIA

What do you mean win the argument?



LIN

I mean be nice to me.



VICTORIA

In Belfast?



LIN

I heard this morning. Don’t don’t start. I’ve hardly seen him for two years. I rung my father. You’d think I shot him myself. He doesn’t want me to go to the funeral.



CATHY approaches.



VICTORIA

What will you do?



LIN

Go of course.



CATHY

What is it? Who’s killed? What?



LIN

It’s Bill. Your uncle. In the army. Bill that gave you the blue teddy.



CATHY

Can I have his gun?



LIN

It’s time we went home. Time you went to bed.



CATHY

No it’s not.



LIN

We go home and you have tea and you have a bath and you go to bed.



CATHY

Fuck off.



LIN

Cathy, shut up.



VICTORIA

It’s only half past five, why don’t we –



LIN

I’ll tell you why she has to go to bed –



VICTORIA

She can come home with me.



LIN

Because I want her out the fucking way.



VICTORIA

She can come home with me.



CATHY

I’m not going to bed.



LIN

I want her home with me not home with you, I want her in bed, I want today over.



CATHY

I’m not going to bed.



LIN hits CATHY, CATHY cries.



LIN

And shut up or I’ll give you something to cry for.



CATHY

I’m not going to bed.



VICTORIA

Cathy –



LIN

You keep out of it.



VICTORIA

Lin for God’s sake.



They are all shouting. CATHY runs off. LIN and VICTORIA are silent. Then they laugh and embrace.



LIN

Where’s Tommy?



VICTORIA

What? Didn’t he go with Martin?



LIN

Did he?



VICTORIA

God oh God.



LIN

Cathy! Cathy!



VICTORIA

I haven’t thought about him. How could I not think about him? Tommy!



LIN

Cathy! Come on, quick, I want some help.



VICTORIA

Tommy! Tommy!



CATHY comes back.



LIN

Where’s Tommy? Have you seen him? Did he go with Martin? Do you know where he is?



CATHY

I showed him the goose. We went in the bushes.



LIN

Then what?



CATHY

I came back on the swing.



VICTORIA

And Tommy? Where was Tommy?



CATHY

He fed the ducks.



LIN

No that was before.



CATHY

He did a pee in the bushes. I helped him with his trousers.



VICTORIA

And after that?



CATHY

He fed the ducks.



VICTORIA

No no.



CATHY

He liked the ducks. I expect he fell in.



LIN

Did you see him fall in?



VICTORIA

Tommy! Tommy!



LIN

What’s the last time you saw him?



CATHY

He did a pee.



VICTORIA

Mummy said he would fall in. Oh God, Tommy!



LIN

We’ll go round the pond. We’ll go opposite ways round the pond.



ALL (shout)

Tommy!



VICTORIA and LIN go off opposite sides. CATHY climbs the bench.



CATHY

Georgie Best superstar



Walks like a woman and wears a bra.



There he is! I see him! Mum! Vicky! There he is!



He’s in the bushes.



LIN comes back.



LIN

Come on Cathy love, let’s go home.



CATHY

Vicky’s got him.



LIN

Come on.



CATHY

Is she cross?



LIN

No. Come on.



CATHY

I found him.



LIN

Yes. Come on.



CATHY gets off the bench. CATHY and LIN hug.



CATHY

I’m watching telly.



LIN

OK.



CATHY

After the news.



LIN

OK.



CATHY

I’m not going to bed.



LIN

Yes you are.



CATHY

I’m not going to bed now.



LIN

Not now but early.



CATHY

How early?



LIN

Not late.



CATHY

How not late?



LIN

Early.



CATHY

How early?



LIN

Not late.



They go off together. GERRY comes on. He waits. EDWARD comes.



EDWARD

I’ve got some fish for dinner. I thought I’d make a cheese sauce.



GERRY

I won’t be in.



EDWARD

Where are you going?



GERRY

For a start I’m going to a sauna. Then I’ll see.



EDWARD

All right. What time will you be back? We’ll eat then.



GERRY

You’re getting like a wife.



EDWARD

I don’t mind that.



GERRY

Why don’t I do the cooking some time?



EDWARD

You can if you like. You’re just not as good at it that’s all. Do it tonight.



GERRY

I won’t be in tonight.



EDWARD

Do it tomorrow. If we can’t eat it we can always go to a restaurant.



GERRY

Stop it.



EDWARD

Stop what?



GERRY

Just be yourself.



EDWARD

I don’t know what you mean. Everyone’s always tried to stop me being feminine and now you are too.



GERRY

You’re putting it on.



EDWARD

I like doing the cooking. I like being fucked. You do like me like this really.



GERRY

I’m bored, Eddy.



EDWARD

Go to the sauna.



GERRY

And you’ll stay home and wait up for me.



EDWARD

No, I’ll go to bed and read a book.



GERRY

Or knit. You could knit me a pair of socks.



EDWARD

I might knit. I like knitting.



GERRY

I don’t mind if you knit. I don’t want to be married.



EDWARD

I do.



GERRY

Well I’m divorcing you.



EDWARD

I wouldn’t want to keep a man who wants his freedom.



GERRY

Eddy, do stop playing the injured wife, it’s not funny.



EDWARD

I’m not playing. It’s true.



GERRY

I’m not the husband so you can’t be the wife.



EDWARD

I’ll always be here, Gerry, if you want to come back. I know you men like to go off by yourselves. I don’t think I could love deeply more than once. But I don’t think I can face life on my own so don’t leave it too long or it may be too late.



GERRY

What are you trying to turn me into?



EDWARD

A monster, darling, which is what you are.



GERRY

I’ll collect my stuff from the flat in the morning.



GERRY goes. EDWARD sits on the bench. It gets darker. VICTORIA comes.



VICTORIA

Tommy dropped a toy car somewhere, you haven’t seen it? It’s red. He says it’s his best one. Oh the hell with it. Martin’s reading him a story. There, isn’t it quiet?



They sit on the bench, holding hands.



EDWARD

I like women.



VICTORIA

That should please Mother.



EDWARD

No listen Vicky. I’d rather be a woman. I wish I had breasts like that, I think they’re beautiful. Can I touch them?



VICTORIA

What, pretending they’re yours?



EDWARD

No, I know it’s you.



VICTORIA

I think I should warn you I’m enjoying this.



EDWARD

I’m sick of men.



VICTORIA

I’m sick of men.



EDWARD

I think I’m a lesbian.




Scene Three

The park. Summer night. VICTORIA, LIN and EDWARD drunk.

LIN

Where are you?



VICTORIA

Come on.



EDWARD

Do we sit in a circle?



VICTORIA

Sit in a triangle.



EDWARD

You’re good at mathematics. She’s good at mathematics.



VICTORIA

Give me your hand. We all hold hands.



EDWARD

Do you know what to do?



LIN

She’s making it up.



VICTORIA

We start off by being quiet.



EDWARD

What?



LIN

Hush.



EDWARD

Will something appear?



VICTORIA

It was your idea.



EDWARD

It wasn’t my idea. It was your book.



LIN

You said call up the goddess.



EDWARD

I don’t remember saying that.



LIN

We could have called her on the telephone.



EDWARD

Don’t be so silly, this is meant to be frightening.



LIN

Kiss me.



VICTORIA

Are we going to do it?



LIN

We’re doing it.



VICTORIA

A ceremony.



LIN

It’s very sexy, you said it is. You said the women were priests in the temples and fucked all the time. I’m just helping.



VICTORIA

As long as it’s sacred.



LIN

It’s very sacred.



VICTORIA

Innin, Innana, Nana, Nut, Anat, Anahita, Istar, Isis.



LIN

I can’t remember all that.



VICTORIA

Lin! Innin, Innana, Nana, Nut, Anat, Anahita, Istar, Isis.



LIN and EDWARD join in and continue the chant under VICTORIA’s speech.



Goddess of many names, oldest of the old, who walked in chaos and created life, hear us calling you back through time, before Jehovah, before Christ, before men drove you out and burnt your temples, hear us, Lady, give us back what we were, give us the history we haven’t had, make us the women we can’t be.



ALL

Innin, Innana, Nana, Nut, Anat, Anahita, Istar, Isis.



Chant continues under other speeches.



LIN

Come back, goddess.



VICTORIA

Goddess of the sun and the moon her brother, little goddess of Crete with snakes in your hands.



LIN

Goddess of breasts.



VICTORIA

Goddess of cunts.



LIN

Goddess of fat bellies and babies. And blood blood blood.



Chant continues.



I see her.



EDWARD

What?



They stop chanting.



LIN

I see her. Very tall. Snakes in her hands. Light light light – look out! Did I give you a fright?



EDWARD

I was terrified.



VICTORIA

Don’t spoil it Lin.



LIN

It’s all out of a book.



VICTORIA

Innin Innana – I can’t do it now. I was really enjoying myself.



LIN

She won’t appear with a man here.



VICTORIA

They had men, they had sons and lovers.



EDWARD

They had eunuchs.



LIN

Don’t give us ideas.



VICTORIA

There’s Attis and Tammuz, they’re torn to pieces.



EDWARD

Tear me to pieces, Lin.



VICTORIA

The priestess chose a lover for a year and he was king because she chose him and then he was killed at the end of the year.



EDWARD

Hurray.



VICTORIA

And the women had the children and nobody knew it was done by fucking so they didn’t know about their fathers and nobody cared who the father was and the property was passed down through the maternal line –



LIN

Don’t turn it into a lecture, Vicky, it’s meant to be an orgy.



VICTORIA

It never hurts to understand the theoretical background. You can’t separate fucking and economics.



LIN

Give us a kiss.



EDWARD

Shut up, listen.



LIN

What?



EDWARD

There’s somebody there.



LIN

Where?



EDWARD

There.



VICTORIA

The priestesses used to make love to total strangers.



LIN

Go on then, I dare you.



EDWARD

Go on, Vicky.



VICTORIA

He won’t know it’s a sacred rite in honour of the goddess.



EDWARD

We’ll know.



LIN

We can tell him.



EDWARD

It’s not what he thinks, it’s what we think.



LIN

Don’t tell him till after, he’ll run a mile.



VICTORIA

Hello. We’re having an orgy. Do you want me to suck your cock?



The stranger approaches. It is MARTIN.



MARTIN

There you are. I’ve been looking everywhere. What the hell are you doing. Do you know what the time is? You’re all pissed out of your minds.



They leap on MARTIN, and pull him down and start to make love to him.



Well that’s all right. If all we’re talking about is having a lot of sex there’s no problem. I was all for the sixties when liberation just meant fucking.Another stranger approaches.



LIN

Hey you, come here. Come and have sex with us.



VICTORIA

Who is it?



The stranger is a SOLDIER.



LIN

It’s my brother.



EDWARD

Lin, don’t.



LIN

It’s my brother.



VICTORIA

It’s her sense of humour, you get used to it.



LIN

Shut up Vicky, it’s my brother. Isn’t it? Bill?



SOLDIER

Yes it’s me.



LIN

And you are dead.



SOLDIER

Fucking dead all right yeah.



LIN

Have you come back to tell us something?



SOLDIER

No I’ve come for a fuck. That was the worst thing in the fucking army. Never fucking let out. Can’t fucking talk to Irish girls. Fucking bored out of my fucking head. That or shit scared. For five minutes I’d be glad I wasn’t bored, then I was fucking scared. Then we’d come in and I’d be glad I wasn’t scared and then I was fucking bored. Spend the day reading fucking porn and the fucking night wanking. Man’s fucking life in the fucking army? No fun when the fucking kids hate you. I got so I fucking wanted to kill someone and I got fucking killed myself and I want a fuck.



LIN

I miss you. Bill. Bill.



LIN collapses. SOLDIER goes. VICTORIA comforts LIN.



EDWARD

Let’s go home.



LIN

Victoria, come home with us. Victoria’s coming to live with me and Edward.



MARTIN

Tell me about it in the morning.



LIN

It’s true.



VICTORIA

It is true.



MARTIN

Tell me when you’re sober.



EDWARD, LIN, VICTORIA go off together. MARTIN goes off alone. GERRY comes on.



GERRY

I come here sometimes at night and pick somebody up. Sometimes I come here at night and don’t pick anybody up. I do also enjoy walking about at night. There’s never any trouble finding someone. I can have sex any time. You might not find the type you most fancy every day of the week, but there’s plenty of people about who just enjoy having a good time. I quite like living alone. If I live with someone I get annoyed with them. Edward always put on Capital Radio when he got up. The silence gets wasted. I wake up at four o’clock sometimes. Birds. Silence. If I bring somebody home I never let them stay the night. Edward! Edward!



EDWARD from Act One comes on.



EDWARD

Gerry, I love you.



GERRY

Yes, I know. I love you, too.



EDWARD

You know what we did? I want to do it again. I think about it all the time. Don’t you want to any more?



GERRY

Yes, of course.



ALL (sing ‘Cloud Nine’).



It’ll be fine when you reach Cloud Nine.



Mist was rising and the night was dark.



Me and my baby took a walk in the park.



He said Be mine and you’re on Cloud Nine.



Better watch out when you’re on Cloud Nine.



Smoked some dope on the playground swings



Higher and higher on true love’s wings



He said Be mine and you’re on Cloud Nine.



Twenty-five years on the same Cloud Nine.



Who did she meet on her first blind date?



The guys were no surprise but the lady was great



They were women in love, they were on Cloud Nine.



Two the same, they were on Cloud Nine.



The bride was sixty-five, the groom was seventeen,



They fucked in the back of the black limousine.



It was divine in the silver Cloud Nine.



Simply divine in their silver Cloud Nine.



The wife’s lover’s children and my lover’s wife,



Cooking in my kitchen, confusing my life.



And it’s upside down when you reach Cloud Nine.



Upside down when you reach Cloud Nine.




Scene Four

The park. Afternoon in late summer. MARTIN, CATHY, EDWARD.

CATHY

Under the bramble bushes,



Under the sea boom boom boom,



True love for you my darling,



True love for me my darling,



When we are married,



We’ll raise a family.



Boy for you, girl for me,



Boom tiddley oom boom.



SEXY.



EDWARD

You’ll have Tommy and Cathy tonight then OK? Tommy’s still on antibiotics, do make him finish the bottle, he takes it in Ribena. It’s no good in orange, he spits it out. Remind me to give you Cathy’s swimming things.



CATHY

I did six strokes, didn’t I Martin? Did I do a width? How many strokes is a length? How many miles is a swimming pool? I’m going to take my bronze and silver and gold and diamond.



MARTIN

Is Tommy still wetting the bed?



EDWARD

Don’t get angry with him about it.



MARTIN

I just need to go to the launderette so I’ve got a spare sheet. Of course I don’t get fucking angry, Eddy, for God’s sake. I don’t like to say he is my son but he is my son. I’m surprised I’m not wetting the bed myself.



CATHY

I don’t wet the bed ever. Do you wet the bed Martin?



MARTIN

No.



CATHY

You said you did.



BETTY comes.



BETTY

I do miss the sun living in England but today couldn’t be more beautiful. You appreciate the weekend when you’re working. Betty’s been at work this week, Cathy. It’s terribly tiring, Martin, I don’t know how you’ve done it all these years. And the money, I feel like a child with money, Clive always paid everything but I do understand it perfectly well. Look, Cathy, let me show you my money.



CATHY

I’ll count it. Let me count it. What’s that?



BETTY

Five pounds. Five and five is –?



CATHY

One two three –



BETTY

Five and five is ten, and five –



CATHY

If I get it right can I have one?



EDWARD

No you can’t.



CATHY goes on counting the money.



BETTY

I never like to say anything, Martin, or you’ll think I’m being a mother-in-law.



EDWARD

Which you are.



BETTY

Thank you, Edward, I’m not talking to you. Martin, I think you’re being wonderful. Vicky will come back. Just let her stay with Lin till she sorts herself out. It’s very nice for a girl to have a friend, I had friends at school, that was very nice. But I’m sure Lin and Edward don’t want her with them all the time. I’m not at all shocked that Lin and Edward aren’t married and she already has a child, we all know first marriages don’t always work out. But really Vicky must be in the way. And poor little Tommy. I hear he doesn’t sleep properly and he’s had a cough.



MARTIN

No, he’s fine, Betty, thank you.



CATHY

My bed’s horrible. I want to sleep in the big bed with Lin and Vicky and Eddy and I do get in if I’ve got a bad dream, and my bed’s got a bump right in my back. I want to sleep in a tent.



BETTY

Well Tommy has got a nasty cough, Martin, whatever you say.



EDWARD

He’s over that. He’s got some medicine.



MARTIN

He takes it in Ribena.



BETTY

Well I’m glad to hear it. Look what a lot of money, Cathy, and I sit behind a desk on my own and I answer the telephone and keep the doctor’s appointment book and it really is great fun.



CATHY

Can we go camping, Martin, in a tent? We could take the Dead Hand Gang.



BETTY

Not those big boys, Cathy? They’re far too big and rough for you. They climb back into the park after dark. I’m sure Mummy doesn’t let you play with them, does she Edward? Well I don’t know.



Ice-cream bells.



CATHY

Ice cream. Martin you promised. I’ll have a double ninety-nine. No I’ll have a shandy lolly. Betty, you have a shandy lolly and I’ll have a lick. No, you have a double ninety-nine and I’ll have the chocolate.



MARTIN, CATHY and BETTY go, leaving EDWARD. GERRY comes.



GERRY

Hello, Eddy. Thought I might find you here.



EDWARD

Gerry.



GERRY

Not working today then?



EDWARD

I don’t work here any more.



GERRY

Your mum got you into a dark suit?



EDWARD

No of course not. I’m on the dole. I am working, though, I do housework.



GERRY

Whose wife are you now then?



EDWARD

Nobody’s. I don’t think like that any more. I’m living with some women.



GERRY

What women?



EDWARD

It’s my sister, Vic, and her lover. They go out to work and I look after the kids.



GERRY

I thought for a moment you said you were living with women.



EDWARD

We do sleep together, yes.



GERRY

I was passing the park anyway so I thought I’d look in. I was in the sauna the other night and I saw someone who looked like you but it wasn’t. I had sex with him anyway.



EDWARD

I do go to the sauna sometimes.



CATHY comes, gives EDWARD an ice cream, goes.



GERRY

I don’t think I’d like living with children. They make a lot of noise don’t they?



EDWARD

I tell them to shut up and they shut up. I wouldn’t want to leave them at the moment.



GERRY

Look why don’t we go for a meal some time?



EDWARD

Yes I’d like that. Where are you living now?



GERRY

Same place.



EDWARD

I’ll come round for you tomorrow night about 7.30.



GERRY

Great.



EDWARD goes. HARRY comes. HARRY and GERRY pick each other up. They go off. BETTY comes back.



BETTY

No, the ice cream was my treat, Martin. Off you go. I’m going to have a quiet sit in the sun.



MAUD comes.



MAUD

Let Mrs Saunders be a warning to you, Betty. I know what it is to be unprotected.



BETTY

But Mother, I have a job. I earn money.



MAUD

I know we have our little differences but I always want what is best for you.



ELLEN comes.



ELLEN

Betty, what happens with a man?



BETTY

You just keep still.



ELLEN

And is it enjoyable? Don’t forget me, Betty.



MAUD and ELLEN go.



BETTY

I used to think Clive was the one who liked sex. But then I found I missed it. I used to touch myself when I was very little, I thought I’d invented something wonderful. I used to do it to go to sleep with or to cheer myself up, and one day it was raining and I was under the kitchen table, and my mother saw me with my hand under my dress rubbing away, and she dragged me out so quickly I hit my head and it bled and I was sick, and nothing was said, and I never did it again till this year. I thought if Clive wasn’t looking at me there wasn’t a person there. And one night in bed in my flat I was so frightened I started touching myself. I thought my hand might go through into space. I touched my face, it was there, my arm, my breast, and my hand went down where I thought it shouldn’t, and I thought well there is somebody there. It felt very sweet, it was a feeling from very long ago, it was very soft, just barely touching, and I felt myself gathering together more and more and I felt angry with Clive and angry with my mother and I went on and on defying them, and there was this vast feeling growing in me and all round me and they couldn’t stop me and no one could stop me and I was there and coming and coming. Afterwards I thought I’d betrayed Clive. My mother would kill me. But I felt triumphant because I was a separate person from them. And I cried because I didn’t want to be. But I don’t cry about it any more. Sometimes I do it three times in one night and it really is great fun.



VICTORIA and LIN come in.



VICTORIA

So I said to the professor, I don’t think this is an occasion for invoking the concept of structural causality – oh hello Mummy.



BETTY

I’m going to ask you a question, both of you. I have a little money from your grandmother. And the three of you are living in that tiny flat with two children. I wonder if we could get a house and all live in it together? It would give you more room.



VICTORIA

But I’m going to Manchester anyway.



LIN

We’d have a garden, Vicky.



BETTY

You do seem to have such fun all of you.



VICTORIA

I don’t want to.



BETTY

I didn’t think you would.



LIN

Come on, Vicky, she knows we sleep together, and Eddy.



BETTY

I think I’ve known for quite a while but I’m not sure. I don’t usually think about it, so I don’t know if I know about it or not.



VICTORIA

I don’t want to live with my mother.



LIN

Don’t think of her as your mother, think of her as Betty.



VICTORIA

But she thinks of herself as my mother.



BETTY

I am your mother.



VICTORIA

But Mummy we don’t even like each other.



BETTY

We might begin to.



CATHY comes on howling with a nosebleed.



LIN

Oh Cathy what happened?



BETTY

She’s been assaulted.



VICTORIA

It’s a nosebleed.



CATHY

Took my ice cream.



LIN

Who did?



CATHY

Took my money.



MARTIN comes.



MARTIN

Is everything all right?



LIN

I thought you were looking after her.



CATHY

They hit me. I can’t play. They said I’m a girl.



BETTY

Those dreadful boys, the gang, the Dead Hand.



MARTIN

What do you mean you thought I was looking after her?



LIN

Last I saw her she was with you getting an ice cream. It’s your afternoon.



MARTIN

Then she went off to play. She goes off to play. You don’t keep an eye on her every minute.



LIN

She doesn’t get beaten up when I’m looking after her.



CATHY

Took my money.



MARTIN

Why the hell should I look after your child anyway? I just want Tommy. Why should he live with you and Vicky all week?



LIN

I don’t mind if you don’t want to look after her but don’t say you will and then this happens.



VICTORIA

When I get to Manchester everything’s going to be different anyway, Lin’s staying here, and you’re staying here, we’re all going to have to sit down and talk it through.



MARTIN

I’d really enjoy that.



CATHY

Hit me on the face.



LIN

You were the one looking after her and look at her now, that’s all.



MARTIN

I’ve had enough of you telling me.



LIN

Yes you know it all.



MARTIN

Now stop it. I work very hard at not being like this, I could do with some credit.



LIN

OK you’re quite nice, try and enjoy it. Don’t make me sorry for you, Martin, it’s hard for me too. We’ve better things to do than quarrel. I’ve got to go and sort those little bastards out for a start. Where are they, Cathy?



CATHY

Don’t kill them, Mum, hit them. Give them a nosebleed, Mum.



LIN goes.



VICTORIA

Tommy’s asleep in the pushchair. We’d better wake him up or he won’t sleep tonight.



MARTIN

Sometimes I keep him up watching television till he falls asleep on the sofa so I can hold him. Come on, Cathy, we’ll get another ice cream.



CATHY

Chocolate sauce and nuts.



VICTORIA

Betty, would you like an ice cream?



BETTY

No thank you, the cold hurts my teeth, but what a nice thought, Vicky, thank you.



VICTORIA goes. BETTY alone. GERRY comes.



I think you used to be Edward’s flatmate.



GERRY

You’re his mother. He’s talked about you.



BETTY

Well never mind children are always wrong about their parents. It’s a great problem knowing where to live and who to share with. I live by myself just now.



GERRY

Good, so do I. You can do what you like.



BETTY

I don’t really know what I like.



GERRY

You’ll soon find out.



BETTY

What do you like?



GERRY

Waking up at four in the morning.



BETTY

I like listening to music in bed and sometimes for supper I just have a big piece of bread and dip it in very hot lime pickle. So you don’t get lonely by yourself? Perhaps you have a lot of visitors. I’ve been thinking I should have some visitors, I could give a little dinner party. Would you come? There wouldn’t just be bread and lime pickle.



GERRY

Thank you very much.



BETTY

Or don’t wait to be asked to dinner. Just drop in informally. I’ll give you the address shall I? I don’t usually give strange men my address but then you’re not a strange man, you’re a friend of Edward’s. I suppose I seem a different generation to you but you are older than Edward. I was married for so many years it’s quite hard to know how to get acquainted. But if there isn’t a right way to do things you have to invent one. I always thought my mother was far too old to be attractive but when you get to an age yourself it feels quite different.



GERRY

I think you could be quite attractive.



BETTY

If what?



GERRY

If you stop worrying.



BETTY

I think when I do more about things I worry about them less. So perhaps you could help me do more.



GERRY

I might be going to live with Edward again.



BETTY

That’s nice, but I’m rather surprised if he wants to share a flat. He’s rather involved with a young woman he lives with, or two young women, I don’t understand Edward but never mind.



GERRY

I’m very involved with him.



BETTY

I think Edward did try to tell me once but I didn’t listen. So what I’m being told now is that Edward is ‘gay’ is that right? And you are too. And I’ve been making rather a fool of myself. But Edward does also sleep with women.



GERRY

He does, yes, I don’t.



BETTY

Well people always say it’s the mother’s fault but I don’t intend to start blaming myself. He seems perfectly happy.



GERRY

I could still come and see you.



BETTY

So you could, yes. I’d like that. I’ve never tried to pick up a man before.



GERRY

Not everyone’s gay.



BETTY

No, that’s lucky isn’t it.



GERRY goes. CLIVE comes.



CLIVE

You are not that sort of woman, Betty. I can’t believe you are. I can’t feel the same about you as I did. And Africa is to be Communist I suppose. I used to be proud to be British. There was a high ideal. I came out onto the verandah and looked at the stars.



CLIVE goes. BETTY from Act One comes. BETTY and BETTY embrace.
