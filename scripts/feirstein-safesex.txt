MANNY

Talk.

(jake stops and looks back)

JAKE

You say something?

What're you doing?

MANNY

Praying for sex.

JAKE
Praying?

MANNY
Uh huh.

JAKE
For sex?

MANNY
Uh huh.

JAKE

Your prayers have been answered.

MANNY

I don't want your money.

JAKE

I didn't offer any.

MANNY

I don't want anything from you.

JAKE

And that's what you'll get.

MANNY

You can't promise that. You don't know.

JAKE

I know what I'm willing to give.

MANNY

I know what I'm willing to give. But I can't promise.

JAKE

I can.

MANNY

Not for sure. You don't know.


JAKE

I know.

MANNY

Not for sure. And I need for sure.


JAKE
So, you wanna do it or what?

MANNY
Can you kiss?

JAKE
I can't recall any complaints.

MANNY
TALK!

JAKE
What!?

MANNY
CAN. YOU. KISS?

JAKE

Yeah. Alright? Yeah, I can kiss.

MANNY
Go away.

JAKE

What the hell's so important about kissing all of a sudden?

MANNY

Because you can't.

JAKE

Says you.

MANNY

I'm not giving you anything.

JAKE

I wouldn't take anything from you.

MANNY

You could take it. But you couldn't take it away. I need someone to take it away.

JAKE

So, you wanna do it or what?

MANNY

Do I inspire you to lust?

JAKE

You fishing?

MANNY

Baiting.

JAKE

What if I said yes?



MANNY

I'd have to say no.

JAKE

What do you want?

MANNY

What are you offering?

JAKE

A good time.

MANNY

That's all?

JAKE

What else do you want?

MANNY

Nothing.

JAKE

Great. You got it.

MANNY

You can't be sure.

JAKE

I'm sure, goddamnit!

MANNY

I meant what I said.


JAKE
Yeah? Well, me too.

MANNY

What'd you say?

JAKE

What'd you say?

MANNY

You can't kiss.

JAKE

Says you.


MANNY

I want you.


MANNY

You're very beautiful.

(jake turns back toward manny)

MANNY

But I can't kiss.


MANNY

Two men meet in a bar and go home together. They have a drink, lower the lights, climb into bed, and they kiss.

Two grown men, mutually attracted, mutually in need, both of them hoping that this will be more than just another night.

Two grown men lie next to each other, facing each other, cheeks pressed flat to pillows, palms pressed to the mattress, knees firmly planted, thighs comfortably parted, rears raised high and waiting. Two grown men wait next to each other equally willing, equally wanting, equally wishing to please. And they wait. Each waiting for the other to take. Each wanting only to give. And they wait. And they crumble. And they part. No one giving. No one getting. No one taking.

Safe.

Safe.

Unhappy but safe.

I wonder if you could understand how desperately I want to be with you.

JAKE

With me?

MANNY

No other.



JAKE

How far do you live?

MANNY

I've slept with thousands of men.

JAKE

We'll go to my place.

MANNY

I can't go anywhere.

JAKE

Come on.

MANNY

I can't see anyone.

JAKE

This way.

MANNY

I can't even kiss.

JAKE

Have you got it?


JAKE

Are you sick?

MANNY

What? No.


JAKE

No?

MANNY

No. You?

JAKE

Me? No. So? Let's go.

MANNY

Two grown men stand in a bar. Watching. Each other. They stare at each other. Each wanting the other. Two grown men stare in a bar, feet apart, eyes together, they stare. They sip. They puff. They want. Two grown men stare in a bar and then travel on in opposite directions. Never touching. Never holding. Never having. And why? Why? They can't kiss. They want to. They used to. They can't anymore.

A moment of silence for what we used to do and how it felt.


JAKE

It's alright. I washed it this morning. Hot water. And bleach.

MANNY

Thank you.

JAKE

You're welcome.

MANNY

I feel better.

JAKE

I wasn't thinking.

MANNY

I was.

JAKE

Sometimes I forget.

MANNY

I try to.

JAKE

But you don't have it.

MANNY

No.


JAKE

And I don't have it.

MANNY

So? So . . .

JAKE

MANNY

Two grown men stand in a bar looking at each other. Four grown men stand in a bar looking at each other. Eight grown men stand in a bar looking at each other. Twelve grown men stand in a bar looking at each other. Do they have it? Do they think? Do they forget? Can they kiss?

Nine grown men stand in a bar looking at each other. Five grown men stand in a bar looking at each other. One grown man stands in a bar looking for someone to look at.


MANNY

Don't drag your Ex's into this.

JAKE

They're yours.

MANNY

No more. Please.

MANNY

I never wanted this. And I've always known what I wanted. Done what I wanted. And never shunned the responsibility of my actions. But not this. Not this.

JAKE

May I sit down?

MANNY

Please.


MANNY

At fourteen years old I had a goal. A path. A vision all my own. At fourteen years old I could see my destiny so clearly that I could almost reach out with my bare hands and pull myself along the vortex of time. Impressed?

MANNY

Want to know my goal?

JAKE

May I lie down?

MANNY

Please.

JAKE

Ready.

MANNY

My goal was to lie in the arms of every man. Every man.

JAKE

Every man.

MANNY

To lie in the arms of every man.

JAKE

Pet me.


MANNY

Every man.

JAKE

Every man.

MANNY

I never wanted anyone to wait. I never asked names. I offered a basic service; a barter, if you will. All up front. All explained. No small print. All understood. Your body for mine. Your moment for mine. Your knowledge, technique, history, scars . . . Your faults and shortcomings, your talents and abundances . . . No man too old. No face too deformed, weathered or nubile, ethnic or cliche . . . No form too bizarre; pumped up, stretched out, anorectic or bloated. Closet cases and radicals, perfect tens and amputees . . . No advance too frivolous. No come-on waylaid. Want me? Take me. Be gentle. Be rough. Be generous. Be selfish. Go ahead; have a ball. Enjoy yourself. That's why I'm here. That's what I'm going to do.

JAKE

Me too.

MANNY

Satisfaction was my aim. Mine and theirs. Separation was my only rule. My rule. I'm here now. Take. Be. Here. One minute. One hour. One day. Week. As long as the moment lasted. As long or as short as it took to end. But an end, even a pause, was the end. No pleading.

No excuses accepted. No arguments entertained. Understand and step aside. Say, "Thanks," and "Goodbye."

My goal: Every man. My rule. My law. No repeats. No attachments.

And I loved them all. And I missed them when they were gone. Done. Some more than others. And I was tempted to let them stay. Tempted to be tempted to stay. It would have been so easy so many times. So many Mr. Rights. So many comfortable beds. And lives. So many with so much to offer. Wealth, art, travel, danger ... So much love, need, comfort . . . And the good-byes. And the tears. And the smiles. Sweet morning kisses and rumpled sheets. Warm beds and spring breezes. Morning chills by spent fireplaces. Crisp cotton sheets in air-conditioned suites. Damp sleeping bags on forest leaves. Car seats. Theater balconies. Park benches. And coffee. Oh, the coffee. Coffee and goodbyes . . . Off-to-work good-byes. Off-to-shop goodbyes. Going home. Going on. Good-byes. So many lives. So many ways to live. So many men.

JAKE

Don't stop.

MANNY

That's all.

JAKE

What about them?



MANNY

There are more.

JAKE

They look happy. Satisfied.

MANNY

That's funny. Do they?

JAKE

What about us?

MANNY

We're doing all we can.

JAKE

We have our problems.

MANNY

As to be expected.

JAKE

I want more.

MANNY

Two grown men stand in a bar. They look. They touch. They take. Two grown men forget. Want to forget. And they go together. One gives. One gets. One gets what the other does not intend to give. Doesn't even know he's giving. Doesn't even know he had it to give. Doesn't even have it himself. But can give. Two grown men take. One gives. One gets. One weakens and dies.

I didn't know.

JAKE

I believe you.

MANNY

I never wanted this.

JAKE

You have it.

MANNY

No, I give it. I give and give and give . .

JAKE

What if I'm willing to take the risk?

MANNY

There's no risk. There's no question.

JAKE

You don't know.

MANNY

Ask them.

JAKE

But you didn't know then. Now you do.

MANNY

Now I do. So, now I don't.



JAKE

There are ways around it. Things you can still do.

MANNY

Omissions.

JAKE

Precautions to take.

MANNY

Deletions.

JAKE

Alternate activities.

MANNY
Bastardizations.

JAKE

Positive, health-conscious acts of love and fulfillment.

MANNY

Can you kiss?


MANNY

A moment of silence for what can't be done. Another for what can't be undone. A moment of silence for letting go of dreams. And one for stifled lives. For loss. For want. And a toast to those who can change. Who have changed. Who want to change and not forget.



JAKE

Come home with me.

I'm not scared. I know what I'm doing.

MANNY

You don't know anything. One moment of passion, one lapse of concentration, a second out of consciousness, an instant of ecstasy and it's done.

JAKE

No one knows for sure.

MANNY

Doesn't matter. I'm done.

JAKE

We'll be careful.

MANNY

We can't kiss.

JAKE

I don't care.

MANNY

I do!

JAKE

You shouldn't be alone.


MANNY

But I am.

JAKE

People shouldn't be alone.

MANNY

I'm not people anymore. I'm not even a disease. I'm a carrier of a disease. Another body in a hospital waiting room. Not a patient. Not a survivor. A fact. A statistic. No will. No dream. No choice.


JAKE

I'm sorry.

MANNY

Thank you.

JAKE

Well, I guess I'd better move on.

MANNY

Good-bye.

JAKE

What are you going to do?



MANNY

I can't change. I can't. So, I'll sit. And remember. And pray for everything else to change. And when it does (and it will), I'll remember how to kiss.

And I will give only what I choose to give. What I mean to give. What I want to give. And I'll take only what I want from that which is offered. I will give and I will take without fear of small print or hidden clauses.

And I will kiss . . . ! I will kiss having learned nothing.



GHEE

Oh.

MEAD

Hah.

GHEE

Ho.

MEAD

Ah.

GHEE

No.

MEAD

Wha?

GHEE

No.


MEAD

Ya.

GHEE

Oh!

MEAD

Yeah.

GHEE

No!

MEAD

Why?

GHEE

Stop.

MEAD

No!

GHEE

No!

MEAD

Come on.

GHEE

You can't do that.

MEAD

It's alright.

GHEE

It's not.

MEAD

Don't stop.

GHEE

You can't do that.

MEAD

It's alright.

GHEE

It's not on the list.

MEAD

I need you.

GHEE

Check the list.

MEAD

Please.

GHEE

Where's the list?

MEAD

Don't.

GHEE

I'm checking the list.

MEAD

It's alright.

GHEE

Where's the light?

MEAD

Come on.

GHEE

I can't find the light.

MEAD

Come back here.

GHEE

It's not safe. Stop!

Don't touch me.


GHEE

Did you hear what I said?

I'll get the list.

MEAD

Don't bother.

GHEE

I'm sure it wasn't safe.

MEAD

Sure.

GHEE

I'll show you right on the list.

You want to see it on the list?

MEAD

Forget it.

GHEE

'Cause you know I'm right and you know that if I show it to you right on the list in black and white then you'll have to admit that I'm right. Right?

MEAD

Right.


GHEE

You don't believe me. I'll get the list.

MEAD

Forget it. Just forget it. It doesn't matter. It's over.

GHEE

There aren't many things that I know a lot about, but on "Safe Sex" I happen to be an expert.

GHEE

Did you say something?

MEAD

No.

GHEE

I hate when you get like this. Now you're mad at me when all I was trying to do was protect us both. Why can't you stop when I ask you to? Huh? Why does it always have to come to hurt feelings?

MEAD

I'm scared, alright? What's so hard to understand? I'm

GHEE

scared!

GHEE

Being scared is smart. You have to be scared. You're supposed to be scared. You're not normal if you're not scared. Everyone's scared.


GHEE

And I suppose you're not scared?

I'm concerned. You're scared. I'm tired. You're angry.

MEAD

Don't tell me what I am.

GHEE

Don't yell at me.


MEAD

Don't tell me what to do.

GHEE

Don't touch me!


GHEE

The honeymoon is over.

Would you say that was a safe assessment?

GHEE

Lovers for five and a half years, separated for nearly two years, back together for less than a week and already the honeymoon is over.

MEAD

Jerk.

GHEE

Fine. It's all my fault. Dump the blame on me. Like I don't feel guilty enough as is.

MEAD

I said you were a jerk. I wasn't blaming you for being a jerk. I didn't say that being a jerk was your fault. Nor was I attempting to make you feel guilty for being a jerk. I made a simple observation. You're a jerk. Now just drop it.


GHEE

I'm a jerk because in the face of this devastating epidemic I insist we take a few precautions?

MEAD

No. You're just a jerk.

GHEE

Well, that's obvious. Who else but a jerk would want you back? Who else but a jerk would take you back? Who else but a jerk would fall in love with you in the first place?

MEAD

Want to see a list?

MEAD

Damn!

GHEE

Well, come on. I'm waiting. Let's hear the list. How many?

MEAD

You know.

GHEE

No, you see, I only know about your little Larry. But you said that there's a whole list. And much as you cared for him, I'd hardly call little Larry a list.

MEAD

You want to stop?

GHEE

I want to know how many. Larry and who else?

MEAD

Someone else.

GHEE

Who?

MEAD

You wouldn't know them.

GHEE

Them? How many of "them," Casanova?

MEAD

A few. Alright?

GHEE

Fine with me, but I wonder how little Larry felt about your "thems."

MEAD

Once I met Larry there was no one.

GHEE

No one?



MEAD

No one!

He left me. I didn't leave him.

GHEE

And you came crawling back to me.

MEAD

You begged me to come back.

GHEE

I never begged!

MEAD

I never crawled!

MEAD

I hate when you do this! You're not happy unless you've got me bashing your head into a wall.

GHEE

I'm horny.

There's definitely something wrong with me. All I have to do is think about you with someone else and I get crazy. What's that: love?

MEAD

Jealousy.

GHEE

No. You think? No! Well . . . Yeah. Maybe. But if that's jealousy why does everyone put it down?

MEAD

It's an immature emotion. As irrational as it is insulting. It puts an object value on pure emotion and reduces what should be a free partnership into possessor and possessed.

GHEE

I love it.

Whenever I remember your first telling me that you had slept with someone else, all I can think about is the incredible sex we had that night.

I don't remember pain, though I know there was. I don't remember anger, though there certainly was some of that. Just this overwhelming burning that flamed into the most intense passion I had ever felt.

Remember?

MEAD

I remember waiting for you to scream. Guilt. I remember waiting to be punished. Hurt. I remember lying next to you after you'd fallen asleep and thinking about the sex we had just had.

GHEE

It was great, wasn't it?

MEAD

Could have been. That wasn't important. All I remember is that that was the first time you had touched me, let alone made love to me, in over three months.

GHEE

That's a lie.

MEAD

True.

GHEE

It wasn't three months.

GHEE

Maybe three days. Or maybe three weeks.


GHEE

I was scared.

It was a bad time for me. All you read about, every headline, the only thing on TV, was AIDS. Joey had already died. Tommy was in the hospital. And how many other friends did we have who had it? How many others did we think might?

MEAD

So, I got locked out.

GHEE

I was scared.

MEAD

Of what? We'd been together for five years. We'd already done everything they said you shouldn't. If one of us did have it, if one of us was going to infect the other, it was already done.

GHEE

I was in a panic. I wasn't thinking.

MEAD

You were thinking. About yourself.

GHEE

And you. Before we met I was pretty wild. You talk about your lists? Boy if I had to, I don't think I could ever remember all the guys I had sex with.

MEAD

You didn't have sex with anyone. Trust me, I laid next to you all those years. Sex is something you don't have. Oh, you fiddle and diddle, but sex? Real sex?

GHEE

I don't remember getting any complaints.

MEAD

You never hung around long enough to hear them.

GHEE

That's bull.

MEAD

Think so?

GHEE

What about us our first year? We never got out of bed.

MEAD

I don't remember.

GHEE

You couldn't keep your hands off me.

MEAD

That so?

GHEE

I used to have to beg for dinner breaks.

MEAD

That was years ago.

GHEE

Years before AIDS.

MEAD

Our problems started years before AIDS. AIDS was your salvation.

GHEE

That's sick.

MEAD

You ran right out, got your list of Do's and Don'ts and embraced it like a priest takes his vows. Safe Sex, there in black and white you finally had what you always wanted: a concrete, board-certified, actual, purposeful excuse to avoid intimacy. God, you were in your glory! You waved it in my face with one hand and shoved me across the bed with the other. You took your list and nailed it to the headboard like the goddamned sexual commandments: "Thou shalt not . . . Thou shalt not . . . Thou shalt not ..." You're not scared of AIDS, you're scared of sex.

GHEE

Me?

MEAD

Or me. You're scared of sex? You're scared of me.

GHEE

Me scared of you? Don't flatter yourself.

MEAD

When I first started fooling around I reasoned that I was justified. I certainly wasn't getting anything at home. I had a right to look elsewhere. But my lies were so blatant, my excuses so lame ... I wanted you to catch me. I wanted you to know that you could lose, actually lose, me. I did it right under your nose, right in your bed ... I left phone numbers around, and clothing . . . And nothing!

GHEE

I suspected.

MEAD

You hoped. Wished even. One more excuse to push me away.

GHEE

And what were you doing? Your fooling around was supposed to make me feel safer? What are you, out of your mind?

MEAD

Didn't it? You just said that the best sex we ever had was after you found out about Larry. When there actually was danger. When I actually could have been infected.

GHEE

That was different. We had Safe Sex.

MEAD

We had Safe Distance, and that's all you've ever wanted.

GHEE

So what're you saying; that I'm a lousy lay?


GHEE

That your complaint, dearie? That you got stuck with a lukewarm lover? Well, fill your ears with this, buddy: I've got two faucets, hot and cold, and if you were getting lukewarm loving then maybe it's because that's what you dialed.

MEAD

Fine. It's all my fault.

GHEE

Hey, don't try and shut me off. You ran this shower, now stand under it.

So, you laid alone in bed, did ya? You were forced to walk the streets for affection, eh? Let me tell you something, Samantha, you could have had all the sex you wanted. You could've had intimacy pouring out your eyeballs. All you had to do was wash up.

MEAD

Cheese and crackers!

GHEE

Shut up! You had your chance to mouth your neo-Nietzsche nonsense, now it's my turn at bat.

GHEE

You'd come home to me night after night all hot and sweaty from a hard day's work. You'd drift through the door after stopping for a few brews with the boys, reeking of beer, clothes soaked through, hair as greasy as a used-up peanut butter jar, and you'd throw your arms out to me and say, "Baby, I need your lovin'," and expect me to swoon. I swooned alright!

GHEE

I said shut up!

GHEE

Now, I will admit to finding the air pretty sexy for the first year. It was like living in a John Garfield fantasy, my very own hot blue-collared lover leaving armpit stains on my settee; but after a year? But I figured it was a stage, a phase. After all, when we were first dating you'd show up perfectly coiffed and cologned, and it was a chore and challenge to melt you down. But here we were, fairly crossing the threshold, and I'd traded my Arthurian knight in for his white horse.

I will grant you, there are those with penchants for farm follies. I do not, however, happen to march in their number. And I'd say, "Baby, wouldn't you like to clean up first?"

And you'd say, "No."

And I'd say, "Darling, how about we take a shower together?"

And you'd say, "How 'bout we don't?" and laugh a laugh as soiled as your sweat socks.

MEAD

Have you no shame?

GHEE

My sex and sensuality have been attacked. There's no time for illusions. You'd strip down and crawl all filthified into my beautiful crisp clean bed and lie there with a beer in one hand, the remote control in the other, watching some ball game or other . . .

MEAD

I was waiting for you to come to bed, but you were always off somewhere messing around with who knows what.

GHEE

I was throwing in a wash. I was scared what would happen if I left your clothes in the hamper overnight.

MEAD

You really stink.

GHEE

I? I!?!?! Now let's talk about your feet. I've seen dogs fall in love with spots of grass where you'd walked barefoot.

MEAD

Now I've heard everything.

GHEE

Not by a long shot.

MEAD

I showered every morning.

GHEE

You'd never know it at night.

MEAD

If I wash my hair at night it stands up funny in the morning.

Wash it again. I'd be bald! You'd be happy! You'd be happy!

GHEE

And that's bad? You knew how I felt. I told you often enough.


MEAD

You never told me, you nagged.

GHEE

So, you knew. You couldn't make the effort.

MEAD

You're still avoiding the real issue.

GHEE

What's the real issue? That I pushed you away?

MEAD

That you couldn't be with me.

GHEE

I couldn't breathe with you.

MEAD

You're impossible!

GHEE

God, I feel great!

It feels so good to finally get that said.


MEAD

You love the way I smell.

GHEE
That so?

MEAD

You missed me when I wasn't there.

GHEE

Says you.

MEAD

When I'd stay out all night I'd come home and find you in bed with one of my jackets or shirts.

GHEE

Maybe I was cold.


MEAD

Maybe you was gettin' hot. You always smelled of soap. You showered in the morning, showered before bed, showered after sex . . .

GHEE

I was just trying to keep your stink offa me. I was bathing for two.


MEAD

What? Come on, what?

GHEE

Ever notice how pruney my skin was?


MEAD

No. It was soft.

GHEE

My fingertips always looked like something you'd pull out of a box of health-food cereal.


MEAD

Your skin was always cool and lightly moist. I remember powder.

GHEE

I use cornstarch.

MEAD

Silky.

GHEE

Smoother.

MEAD

I'd nustle up against you.

GHEE

Your hands were always dry and rough.

MEAD

I'd pull as close against you as I could.

GHEE

I'd turn my head into the pillow.


MEAD

I couldn't get close enough.

GHEE

I couldn't get far enough away.

MEAD

I rubbed against your back.

GHEE

I'd pull the covers over my head.

MEAD

I kissed your neck.

GHEE

I bit the pillow.

MEAD

I wanted you so badly.

GHEE

Not bad enough to wash!

MEAD

Alright, you win! Let's wash!

GHEE

Now?

MEAD

Together.

GHEE

You mean it?

MEAD

I mean it.


GHEE

I love you.

MEAD

Let's go.

GHEE

But is it safe? I'd better check the list.

What's the big deal? It'll take me two seconds and this way we can be sure.

MEAD

No. No. No. No . . .

GHEE

On second thought I'm sure it's safe. No, it's safe. In fact I'm positive it's safe. As a matter of record it is not only safe but I believe it is highly recommended. It is, as I now recall, the very first rule on the list. The very cornerstone on which Safe Sex is built. So, let's go for it!

GHEE

Okay? Let's go!

GHEE

Alright, we're moving now!

GHEE

Okay. GOWl

GHEE

You okay?

I did this, didn't I?

Whatever happened to sex being fun?

Whatever happened to sex being dirty?

Whatever happened to sex being something we did?

I hope you don't think that I was trying to insult you before. Because I wasn't. Are you insulted?

MEAD

Frustrated.

GHEE

But not insulted.

MEAD

No.

GHEE

Good.

(he lies down flat on his back. Pause) You wanna play Yahtzee?

MEAD

No.

GHEE

C'mon. Let's play a game. How about Monopoly?

MEAD

No.

GHEE

Scrabble?



MEAD

No.

GHEE

Risk!

GHEE

No! I don't want to play Risk.

Can I tell you how I felt about you when we first met? How I felt about us?

MEAD

Be my guest.

GHEE

You won't be insulted.

MEAD

No. Probably just frustrated.

GHEE

Good.

You know that you were my first love. My only love. Except if you count you then and you now. But then you'd have to count me then and me now, so I guess "only" still goes.

You was a baby. I was all growed up. You practically lost your virginity. I'd practically lost count. I tiptoed through your life, living on the edges, covering my tracks, remaining secret and quiet, and was quite happy. They were different times. Is it enough to say that they were different times? I mean, I had a life, you had a life and we had a life. I lived in my world, you lived in your world and then we shared a bed. We had great sex, but argued politics: to be or not to be in the closet, separatism, legalization, legislation . . . Politics were argued, sex was great. Different times.

I believe there were fewer Nautilus machines then. There certainly were fewer gyms. We were certainly happier with ourselves. And we loved each other. We shared what we could when we could and our fear was of them that would not let us be. Our anger was for them that would not let us be. Our comfort was being with each other.

Not so different. But different enough. When I picture you then, I see a man prone in my bed and waiting. No expectations or demands. Just a man, waiting to be with another man, where he was happy and belonged. A nervous smile, an unassumed pose, patient, excited, warm and delicious. And we were together without question. There at that moment, in the present, together. Perfectly balanced: need and satisfaction. Evenly matched. We soared. And sex was unimportant like air and water. We had no lists of Do's and Don'ts. There was no death count. The worst you could get from loving was a broken heart. Which you gave me! And I lived. Remember herpes? Remember crabs? Remember worrying about the clap?

And we were invisible. Nobody knew who we were for sure. We were the great chic mysterious underground and I loved every minute! And then came now.

Different times. Now we enjoy politics and argue sex. Now they know who we are. We're counted in their surveys. We're numbered in their watchfulness. We're powered in their press. We're courted, polled, placated . . . The myths slowly peel away and the mysteries fade. Now they know that we're teachers and doctors and lawyers and priests and mothers and babies. Now they see us everywhere: hospitals, classrooms, theaters, obituaries . . . Now when they tell lies about us we answer back. We've found our voices. We know who we are. They know who we are. And they know that we care what they think.

And all because of a disease. A virus. A virus that you don't get because you're Gay, just because you're human. We were Gay. Now we're human. Y'know, if anyone had ever tried to tell me that one day I would push you across the bed . . . But I did. I did because it wasn't safe for one person to love another person as much as I loved you. And that was thenl (Fondly looking at mead; it is as if they were renewing their wedding vows) Now? I love you more now than I did on our most carefree day. I trust you more now than before you renounced our commitment. I need you more now than when you were away from me. I want you more now . . .

And it's impossible. Even if you fought me and won. Even if you broke through and got me to admit who you truly are to me . . . We can never touch as before. We can never be as before.

"Now" will always define us. Different times. Too late.

At last we have Safe Sex.

GHEE

Safe for them!

I'm angry. I'm frightened. I'm alone.

MEAD

You're not alone.

GHEE

I feel alone.

MEAD

Well, you're not.

GHEE

What're you doing?

MEAD

I love you.

GHEE

I love you too, now sit down.

MEAD

Come on then, get up.

GHEE

You're out of your mind.

MEAD

After five years with you, who wouldn't be. Get up.

GHEE

You're going to kill yourself.

MEAD

What're you, scared?

GHEE

It's not safe.

MEAD

Then check your list first and then get up.

GHEE

For this I don't have to check no list.

MEAD

Then come on.

GHEE

No.

MEAD

You want to be alone the rest of your life? I came back once. Want to bet if I come back again?


GHEE

Can't we shower first?

MEAD

Later. Come on, you're doing great.

GHEE

I'm scared.

MEAD

This is dangerous. You're supposed to be.

MEAD

These are different times with different rules, but some things never change.

GHEE

What are you talking about?

MEAD

Do you trust me?

GHEE

Yes. Can I get down now?

MEAD

Do you believe in me?

GHEE

I told you I did. 60

MEAD

And you believe I love you?

GHEE

Whatever you say.

GHEE

Alright. Yes.

MEAD

Do you believe in miracles?

GHEE

I don't know. I guess so.

GHEE

I love when you take charge.


MEAD

I love you.

GHEE

I love you too.

MEAD

That's all that matters.

MEAD

The rest is a piece of cake.

GHEE

Promise?

MEAD

Promise.

GHEE

Let's shower.



MARION

Jimmy, don't make Mommy crazy, alright? We'll go inside, I'll call Aunt Helen and see if you can go down and play with Robbie.

JIM

Why can't I just go down and ring the bell?

MARION

Because I said so.

(As marion steps into the room she is a struck by some unexpected emotion, she freezes in her path and stares at the empty apartment, jim lingers by the door)

JIM

I'm going downstairs.

MARION

Jimmy, please.

JIM

This place gives me the creeps.

MARION

This was your father's apartment. There's nothing creepy about it.



On Tidy Endings

JIM

Says you.

MARION

You want to close the door, please? (jim reluctantly obeys)

MARION

Now, why don't you go check your room and make sure you didn't leave anything.

JIM

It's empty.

MARION

Go look.

JIM

I looked last time.

MARION

Honey, we sold the apartment. You're never going to be here again. Go make sure you have everything you want.

JIM

But Uncle Arthur packed everything.

MARION

Go make sure.


JIM

There's nothing in there.

MARION

I said make sure!


MARION

Everything's an argument with that one.

I can still smell you.

Jimmy? Are you okay?

JIM

Nothing. Told you so.

MARION

Uncle Arthur must have worked very hard. Make sure you thank him.

JIM

What for? Robbie says, "They love to clean up things!"

MARION

Sometimes you can be a real joy.

JIM

Did you call Aunt Helen?


MARION

Do I get a break here?

Wouldn't you like to say good-bye?

JIM

To who?

MARION

To the apartment. You and your daddy spent a lot of time here together. Don't you want to take one last look around?

JIM

Ma, get a real life.

MARION

"Get a real life."

Nice. Very nice.

JIM

Could you call already?

MARION

Jimmy, what does this look like I'm doing?

MARION

Helen? Hi, we're upstairs. . . . No, we just walked in the door. Jimmy wants to know if he can come down. . . . Oh, thanks.


MARION

Don't run in the halls! And don't play with the elevator buttons!

MARION

Hi. . . . No, I'm okay. It's a little weird being here. . . . No. Not since the funeral, and then there were so many people. Jimmy told me to get "a real life." I don't think I could handle anything realer. . . . No, please. Stay where you are. I'm fine. The doorman said Arthur would be right back and my lawyer should have been here already. . . . Well, we've got the papers to sign and a few other odds and ends to clean up. Shouldn't take long.

MARION

Hang on, that must be her.

Yes? . . . Thank you.

Helen? Yeah, it's the lawyer. I'd better go. . . . Well, I could use a stiff drink, but I drove down. Listen, I'll stop by on my way out. Okay? Okay. 'Bye.

MARION

That was quick.

JUNE

That was quicker. What, were you waiting by the door?

MARION

No. I was just passing it. Come on in.

JUNE

Have you got your notary seal?

MARION

I think so.

JUNE

Great. Then you can witness. I left mine at the office and thanks to gentrification I'm double-parked downstairs.

Where?

MARION

Anywhere. You mean you're not staying?

JUNE

If you really think you need me I can go down and find a parking lot. I think there's one over on Columbus. So, I can go down, park the car in the lot and take a cab back if you really think you need me.

MARION

Well . . . ?

JUNE

But you shouldn't have any problems. The papers are about as straightforward as papers get. Arthur is giving you power of attorney to sell the apartment and you're giving him a check for half the purchase price. Everything else is just signing papers that state that you know that you signed the other papers. Anyway, he knows the deal, his lawyers have been over it all with him, it's just a matter of signatures.

MARION

Oh, fine.

JUNE

Unless you just don't want to be alone with him . . . ?

MARION

With Arthur? Don't be silly.

JUNE

Then you'll handle it solo? Great. My car thanks you, the parking lot thanks you, and the cab driver that wouldn't have gotten a tip thanks you. Come have a quick look-see.

MARION

There are a lot of papers here.

JUNE

Copies. Not to worry. Start here.


JUNE

I ran into Jimmy playing Elevator Operator.

JUNE

I got him off at the sixth floor. Read on.

MARION

This is definitely not my day for dealing with him.

JUNE

I don't believe what's happening to this neighborhood. You made quite an investment when you bought this place.

MARION

Collin was always very good at figuring out those things.

JUNE

Well, he sure figured this place right. What, have you tripled your money in ten years?

MARION

More.

JUNE

It's a shame to let it go.

MARION

We're not ready to be a two-dwelling family.

JUNE

So, sublet it again.

MARION

Arthur needs the money from the sale.

JUNE

Arthur got plenty already. I'm not crying for Arthur.

MARION

I don't hear you starting in again, do I?

JUNE

Your interests and your wishes are my only concern.

MARION

Fine.

JUNE

I still say we should contest Collin's will.


MARION

June . . . !

JUNE

You've got a child to support.

MARION

And a great job, and a husband with a great job. Tell me what Arthur's got.

JUNE

To my thinking, half of everything that should have gone to you. And more. All of Collin's personal effects, his record collection . . .

MARION

And I suppose their three years together meant nothing.

JUNE

When you compare them to your sixteen-year marriage? Not nothing, but not half of everything.

MARION

(Trying to change the subject) June, who gets which copies?

JUNE

Two of each to Arthur. One you keep. The originals and anything else come back to me. (Looking around) I still say you should've sublet the apartment for a year and then sold it. You would've gotten an even better price. Who wants to buy an apartment when they know someone died in it. No one. And certainly no one wants to buy an apartment when they know the person died of AIDS.

MARION

June. Enough!

JUNE

Sorry. That was out of line. Sometimes my mouth does that to me. Hey, that's why I'm a lawyer. If my brain worked as fast as my mouth I would have gotten a real job.

MARION

What's this?

JUNE

I forgot. Arthur's lawyer sent that over yesterday. He found it in Collin's safety-deposit box. It's an insurance policy that came along with some consulting job he did in Japan. He either forgot about it when he made out his will or else he wanted you to get the full payment. Either way, it's yours.

MARION

Are you sure we don't split this?

JUNE

Positive.

MARION

But everything else . . . ?

JUNE

Hey, Arthur found it, his lawyer sent it to me.

Relax, it’s all yours. Minus my commission, of course. Go out and buy yourself something. Anything else before I have to use my cut to pay the towing bill?

MARION

I guess not.

JUNE

Great. Call me when you get home.

Look, I know that I'm attacking this a little coldly. I am aware that someone you loved has just died. But there's a time and place for everything. This is about tidying up loose ends, not holding hands. I hope you'll remember that when Arthur gets here. Call me.

MARION

Pens. We're going to need pens.

MARION

Oh, he won't care. One less thing to pack.

MARION

Oh, hi, Arthur. I didn't hear the door.

ARTHUR

Well hello, Marion.

MARION

I was going to ask you if you were thinking of taking this painting because if you're not going to then I'll take it. Unless, of course, you want it.

ARTHUR

No. You can have it.


MARION

I never really liked it, actually. I hate cats. I didn't even like the show. I needed something for my college dorm room. I was never the rock star poster type. I kept it in the back of a closet for years until Collin moved in here and took it. He said he liked it.

ARTHUR

I do too.

MARION

Well, then you keep it.

ARTHUR

No. Take it.

MARION

We've really got no room for it. You keep it.

ARTHUR

I don't want it.

MARION

Well, if you're sure.

ARTHUR

You want the teapot?

MARION

If you don't mind.

ARTHUR

One less thing to pack.

MARION

Funny, but that's exactly what I thought. One less thing to pack. You know, my mother gave it to Collin and me when we moved in to our first apartment. Silly sentimental piece of junk, but you know.

ARTHUR

That's not the one.

MARION

Sure it is. Hall used to make them for Westinghouse back in the thirties. I see them all the time at antiques shows and I always wanted to buy another, but they ask such a fortune for them.

ARTHUR

We broke the one your mother gave you a couple of years ago. That's a reproduction. You can get them almost anywhere in the Village for eighteen bucks.

MARION

Really? I'll have to pick one up.

ARTHUR

Take this one. I'll get another.

MARION

No, it's yours. You bought it.

ARTHUR

One less thing to pack.

MARION

Don't be silly. I didn't come here to raid the place.


ARTHUR

Well, was there anything else of Collin's that you thought you might like to have?

MARION

Now I feel so stupid, but actually I made a list. Not for me. But I started thinking about different people; friends, relatives, you know, that might want to have something of Collin's to remember him by. I wasn't sure just what you were taking and what you were throwing out. Anyway, I brought the list.

Of course these are only suggestions. You probably thought of a few of these people yourself. But I figured it couldn't hurt to write it all down. Like I said, I don't know what you are planning on keeping.

ARTHUR

I was planning on keeping it all.

MARION

Oh, I know. But most of these things are silly. Like his high school yearbooks. What would you want with them?

ARTHUR

Sure. I'm only interested in his Gay period.

MARION

I didn't mean it that way. Anyway, you look it over. They're only suggestions. Whatever you decide to do is fine with me.

ARTHUR

It would have to be, wouldn't it. I mean, it's all mine now. He did leave this all to me.

MARION

While we're on the subject of what's yours. I brought a batch of condolence cards that were sent to you care of me. Relatives mostly.

ARTHUR

More cards? I'm going to have to have another printing of thank-you notes done.

MARION

I answered these last week, so you don't have to bother. Unless you want to.

ARTHUR

Forge my signature?

MARION

Of course not. They were addressed to both of us and they're mostly distant relatives or friends we haven't seen in years. No one important.

ARTHUR

If they've got my name on them, then I'll answer them myself.

MARION

I wasn't telling you not to, I was only saying that you don't have to.

ARTHUR

I understand.


MARION

Let me put this back.

ARTHUR

I ran into Jimmy in the lobby.

MARION

Tell me you're joking.

ARTHUR

I got him to Helen's.

MARION

He's really racking up the points today.

ARTHUR

You know, he still can't look me in the face.

MARION

He's reacting to all of this in strange ways. Give him time. He'll come around. He's really very fond of you.

ARTHUR

I know. But he's at that awkward age: under thirty. I'm sure in twenty years we'll be the best of friends.

MARION

It's not what you think.

ARTHUR

What do you mean?


MARION

Well, you know.

ARTHUR

No I don't know. Tell me.

MARION

I thought that you were intimating something about his blaming you for Collin's illness and I was just letting you know that it's not true.

We discussed it a lot and ... uh ... he understands that his father was sick before you two ever met.

ARTHUR

I don't believe this.

MARION

I'm just trying to say that he doesn't blame you.

ARTHUR

First of all, who asked you? Second of all, that's between him and me. And third and most importantly, of course he blames me. Marion, he's eleven years old. You can discuss all you want, but the fact is that his father died of a "fag" disease and I'm the only fag around to finger.

MARION

My son doesn't use that kind of language.

ARTHUR

Forget the language. I'm talking about what he's been through. Can you imagine the kind of crap he's taken from his friends? That poor kid's been chased and chas-tised from one end of town to the other. He's got to have someone to blame just to survive. He can't blame you, you're all he's got. He can't blame his father; he's dead. So, Uncle Arthur gets the shaft. Fine, I can handle it.

MARION

You are so wrong, Arthur. I know my son and that is not the way his mind works.

ARTHUR

I don't know what you know. I only know what I know. And all I know is what I hear and see. The snide remarks, the little smirks . . . And it's not just the illness. He's been looking for a scapegoat since the day you and Collin first split up. Finally he has one.

MARION

Wait. Are you saying that if he's going to blame someone it should be me?

ARTHUR

I think you should try to see things from his point of view.

MARION

Where do you get off thinking you're privy to my son's point of view?

ARTHUR

It's not that hard to imagine. Life's rolling right along, he's having a happy little childhood, when suddenly one day his father's moving out. No explanations, no reasons, none of the fights that usually accompany such things. Divorce is hard enough for a kid to understand when he's listened to years of battles, but yours?

MARION

So what should we have done? Faked a few months' worth of fights before Collin moved out?

ARTHUR

You could have told him the truth, plain and simple.

MARION

He was seven years old at the time. How the hell do you tell a seven-year-old that his father is leaving his mother to go sleep with other men?

ARTHUR

Well, not like that.

MARION

You know, Arthur, I'm going to say this as nicely as I can: Butt out. You're not his mother and you're not his father.

ARTHUR

Thank you. I wasn't acutely aware of that fact. I will certainly keep that in mind from now on.

MARION

There's only so much information a child that age can handle.

ARTHUR

So it's best that he reach his capacity on the street.


MARION

He knew about the two of you. We talked about it.

ARTHUR

Believe me, he knew before you talked about it. He's young, not stupid.

MARION

It's very easy for you to stand here and criticize, but there are aspects that you will just never be able to understand. You weren't there. You have no idea what it was like for me. You're talking to someone who thought that a girl went to college to meet a husband. I went to protest rallies because I liked the music. I bought a guitar because I thought it looked good on the bed! This lifestyle, this knowledge that you take for granted, was all a little out of left field for me.

ARTHUR

I can imagine.

MARION

No, I don't think you can. I met Collin in college, married him right after graduation and settled down for a nice quiet life of Kids and Careers. You think I had any idea about this? Talk about life's little surprises. You live with someone for sixteen years, you share your life, your bed, you have a child together, and then you wake up one day and he tells you that to him it's all been a lie. A lie. Try that on for size. Here you are the happiest couple you know, fulfilling your every life fantasy and he tells you he's living a lie.

ARTHUR

I'm sure he never said that.


MARION

Don't be so sure. There was a lot of new ground being broken back then and plenty of it was muddy.

ARTHUR

You know that he loved you.

MARION

What's that supposed to do, make things easier? It doesn't. I was brought up to believe, among other things, that if you had love that was enough. So what if I wasn't everything he wanted. Maybe he wasn't exactly everything I wanted either. So, you know what? You count your blessings and you settle.

ARTHUR

No one has to settle. Not him. Not you.

MARION

Of course not. You can say, "Up yours!" to everything and everyone who depends and needs you, and go off to make yourself happy.

ARTHUR

It's not that simple.

MARION

No. This is simpler. Death is simpler.

Happy now?


ARTHUR

How about a nice hot cup of coffee? Tea with lemon? Hot cocoa with a marshmallow floating in it?

MARION

I was wrong. You are a mother.

MARION

I lied before. He was everything I ever wanted.

ARTHUR

When I came into the building and saw Jimmy in the lobby I absolutely freaked for a second. It's amazing how much they look alike. It was like seeing a little miniature Collin standing there.

MARION

I know. He's like Collin's clone. There's nothing of me in him.

ARTHUR

I always kinda hoped that when he grew up he'd take after me. Not much chance, I guess.

MARION

Don't do anything fancy in there.


ARTHUR

Please. Anything we can consume is one less thing to pack.

MARION

So you've said.

ARTHUR

So we've said.

MARION

I want to keep seeing you and I want you to see Jim. You're still part of this family. No one's looking to cut you out.

ARTHUR

Ah, who'd want a kid to grow up looking like me anyway. I had enough trouble looking like this. Why pass on the misery?

MARION

You're adorable.

ARTHUR

Is that like saying I have a good personality?

MARION

I think you are one of the most naturally handsome men I know.

ARTHUR

Natural is right, and the bloom is fading.


MARION

All you need is a few good nights' sleep to kill those rings under your eyes.

ARTHUR

Forget the rings under my eyes, how about the rings around my moon?

MARION

I like you like this.

ARTHUR

From the time that Collin started using the wheelchair until he died, about six months, I lost twenty-three pounds. No gym, no diet. In the last seven weeks I've gained close to fifty.

MARION

You're exaggerating.

ARTHUR

I'd prove it on the bathroom scale, but I sold it in working order.

MARION

You'd never know.

ARTHUR

Marion, you'd never know, but ask my belt. Ask my pants. Ask my underwear. Even my stretch socks have stretch marks. I called the ambulance at five a.m., he was gone at nine and by nine-thirty, I was on a first-name basis with Sara Lee. I can quote the business hours of every ice-cream parlor, pizzeria and bakery on the island of Manhattan. I know the location of every twenty-four-hour grocery in the greater New York area, and I have memorized the phone numbers of every Mandarin, Szechuan and Hunan restaurant with free delivery.

MARION

At least you haven't wasted your time on useless hobbies.

ARTHUR

Are you kidding? I'm opening my own Overeater's Hotline. We'll have to start small, but expansion is guaranteed.

MARION

You're the best, you know that? If I couldn't be everything that Collin wanted then I'm grateful that he found someone like you.

ARTHUR

Keep your goddamned gratitude to yourself. I didn't go through any of this for you. So your thanks are out of line. And he didn't find "someone like" me. It was me.

MARION

I didn't mean . . .

ARTHUR

And I wish you'd remember one thing more: He died in my arms, not yours.

ARTHUR

Look, I know you were trying to say something supportive. Don't waste your breath. There's nothing you can say that will make any of this easier for me. There's no way for you to help me get through this. And that's your fault. After three years you still have no idea or understanding of who I am. Or maybe you do know but refuse to accept it. I don't know and I don't care. But at least understand, from my point of view, who you are: You are my husband's ex-wife. If you like, the mother of my stepson. Don't flatter yourself into thinking you're any more than that. And whatever you are, you're certainly not my friend.

MARION

Why don't we just sign these papers and I'll be out of your way.

ARTHUR

Shouldn't you say I’ll be out of your way? After all, I'm not just signing papers, I'm signing away my home.

MARION

I’ll leave the papers here. Please have them notarized and returned to my lawyer.

ARTHUR

Don't forget my painting.

MARION

What do you want from me, Arthur?

ARTHUR

I want you the hell out of my apartment! I want you out of my life! And I want you to leave Collin alone!

MARION

The man's dead. I don't know how much more alone I can leave him.

ARTHUR

Lots more, Marion. You've got to let him go.

MARION

For the life of me, I don't know what I did, or what you think I did, for you to treat me like this. But you're not going to get away with it. You will not take your anger out on me. I will not stand here and be badgered and insulted by you. I know you've been hurt and I know you're hurting but you're not the only one who lost someone here.

ARTHUR

Yes I am! You didn't just lose him. I did! You lost him five years ago when he divorced you. This is not your moment of grief and loss, it's mine!

These condolences do not belong to you, they're mine.

His things are not yours to give away, they're mine! This death does not belong to you, it's mine! Bought and paid for outright. I suffered for it, I bled for it. I was the one who cooked his meals. I was the one who spoon-fed them. I pushed his wheelchair. I carried and bathed him. I wiped his backside and changed his diapers. I breathed life into and wrestled fear out of his heart. I kept him alive for two years longer than any doctor thought possible and when it was time I was the one who prepared him for death.

I paid in full for my place in his life and I will not share it with you. We are not the two widows of Collin Redding. Your life was not here. Your husband didn't just die. You've got a son and a life somewhere else. Your husband's sitting, waiting for you at home, wondering, as I am, what the hell you're doing here and why you can't let go.

ARTHUR

Let him go, Marion. He's mine. Dead or alive; mine.


ARTHUR

One marshmallow or two?

ARTHUR

Take three, they're small.

ARTHUR

Now let me tell you how I really feel.

MARION

Do you think that I sold the apartment just to throw you out?

ARTHUR

I don't care about the apartment . . .

MARION

. . . Because I really didn't. Believe me.

ARTHUR

I know.

MARION

I knew the expenses here were too much for you, and I knew you couldn't afford to buy out my half... I figured if we sold it, that you'd at least have a nice chunk of money to start over with.

ARTHUR

You could've given me a little more time.

MARION

Maybe. But I thought the sooner you were out of here, the sooner you could go on with your life.

ARTHUR

Or the sooner you could go on with yours.

MARION

Maybe.

Anyway, I'm not going to tell you that I have no idea what you're talking about. I'd have to be worse than deaf and blind not to have seen the way you've been treated. Or mistreated. When I read Collin's obituary in the newspaper and saw my name and Jimmy's name and no mention of you . . .

You know that his secretary was the one who wrote that up and sent it in. Not me. But I should have done something about it and I didn't. I know.

ARTHUR

Wouldn't have made a difference. I wrote my own obituary for him and sent it to the smaller papers. They edited me out.

MARION

I'm sorry. I remember, at the funeral, I was surrounded by all of Collin's family and business associates while you were left with your friends. I knew it was wrong. I knew I should have said something but it felt good to have them around me and you looked like you were holding up . . . Wrong. But saying that it's all my fault for not letting go ... ? There were other people involved.

ARTHUR

Who took their cue from you.

MARION

Arthur, you don't understand. Most people that we knew as a couple had no idea that Collin was Gay right up to his death. And even those that did know only found out when he got sick and the word leaked out that it was AIDS. I don't think I have to tell you how stupid and ill-informed most people are about homosexuality. And AIDS . . . ? The kinds of insane behavior that word inspires . . . ?

Those people at the funeral, how many times did they call to see how he was doing over these years? How many of them ever went to see him in the hospital? Did any of them even come here? So, why would you expect them to act any differently after his death? So, maybe that helps to explain their behavior, but what about mine, right? Well, maybe there is no explanation. Only excuses. And excuse number one is that you're right, I have never really let go of him. And I am jealous of you. Hell, I was jealous of anyone that Collin ever talked to, let alone slept with ... let alone loved. The first year, after he moved out, we talked all the time about the different men he was seeing. And I always listened and advised. It was kind of fun. It kept us close. It kept me a part of his intimate life. And the bottom line was always that he wasn't happy with the men he was meeting. So, I was always allowed to hang on to the hope that one day he'd give it all up and come home. Then he got sick.

He called me, told me he was in the hospital and asked if I'd come see him. I ran. When I got to his door there was a sign, instructions for visitors of an aids patient. I nearly died.

ARTHUR

He hadn't told you?

MARION

No. And believe me, a sign is not the way to find these things out. I was so angry . . . And he was so sick ... I was sure that he'd die right then. If not from the illness then from the hospital staffs neglect. No one wanted to go near him and I didn't bother fighting with them because I understood that they were scared. I was scared. That whole month in the hospital I didn't let Jimmy visit him once. You learn.

Well, as you know, he didn't die. And he asked if he could come stay with me until he was well. And I said yes. Of course, yes. Now, here's something I never thought I'd ever admit to anyone: had he asked to stay with me for a few weeks I would have said no. But he asked to stay with me until he was well and knowing there was no cure I said yes. In my craziness I said yes because to me that meant forever. That he was coming back to me forever. Not that I wanted him to die, but I assumed from everything I'd read . . . And we'd be back together for whatever time he had left. Can you understand that?

Two weeks later he left. He moved in here. Into this apartment that we had bought as an investment. Never to live in. Certainly never to live apart in. Next thing I knew, the name Arthur starts appearing in every phone call, every dinner conversation. "Did you see the doctor?"

"Yes. Arthur made sure I kept the appointment." "Are you going to your folks for Thanksgiving?" "No. Arthur and I are having some friends over." I don't know which one of us was more of a coward, he for not telling or me for not asking about you. But eventually you became a given. Then, of course, we met and became what I had always thought of as friends.

I don't care what you say, how could we not be friends with something so great in common: love for one of the most special human beings there ever was. And don't try and tell me there weren't times when you enjoyed my being around as an ally. I can think of a dozen occasions when we ganged up on him, teasing him with our intimate knowledge of his personal habits.

Blanket stealing? Snoring? Excess gas, no less?

I don't think that my loving him threatened your relationship. Maybe I'm not being truthful with myself. But I don't. I never tried to step between you. Not that I ever had the opportunity. Talk about being joined at the hip! And that's not to say I wasn't jealous. I was. Terribly. Hatefully. But always lovingly. I was happy for Collin because there was no way to deny that he was happy. With everything he was facing, he was happy. Love did that. You did that.

He lit up with you. He came to life. I envied that and all the time you spent together, but more, I watched you care for him (sometimes overcare for him), and I was in awe. I could never have done what you did. I never would have survived. I really don't know how you did.

ARTHUR

Who said I survived?

MARION

Don't tease. You did an absolutely incredible thing. It's not as if you met him before he got sick. You entered a relationship that you knew in all probability would end this way and you never wavered.

ARTHUR

Of course I did. Don't have me sainted, Marion. But sometimes you have no choice. Believe me, if I could've gotten away from him I would've. But I was a prisoner of love.

MARION

Stop.

ARTHUR

And there were lots of pluses. I got to quit a job I hated, stay home all day and watch game shows. I met a lot of doctors and learned a lot of big words.

And then there was all the exciting traveling I got to do. This box has a souvenir from each one of our trips. Wanna see?

ARTHUR

This is from the house we rented in Reno when we went to clear out his lungs.

This is from the hospital in Reno. Collin made them. They had a great arts and crafts program.

These are from a faith healer in Philly. They don't do much for a fever, but they look great with a green sweater.

These are from our first visit to the clinic in France. Such lovely people.

This is from our second visit to the clinic in France.

A Voodoo doctor in New Orleans. Next time we'll have to get there earlier in the year. I think he sold all the pretty ones at Mardi Gras.

Then there was Mexico. Black market drugs and empty wallets.

L.A., San Francisco, Houston, Boston . . . We traveled everywhere they offered hope for sale and came home with souvenirs.

Marion, I would have done anything, traveled anywhere to avoid ... or delay . . . Not just because I loved him so desperately, but when you've lived the way we did for three years . . . the battle becomes your life.

His last few hours were beyond any scenario I had imagined. He hadn't walked in nearly six months. He was totally incontinent. If he spoke two words in a week I was thankful. Days went by without his eyes ever focusing on me. He just stared out at I don't know what. Not the meals as I fed him. Not the TV I played constantly for company. Just out. Or maybe in. It was the middle of the night when I heard his breathing become labored. His lungs were filling with fluid again. I knew the sound. I'd heard it a hundred times before. So, I called the ambulance and got him to the hospital.

They hooked him up to the machines, the oxygen, shot him with morphine and told me that they would do what they could to keep him alive. But, Marion, it wasn't the machines that kept him breathing. He did it himself. It was that incredible will and strength inside him. Whether it came from his love of life or fear of death, who knows. But he'd been counted out a hundred times and a hundred times he fought his way back.

I got a magazine to read him, pulled a chair up to the side of his bed and holding his hand, I wondered whether I should call Helen to let the cleaning lady in or if he'd fall asleep and I could sneak home for an hour. I looked up from the page and he was looking at me. Really looking right into my eyes. I patted his cheek and said, "Don't worry, honey, you're going to be fine." But there was something else in his eyes. He wasn't satisfied with that. And I don't know why, I have no idea where it came from, I just heard the words coming out of my mouth, "Collin, do you want to die?" His eyes filled and closed, he nodded his head. I can't tell you what I was thinking, I'm not sure I was. I slipped off my shoes, lifted his blanket and climbed into bed next to him. I helped him to put his arms around me, and mine around him, and whispered as gently as I could into his ear, "It's alright to let go now. It's time to go on." And he did.

Marion, you've got your life and his son. All I have is an intangible place in a man's history. Leave me that. Respect that.

MARION

I understand.

ARTHUR

Jeez! With all the screamin' and sad storytelling I forget something.

I brung you flowers and everything.

MARION

You brought me flowers?

ARTHUR

Well, I knew you'd never think to bring me flowers and I felt that on an occasion such as this somebody oughta get flowers from somebody.

MARION

You know, Arthur, you're really making me feel like a worthless piece of garbage.

ARTHUR

So what else is new?

Just promise me one thing: Don't press one in a book. Just stick them in a vase and when they fade just toss them out. No more memorabilia.

MARION

Arthur, I want to do something for you and I don't know what. Tell me what you want.

ARTHUR

I want little things. Not much. I want to be remembered. If you get a Christmas card from Collin's mother, make sure she sent me one too. If his friends call to see how you are, ask if they've called me. Have me to dinner so I can see Jimmy. Let me take him out now and then. Invite me to his wedding.

MARION

You've got it.

ARTHUR

Let me get all this cold cocoa out of the way. We still have the deed to do.

MARION

And I've got to get Jimmy home in time for practice.

ARTHUR

Band practice?

MARION

Baseball.

About this list, you do what you want.

ARTHUR

Believe me, I will. But I promise to consider your suggestions. Just don't rush me. I'm not ready to give it all away.

ARTHUR

Hello? . . . Just a minute.

It's your eager Little Leaguer.

MARION

Hello, honey. . . . I'll be down in five minutes. No. You know what? You come up here and get me. . . . No, I said you should come up here. ... I said I want to come up here. . . . Because I said so. . . . Thank you.

ARTHUR

Alright, where do we start on these?

MARION

I guess you should just start signing everything and I'll stamp along with you. Keep one of everything on the side for yourself.

ARTHUR

Now I feel so rushed. What am I signing?

MARION

You want to do this another time?

ARTHUR

No. Let's get it over with. I wouldn't survive another session like this.

MARION

I keep meaning to ask you; how are you?

ARTHUR

Oh, you mean my health? Fine. No, I'm fine. I've been tested, and nothing. We were very careful. We took many precautions. Collin used to make jokes about how we should invest in rubber futures.

MARION

I'll bet.

ARTHUR

It never occurred to me until now. How about you?

MARION

Well, we never had sex after he got sick.

ARTHUR

But before?

MARION

I have the antibodies in my blood. No signs that it will ever develop into anything else. And it's been five years so my chances are pretty good that I'm just a carrier.

ARTHUR

I'm so sorry. Collin never told me.

MARION

He didn't know. In fact, other than my husband and the doctors, you're the only one I've told.

ARTHUR

You and your husband . . . ?

MARION

Have invested in rubber futures. There'd only be a problem if we wanted to have a child. Which we do. But we'll wait. Miracles happen every day.

ARTHUR

I don't know what to say.

MARION

Tell me you'll be there if I ever need you.

ARTHUR

Sure! Take something else that should have been mine.

MARION

Don't even joke about things like that.

ARTHUR

You know we'll never get these done today.

MARION

So, tomorrow.

JIM

C'mon, Ma. I'm gonna be late.

ARTHUR

Would you like to come in?

JIM

We've gotta go.

MARION

Jimmy, come on.

JIM

Ma!

MARION

Take these for Mommy.

JIM

Can we go?

MARION

Say good-bye to your Uncle Arthur.

JIM

'Bye, Arthur. Come on.

MARION

Give him a kiss, now.

ARTHUR

Marion, don't.

MARION

Give your uncle a kiss good-bye.

JIM

He's not my uncle.

MARION

No. He's a hell of a lot more than your uncle.

ARTHUR

A handshake will do.

MARION

Tell Uncle Arthur what your daddy told you.

JIM

About what?

MARION

Stop playing dumb. You know.

ARTHUR

Don't embarrass him.

MARION

Jimmy, please.

JIM

He said that after me and Mommy he loved you the most.



MARION

Go on.

JIM

And that I should love you too. And make sure that you're not lonely or very sad.

ARTHUR

Thank you.


MARION

Alright, kid, you done good. Now let's blow this joint before you muck it up.


MARION

A child's kiss is magic. Why else would they be so stingy with them. I'll call you.
