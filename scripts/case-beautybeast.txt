BEAUTY
Hail and farewell as they used to say! I mean, good evening Ladies and Gentlemen, beauties and beasts! I can see you’ve all taken sides. The die is cast, as they used to say. A thing of beauty is a joy forever, as they used to say! ( Sergeant approaches Rabbi and Gussie , who are uncomfortably seated side by side , and goads them to join her and her accordion in singing) BE GOOD TO YOUR ENEMIES, then the Lord above you’re sure to please! How do I know? The Bible tells me so! (Rabbi substitutes “Torah” for “Bible ”, which precipitates audible bickering upstage between him and Gussie over the wording. Salvation Army Sgt. stops singing , and regains control)
BEAUTY
(regaining control) Well! We’ve got a very very exciting show here for you tonight, and I just know you’re going to ignore it! ... adore it! What a lovely audience\ (She repeats that twice if there are less than ten people in the audience.) I’d like now to introduce you to tonight’s internationally known group of vaudeville performing stars, just off the redeye from - I think they’re from Palm Springs, Florida or something - so now lets meet them and greet them like true Christians and dedicated believers! Applaud, now! Don’t forget they took the train!
FATHER
(in dummy's voice) Shut up, Mom.
BEAUTY
Right. Now let’s begin.
FATHER
(practially whispering) Well maybe now I finally get a minute alone with a few intelligent men . . . you know I got to travel with these g’naven . . . these goyim . . . these madmen . . . that’s all it is today is madmen . . . I’m looking for a minion . . . you know ten men . . . are there ten men? (He begins counting in Yiddish the men in the audience. Beauty begins to clear her throat to get Father's attention) You know, my friends, the Jew always has suffered through the ages . . . (He sings)
FATHER
Beauty, how hard you work, and yet how sweetly you
BEAUTY
O Father, it is always summer where you are! And work is but the soft lace in which a lady cloaks herself in usefulness. Have not all virtuous ladies done more for their paters than I?
FATHER
Nay, Beauty, nay.
BEAST
Who let the horses in here?
FATHER
I am rich, Beauty, and I only prosper that you and your
BEAST
Why don’t you two just lighten up ?
BEAUTY
Yes, sweet sister, daughter of my same saintly father, you are right. How right you are! To proclaim the clear and matronly light over that which, itself being darkness, rapes in darkness and gets the day with child, a bastard baby, swaddled in the darkness that inheres in this pretentious conversation! Let us join hands and depart this house together, as it is Father’s pleasure and so our own.
FATHER
Beauty! You must groom what is coarse about intelligence, that it not come forth at five o’clock like the beard of a drinking gamesman. Breed it instead to whisper from your body, out from your head like longer, softer hair; and from your bosom like two plush promises. Let it be in your step
RABBI
( running to the audience) YOU see what I mean ... all this nonsense . .. I’ve been with them for weeks . . . HELP ME! You know, they tell me I can ride the train for less, and then I got to go Shabbos. You know I travel with these madmen, these schnor-rers - Baruch Shmo! ( singing ) Yoy, yoy, yoy, yoy.
BEAUTY
(getting his attention) KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. (Pause)
FATHER
(coming back into the scene) And who might that be? A suitor perhaps?
BEAST
I’ll get it. (She puts on a messenger's cap and acts the part of Messenger)
AMESSENGER
I’m sorry to have to tell you this, sir, but the market has crashed and furthermore your ships have been stolen and your fortune plundered and your American Express card cut into two pieces and returned to the company.
BEAUTY
Would you like a cup of tea?
MESSENGER
No thanks. My doctor says it makes me tense.
FATHER
(in anguish) When did this happen? How could this happen?
MESSENGER
About a fortnight ago, as it was reported, sir.
FATHER
How long is a fortnight?
BEAUTY
I’ll look it up in the dictionary. Father.
FATHER
Nay, Beauty, it matters not. A fortnight is a fart-night so far as I care. I am ruined, and my daughters with me. Shattered is the dream. (To Messenger) I must thank you, sir, for the pains you took, although they are a thousandfold greater pains to me.
MESSENGER
May I use your phone? I want to call the office. (Beast, as Messenger, turns upstage, takes off the bat, and returns as sister)
BEAST
Well that’s a fine HOWDY DO.
FATHER
Can you, most loving daughters, forgive a father who, thinking himself rich, was poor in judgement so that, lulled into complacency, let nature on his fortune take its course . . . (Father turns head from side to side to look at daughters, who turn heads in opposite direction, missing his gaze )
BEAUTY
It is nothing, Father. We will live as we have always lived, a little poorer in fashion but much richer in fidelity to you.
BEAST
What?
FATHER
Well, we will return to till the land. As we prospered, so shall we prevent our demise. We shall return to the land like humble farmers and by my work I shall provide for you as best a poor man can.
BEAUTY
It matters nothing to me, sweet Father, for my song is every day the same and my work the work of virtue. It raineth on the rich and poor alike, as the Bible says.
BEAST
A goddamned goody-goody on the premises. We ought to sell tickets and make back the money we lost.
FATHER
Yes, my Beauty, sing for your poor father. Let me hear your song. (They all agree to move the piano. Beast sets up next card
ALL
Her name was Kitty From Kansas City And it’s a pity She wasn’t pretty.
BEAUTY
She’s so dumb, but you should see her dance
ALL
I love her, I love her,
BEAST
She’s so dumb, and yet she’s really queer She thinks Einstein is one big glass of beer.
ALL
I love her, I love her,
FATHER
She’s asthmatic, but I never heard her wheeze
ALL
I love her, I love her,
BEAUTY
She’s so dense, but really she’s quite sweet
ALL
I love her, I love her,
ALL
They call her Kitty From Kansas City I love the girl because She’s not the girl she was She can cook and she can wash.
BEAST
(spoken) And when she makes love she’s the most wonderful .. .
ALL
Kitty, from Kansas City
BEAST
She’s so with it, she really is quite swell
RABBI
She’s so gross, yet surely I’ve seen worse
FATHER
Girls, girls! How poverty has degraded you! The next thing I know you will be snorting in the fields like animals! You work like dogs, eat like horses, sweat like pigs . . . (She walks into the scene and sits between them)
BEAUTY
Yes, Father, but we sleep like logs.
FATHER
And you act like kids!
BEAUTY
And we pray like lambs!
FATHER
Sing like larks!
BEAST
(punching Father) Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee! Father, after a little playful moment , sits down again, dejected.
FATHER
How could I have let this happen to me, to my beautiful daughters? I can scarcely forgive myself. We can barely pay the mortgage on the farm.
BEAST
You must pay the rent, you must pay the rent, you must pay the rent today.
BEAUTY
I can’t pay the rent, I can’t pay the rent, I can’t pay the rent today. (They repeat this until they realize that Father has left the scene)
BEAUTY
(trying to get Father's attention) Knock knock knock
BEAST
(getting the hat, thinking it's the cue to play the messenger
BEAUTY
What news of fortune but fortune makes it news?
MESSENGER
You get all those publications in the boondocks?
BEAUTY
Rest a moment, sit you down, I’ll call my father. Father, Father, F-A-T-H-E-R! (She continues screaming ‘Father' until she's worked herself into a rage)
FATHER
Yes, my most loved Beauty, you need but call and I will come.
BEAUTY
It is the same, the messenger, who came to tell of our demise; perhaps she can re-verse herself and with her message pen a sweeter poem.
FATHER
(to Messenger) Good man, why have you come? State your business.
MESSENGER
Ahem! My business is your business, sir. Need I be bullish on a miracle? Marry, lynch me not before I tell you, sir, that your fortune’s been recovered and it’s said that the ship with all your merchandise, merchant’s dice, if I recall it, has been found and is lodged at Port O’Storm. Geth you tither, I mean, Get you thither, and look to it.
FATHER
Do you speak true?
MESSENGER
I smoke Viceroy. (He takes off the hat and begins to clear the stage of the chair and sheep)
BEAUTY
O Father, great happiness, that have returned to you what (Father interrupts, saying ‘comma’) for all your work (Father
BEAST
I don’t get my period anymore . . . it’s been thirty years since my last period . . .
FATHER
(taking Beauty's hands in his) Now, Beauty, I will debark at sunrise to the foreign land she describes. What can I bring you?
BEAST
An older woman! Disarmament! Abortion on demand! The E.R.A. before I die!
FATHER
Yes, I will. And you, Beauty, what for you?
BEAUTY
If you have your health. Father, I have all I like.
FATHER
Nay, Beauty, there must be something ... some small thing again. Most comely miss, is your father at home?
BEAUTY
(looking at him with love in her eyes) Yes, I’m afraid he is.
MESSENGER
I bring good news for him, news of his fortune. that will please you ... I’ll not return without a gift for you ... tell me ... a fur . . . perhaps a ruby, red with the blood secretly shed by all stones ... a sapphire blue as Coltrane blew . . . what will it be . . . tell me, my dear . . .
BEAUTY
Well, there is one thing . . .
FATHER
Yes . . .
BEAUTY
O Father, a rose, and it please you, a single red rose . . . FATHER
BEAUTY
In a rose I see what’s in a name. A name is a name is a name, but Father, in a rose is everything. One single, beautiful red rose.
FATHER
SO BE IT! Goodbye, my darling! We will be together again soon.
FATHER WALKS TO THE PIANO AND BEGINS TO PLAY
THE WATER GATE BREAK-IN. Father and Beast cross to the ship. Beast puts on the messenger's hat.
FATHER
What foreign land has fortune-hunting pulled me to? How many a man lured by fortune asks himself as he stands alone in the twilight if he’s come to the right place? Nobody owns the darkness, no matter how great his fortune. I am a bit lost . . . but here’s the dock. (He sees Messenger) What, you again?
MESSENGER
Ay, marry . . .
FATHER
Your social life is of no concern to me.
MESSENGER
Marry, sir, it seems Fate has appointed me your courier.
FATHER
Scab laborer thou art! Fate has laid off your betters.
MESSENGER
Your sex life is of no concern to me, sir.
FATHER
On with it then. Where is my ship which you as Fate’s courier have promised me?
MESSENGER
I’m sorry to have to say this sir, but your fortune is lost, the market has crashed, et cetera.
FATHER
And my American Express card?
MESSENGER
TWO pieces.
FATHER
I sensed as much. Are you an actor?
FATHER
Now don’t start playing Hamlet on me!
MESSENGER
(pause; then whispering a cue to Father) Enough . . . Enough.
FATHER
Enough! Enough! I must wend my sad way home, bereft not once but twice. Would I were dead! At least worms would eat.
MESSENGER
If worms ate wishes your bane would be their banquet.
FATHER
Are you starting Macbeth now?
MESSENGER
Oh, forget it! (He exits.)
FATHER
Off with me. If I can but pick a rose for my Beauty I can better bear the sting of these other thorns. I have no sense of humor. (He looks around , then raises his arm) Taxi! Taxi!
RABBI
(to the audience) You know, I look like a jerk but I respect myself. I respect the Rabbi, I respect the Cohen, I respect even the Ba’al Shem Tov, if you should pardon the expression. But there is one person in my opinion is closer to God than the Rabbi, than the Cohen, even than the Ba’al Shem Tov, and that’s the stand-up comic. (He assumes the stance of a stand-up comedian)
MESSENGER
( proudly , straightening up) I’m JAMES DEAN.
FATHER
My luck! A two-bit ham and cheese!
MESSENGER
(returning to character) Take arms against this sea of troubles! Have you a daughter?
FATHER
What mysterious nourishment! Laid out for me as though I were expected. Born of misfortune and suckled at a strange table! Tis the story of every babe, and I am a child of misfortune. I know not of its ways. (He looks around and continues) A sound sleep. Never have I slept so well. My dreams were full of color; my duty black and white
BEAST
Well, that really does it. You can’t just go picking my roses. You ingrate! I hire the finest cordon blah chef to serve you a decent meal, I set up a sleeping palett for you on the marble floor there, I rise you up early in the morning as if by magic, I put hallucinogenic drugs in your food that enhanced your dreams and this is the thanks I get! You must not pick my roses! My soul is in my roses. O, scar! Scar!
FATHER
No thanks, I don’t smoke.
BEAST
That’s not funny.
FATHER
Yes, it is.
BEAST
I have lived here for many years, alone and unloved. My ugliness has kept me to myself. Many is the traveler who, lost or broken, has found his way to my table and eaten as you have. Only those who are heartbroken survive.
FATHER
And the others?
BEAST
I EAT THEM!
FATHER
Do you know this tall guy? I believe he hails from around here ... a messenger by trade . . . would-be actor.
BEAST
Hm . . . no, I don’t think so.
FATHER
I can just tell he’s delicious.
BEAST
I’m not really hungry. I eat out of loneliness, but I never eat the lonely.
FATHER
So one might call you a consumer of happiness. BEAST
FATHER
What wilt thou with me?
BEAST
You must stay here and live with me forever. You have stolen from me, and now I will steal from you. Your freedom is mine.
FATHER
But I have my daughters to tend to . . . their love is as great as their loveliness renowned ... I cannot stay with you.
BEAST
Stay with me you must.
FATHER
All I did was pick a rose.
BEAST
All Iphigenia did was die.
FATHER
You mean it, then?
BEAST
Never words meant more.
FATHER
Grant me one thing, then
BEAST
Will you return?
FATHER
I shirk my debts to no man.
BEAST
I’m not a man.
FATHER
I don’t look for loopholes.
BEAST
Either you must return by sundown, or you must send someone in your stead. One of your daughters, perhaps. A curse is upon me; if you or one of yours does not return, all the wrath of a broken heart will descend upon you and your daughters; all the ugliness in my face will disfigure your spirits.
FATHER
Then I must hie me hence, these many many miles. For the last time I will kiss my children. In a way ’tis a blessing. I am a failure to them and they languish in my care.
BEAST
Yet you will be happy here. You will not languish here. I am tamed by kindness and gentle in my ways. I have suffered an awful lot. The forest breathes my breaths; the fawns and does draw close to me. The moons spins for me in a breathtaking dance; and if I wish for two things that contradict each other, leaving me to choose between one sweet thing and another, then a large green silken flower, a Vernon as it’s called, springs up from the ground, and in it are the seeds of both things, and I plant them in the ground and both things grow up together from the soil, side by side, as I sleep, and when I wake I may pluck them both.
FATHER
No shit?! Then why don’t you get rid of this curse and live like normal animals?
BEAST
It is the nature of the curse that I cannot wish for that. Wishing is all and I am not wishing well.
FATHER
You’re no fountain of youth either.
BEAST
Time rushes. Hurry with your costly rose, and return yourself or your soul in your Daughter to me by sundown.
FATHER
As I must, so I will. The cost of rose is thorn, ’tis Beauty’s knife; that Beauty’s gift will cost the giver’s life.
BEAUTY
This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the turning point, the moment of decision, the denouement. Will the father return in good faith and live out his life with one so much less fortunate than himself, or will he sacrifice his pure and lovely daughter to a life of unholy cohabitation, subjecting her to the Sodom and Gomorra of Beastiality and perhaps even homosexuality. Or, will the Beast repent of its ways and come to know that God loves even the sick and the ugly. Well, Ladies and Gentlemen, I want you to think what you might do in this situation, and we’ll return to our story, but first . . . This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is your turning point, your moment of decision, your denouement.
ALL
Johnny Cash’s face was original sin
BEAUTY 
Now you might have heard of Patti Smith. She was fast becoming a legend in her own time, a product of the ‘me’ generation - the limousines and the record contracts filled Patti’s life but not her heart. She soon fell prey to that god of all rockstars
ALL
Patti Smith was livin’ on the wild side Doing CBGB’s on nitrous oxide On the right side In the nick of time She was saved by Jesus,
BEAUTY
Now you might have heard of Bob Dylan. Bob had always been considered a prophet ... not a prophet of God, but a prophet of hedonism, paganism, and yes, even communism. And it was not until Bob’s name had faded from the pop charts, and he found himself alone and idle, that he saw the error of his ways. And he came to know the true prophet of God, and the rest is history. Bob made a come-back. Jesus saved Bob in the nick of time!
ALL
Dylan thought he had sub-terranean blues
BEAUTY
Well, I could go on forever, Ladies and Gentlemen, listing those celebrities for God. I can even name friends like Liberace and Billie Jean King whose lives may not have taken such downward turn if they had taken Jesus as their personal savior. But I want you to look into your own hearts. I want you to make room for him, and I want you to let him save you in the nick of time.
ALL
Take Jesus as your savior and you’ll go real far ‘Cause everyone thinks Jesus is a Hollywood star On the right side In the nick of time.
BEAST
Scene . . . (she looks around) seven.
LATHER
Beauty, I brought you a present. Guess what it is.
BEAUTY
A COW.
FATHER
No!
BEAUTY
A chicken!
FATHER
No!
BEAUTY
A book of verse!
FATHER
No!
BEAUTY
A babe in a basket!
FATHER
No!
BEAUTY
I cannot guess. Tell me, Father. Give me a cue. A clue.
FATHER
(Looking at the rose) It is something that combines the grace of all these
FATHER
(taking Beauty's head in his hands, peering at her) Do you paint your face now, my dear? I’ve never know you to use cosmetics.
BEAUTY
Nay, Father, ’tis worse; I paint my soul with outward show, that it not reveal fear for the heart of a Father that’s broken.
FATHER
I’m not broken, I'm broke!
BEAUTY
What happened?
FATHER
After much meandering I found the dock, and cuddled herein was a boat pillaged, plundered, barely mine. That dreadful man, that beastly messenger, came to attend me . . .
BEAUTY
What did he say, Father?
FATHER
He said all the same stuff he said the first time he came
BEAUTY
And you believed him?
FATHER
It’s funny. When mutton talks, I listen.
BEAUTY
What else happened, Father?
FATHER
I walked and I walked and with such sadness. And then I went through a forest, feeling ever so hungry and sad. I got to a castle, Beauty, a mauve and turreted castle, and when I entered, a table instantly set for me with morsels of such delicacy a king could not have turned from. I ate, and I ate. I slept and I slept. And when I awoke, a rose, like a puppet of God, popped up and I picked it.
BEAUTY
What then . .. O Father, hurry!
FATHER
A BEAST APPEARED! He was UGLY! He yelled at me for picking the rose and told me I must live with him forever! This turreted castle is to be my jail! I must return and live with him forever!
BEAUTY
You had a bad dream, Father, you are overwrought.
FATHER
NAY, ’tis all too real. I must return by sundown, or send a loved one in my stead.
BEAUTY
What mean you?
BEAUTY
O Father! Didst bring me a single red rose?
FATHER
Ay, Beauty, and a thousand thorns to go with it.
BEAUTY
Father, why so sad? You’re back and well, and the flower is beautiful. I missed you so much, my sweet sire! I yearned for your company! The noise of your absence frightened me. Never was a stay louder.
FATHER
The beast for all its beastliness seemed to sense the refinement of love
BEAUTY
Father, before we are parted forever, grant me one favor.
FATHER
Anything but a rose, my daughter, you before whom the rose pales in grace.
BEAUTY
Let me go in your place.
FATHER
Never!
BEAUTY
Yes!
FATHER
No!
BEAUTY
Yes!
FATHER
No!
BEAUTY
Yes!
FATHER
Well, all right.
BEAUTY
How should I get there, Father? The sun already hangs low in the pouch of the day; she will soon give birth to the dark and terrible night of our eternal loneliness.
FATHER
I’ll call you a cab.
BEAUTY
No, Father, I’ll take the bus.
FATHER
I don’t want you taking public transportation at this hour.
BEAUTY
My spirit already transported, I care not for the stops called out to the flesh by invisible motormen.
FATHER
Then go as you will, my daughter.
BEAUTY
I’ve always wanted to be Katharine Hepburn.
FATHER
I’ve always wanted to be Martin Buber.
BEAUTY
I’ve always admired a good dramatic actress.
FATHER
You know any? (He exits.)
BEAUTY
I’ll be reading tonight from Macbeth, act one, scene five. (She corrects herself) Act 5, Scene 1. (As she reads the speech , she is overtaken by the angry and sexual meaning of the words)
BEAST CHANGES TO NEW CARD
WHEN VAUDEVILLE MEETS THE FAIRY TALE. She gets a tutu out of the suitcase and hands it to Father.
BEAST
Get dressed, Hitchcock. This is the part of the play where you play Beauty and you meet the Beast in the forest for the first time. Could we have some music please? And some classical lighting? This is a classical piece.
BEAST AND LATHER DO A BALLET PIECE ENDING WITH BEAST LIFTING FATHER

ALL
Salvation Army, Salvation Army Put a nickle in the drum save another drunken bum Salvation Army, Salvation Army Put a nickle in the drum and you’ll be saved.
BEAST
Well Mrs Alston, what a fine day we’re having today.
FATHER
(in dummy’s voice) That I know, my ice cream’s running down the street.
BEAST
Why I remember when I was a young girl in weather like this, girls wore skirts down to their ankles.
FATHER
Yeah, but they started at their knees. Yuck yuck yuck!
BEAUTY
Salvation Army, Salvation Army Put a nickle in the drum save another drunken bum Salvation Army, Salvation Army Put a nickle in the drum and you’ll be saved.
BEAST
And in fine weather like this the men are always out on the street and they say such interesting things to the women as they walk past.
FATHER
Yeah, like ‘I want to suck your pussy.’
BEAST
Mrs Alston, these nice people came to the theater tonight to get away from the things they hear on the streets. They didn’t come expecting to hear . . .
FATHER
Go out and get your own courage, mother fucking bitch. Suck my dick!
BEAST
But think about it, Mrs Alston. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if men said such nice things to women as they passed on the street. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if they said things like . . .
FATHER
You want to share a chocolate soda? You want to go for a walk in the moonlight?
BEAST
What a wonderful world that would be, Mrs Alston.
FATHER
Yeah, but they’d blow it in the end, that I know. They’d blow up all the people and leave the buildings!
ALL
Reagan, moral-shaper
BEAST CHANGES THE CARD
ROME-OWED WEI AT JULI-ET. Beauty sits in front of the castle with a giant knife and fork. Beast enters in the Beast robe and watches Beauty eat.
BEAST
Will you have dinner with me?
BEAUTY
As you wish, Beast, you are the master here.
BEAST
Do you find me ugly?
BEAUTY
Yes, but I think you must be very kind.
BEAST
Oh, I am kind, but I’m stupid.
BEAUTY
Oh, you’re not so stupid. People who are truly stupid are too stupid to know it.
BEAUTY
Beauty you make me really happy! Marry me.
BEAUTY
(between bites) Unh unh.
BEAST
Why?
BEAUTY
I can’t.
BEAST
Why not?
BEAUTY
No.
BEAST
I love you.
BEAUTY
What would our children be like?
BEAST
Marry me.
BEAUTY
No.
BEAST
Darling! I’ll take you on a honeymoon to Olympus and feed you mint and honey with my hands.
BEAUTY
I like your fried chicken (She smacks her lips and eats). BEAST
BEAUTY
Unh unh.
BEAST
Please.
BEAUTY
No.
BEAST
I’ll be Gertrude Stein to your Alice B. Toklas. I’ll be Spencer Tracy to your Katharine Hepburn. I’ll be James Dean to your . . . Montgomery Clift.
BEAUTY
Well, I always wanted to be Katharine Hepburn.
BEAST
I always wanted to be James Dean.
BEAUTY
I was Katharine Hepburn.
BEAST
I was James Dean.
BEAUTY
I was Katharine Hepburn and the girl who lived down the hall from me freshman year of college was (taking on the character of Katharine Hepburn) Spencer Tracy.
BEAST
I was James Dean (taking on the character of James Dean) and when I slept with a woman for the first time she threw me out of bed on the floor and told me I was sick.
BEAUTY
(in Hepburn's voice) Spencer used to write me poems, bring me roses in the morning, and take me for rides in her red convertible.
BEAST
I went to work the next day and passed out; I was in a coma for two weeks.
BEAUTY
One Christmas, Spencer bought me a white fur coat.
BEAST
Not only did I have spinal meningitis, but I had mononucleosis, and the doctor told me I couldn’t kiss a boy for a year. (She smiles broadly)
BEAUTY
My mother told me that I shouldn’t accept expensive gifts from girls. But I wasn’t worried . . . She wasn’t a girl, she was Spencer Tracy.
BEAST
Then my girlfriend married a boy who thought he was James Dean. So I married a boy who thought he was Lauren Bacall.
BEAUTY
Then one evening, Spencer and I decided to go out to the movies together. As we were leaving the dormitory, by mistake we checked the ‘dating’ instead of ‘non-dating’ column.
BEAST
Then I fell in love with a woman at work and she fell in love with me.
BEAUTY
When we got home that evening the dorm mother was in the doorway, and she wanted to know just what had been going on.
BEAST
All my fantasies were turning into realities so I went to a shrink and I fell in love with her too.
BEAUTY
As far as I knew, nothing had been ‘going on.’ But later that evening they took Spencer to the hospital in a straight jacket.
BEAST
I got all my stuff together and left Lauren Bacall. I moved in with the woman from work only to find that she thought she was James Dean.
BEAUTY
I found out later that she wasn’t Spencer Tracy at all. I found out much later that I had been in love with her.
BEAST
Will you marry me, then, Beauty?
BEAST
I’ll be back tomorrow. (She exits and returns immediately) Beauty, I’m so lonely in the forest without you.
BEAUTY
Eat! It helps.
BEAST
I’ll be back tomorrow. (She exits and returns) Marry me. BEAUTY
BEAST
If I can’t have you no one can.
BEAUTY
You may be right but I can’t consent.
BEAST
( crying ) I’ll be back tomorrow.
BEAST
(holding Father in a dip) So, Daddy’s little girl is going home.
FATHER
I’m not your little girl. I’m not your little goil. I have a shoirt. I have a schul. I’m not a little goil. I HAVE a little goil. I’m a FATHER. (He explodes) I PLAY THE FATHER HERE. (He storms off)
BEAST
(turning to Beauty , who has awakened from her faint) So Daddy’s little girl is going home.
BEAUTY
Thank you, Beast, for granting me leave.
BEAST
Will you miss me?
BEAUTY
In my way, I will. I’ll miss your voice, your laughter, your step on my stairs. Pray for my father.
BEAST
I eat my prey.
BEAUTY
We’re very different, Beast.
BEAST
I know, that’s why I love you so.
BEAST
This is the part of the show where the beast dies and you’re supposed to feel sorry for me. But don’t fall for it! They’ve tried it before. They’ve tried it with Dracula, with King Kong. Reagan tried it! I bet a couple years ago you thought Reagan got shot ... he never got shot, they did it in a video workshop! I know, I was there! Moonwalkers - I bet you thought America went to the moon - they never went to the moon - those were the days of television - they did it in a television studio! Moonwalkers, all of them! Nixon kidnapped Patti Hearst. John Wayne killed Martin Luther King, I know! I was there. In every heart there’s a Hollywood, where emotions are raised and stricken like sets, kisses and kindness are contracts, hopes are coming attractions. If she says she’s coming back, lock the door - that way you can say she came but you didn’t hear her. (Beast dies. Beauty rushes to her. Beast sits up) ‘Nancy, I forgot to duck . . . (Beast dies again , then sits up) I hope all you doctors are Republican.’ (Beast dies.)
BEAUTY
Oh Beast! Oh Beast! (She doesn't respond so she whispers)
BEAST
Don’t fall for it, Beauty! Don’t fall for it, I know!
BEAST
When I was young, I came home from school and my house was surrounded by fire trucks. My mother was sobbing on the front lawn because her washing machine had blown up from too much use and as I was standing there clasping onto my school books, looking at the smoke coming out of the basement I said to myself,
BEAUTY
Goodbye.
BEAST
Goodbye. Don’t forget! Come back in one week or I die!

THE END. Then Beast takes Beauty in her arms and kisses her. Father keeps playing as the lights black out.
EIGHTS UP

A you’re an Afiscoten B you’re a belly-button C you’re a cantaloupe with arms
