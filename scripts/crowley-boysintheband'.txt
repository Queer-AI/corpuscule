MICHAEL

Donald! You're about a day and a half early!

DONALD

[Enters] The doctor canceled!

MICHAEL

Canceled! How'd you get inside?

DONALD

The street door was open.

MICHAEL

You wanna drink?

DONALD

[Going to bedroom to deposit his bag] Not until I've had my shower. I want something to work-out today—I want to try to relax and enjoy something.

MICHAEL

You in a blue funk because of the doctor?

DONALD

[Returning] Christ, no. I was depressed long before I got there.

MICHAEL

Why'd the prick cancel?

DONALD

A virus or something. He looked awful.

MICHAEL

[Holding up a shopping bag] Well, this'll pick you up. I went shopping today and bought all kind of goodies. Sandalwood soap . . .

DONALD

[Removing his socks and shoes] I feel better already.

MICHAEL

[Producing articles] . . . Your very own toothbrush because I'm sick to death of your using mine.

DONALD

How do you think I feel.



MICHAEL

YouVe had worse things in your mouth.

[Holds up a cylindrical can] And, also for you . . . something called "Control." Notice nowhere is it called hair spray—just simply "Control." And the words "For Men" are written about thirty-seven times all over the goddamn can!

DONALD

It's called Butch Assurance.

MICHAEL

Well, it's still hair spray—no matter if they call it "Balls"\

[donald laughs] It's all going on your very own shelf, which is to be labeled: Donald's Saturday Night Douche Kit. By the way, are you spending the night?

DONALD

Nope. I'm driving back. I still get very itchy when I'm in this town too long. I'm not that well yet.

MICHAEL

That's what you say every weekend.

DONALD

Maybe after about ten more years of analysis I'll be able to stay one night.

MICHAEL

Maybe after about ten more years of analysis you'll be able to move back to town permanently.

DONALD

If I live that long.


MICHAEL

You will. If you don't kill yourself on the Long Island Expressway some early Sunday morning. I'll never know how you can tank up on martinis and make it back to the Hamptons in one piece.

DONALD

Believe me, it's easier than getting here. Ever had an anxiety attack at sixty miles an hour? Well, tonight I was beside myself to get to the doctor—and just as I finally make it, rush in, throw myself on the couch, and vomit out how depressed I am, he says, "Donald, I have to cancel tonight— I'm just too sick."

MICHAEL

Why didn't you tell him you're sicker than he is.

DONALD

He already knows that.

[ donald goes to the bedroom, drops his shoes and socks.

MICHAEL follows] MICHAEL

Why didn't the prick call you and cancel. Suppose you'd driven all this way for nothing.

DONALD

[Removing his shirt] Why do you keep calling him a prick?

MICHAEL

Whoever heard of an analyst having a session with a patient for two hours on Saturday evening.

DONALD

He simply prefers to take Mondays off.



MICHAEL

Works late on Saturday and takes Monday off—what is he, a psychiatrist or a hairdresser?

DONALD

Actually, he's both. He shrinks my head and combs me out.

[Lies on the bed] Besides, I had to come in town to a birthday party anyway. Right?

MICHAEL

You had to remind me. If there's one thing I'm not ready for, it's five screaming queens singing Happy Birthday.

DONALD

Who's coming?

MICHAEL

They're really all Harold's friends. It's his birthday and I want everything to be just the way he'd want it. I don't want to have to listen to him kvetch about how nobody ever does anything for anybody but themselves.

DONALD

Himself.

MICHAEL

Himself. I think you know everybody anyway—they're the same old tired fairies you've seen around since the day one. Actually, there'll be seven, counting Harold and you and me.

DONALD

Are you calling me a screaming queen or a tired fairy?

MICHAEL

Oh, I beg your pardon—six tired screaming fairy queens and one anxious queer.

DONALD

You don't think Harold'll mind my being here, do you? Technically, I'm yoiir friend, not his.

MICHAEL

If she doesn't like it, she can twirl on it. Listen, I'll be out of your way in just a second. I've only got one more thing to do.

DONALD

Surgery, so early in the evening?

MICHAEL

Sunt! That's French, with a cedilla.

[Gives him a crooked third finger, goes to mirror] I've just got to comb my hair for the thirty-seventh time. Hair—that's singular. My hair, without exaggeration, is clearly falling on the floor. And fast, baby!

DONALD

You're totally paranoid. You've got plenty of hair.

MICHAEL

What you see before you is a masterpiece of deception. My hairline starts about here. [Indicates his crotvn] All this is just tortured forward.

DONALD

Well, I hope, for your sake, no strong wind comes up.



MICHAEL

If one does, I'll be in terrible trouble. I will then have a bald

head and shoulder-length fringe.

[Runs his fingers through his hair, holds it away from his scalp, dips the top of his head so that donald can see. don-ald is silent]

Not good, huh?

DONALD

Not the best.

MICHAEL

It's called, "getting old." Ah, life is such a grand design— spring, summer, fall, winter, death. Whoever could have thought it up?

DONALD

No one we know, that's for sure.

MICHAEL

[Turns to study himself in the mirror, sighs] Well, one thing you can say for masturbation . . . you certainly don't have to look your best.

[Slips out of the robe, flings it at donald. donald lauglis,

takes the robe, exits to the bath, michael takes a sweater

out of a chest, pulls it on]

MICHAEL

What are you so depressed about? I mean, other than the usual everything. [A beat]

DONALD

[Reluctantly] I really don't want to get into it.


MICHAEL

Well, if you're not going to tell me, how can we have a conversation in depth —a warm, rewarding, meaningful friendship?

DONALD

Up yours!

MICHAEL

[SoutJiern accent] Why, Cap'n Butler, how you talk!

[rausc. donald appears in the doorway holding a tfass of water and a small bottle of pills, michael looks up]

DONALD

It's just that today I finally realized that I was raised to be a failure. I was groomed for it. [A beat]

MICHAEL

You know, there was a time when you could have said that to me and I wouldn't have known what the hell you were talking about.

DONALD

[Takes some pills] Naturally, it all goes back to Evelyn and Walt.

MICHAEL

Naturally. When doesn't it go back to Mom and Pop. Unfortunately, we all had an Evelyn and a Walt. The crumbs! Don't you love that word—crumb? Oh, I love it! It's a real Barbara Stanwyck word.

[A la Stanwyck's frozen-lipped Brooklyn accent] "Cau'll me a keab, you kr-rumm."



DONALD

Well, I see all vestiges of sanity for this evening are now officially shot to hell.

MICHAEL

Oh, Donald, you're so serious tonight! You're fun-starved, baby, and I'm eating for two!

[Sings] "Forget your troubles, c'mon get happy! You better chase all your blues away. Shout, 'Hallelujah!' c'mon get happy . . ."

[Sees donald isn't buying it] —what's more boring than a queen doing a Judy Garland imitation?

DONALD

A queen doing a Bette Davis imitation.

MICHAEL

Meanwhile—back at the Evelyn and Walt Syndrome.

DONALD

America's Square Peg and America's Round Hole.

MICHAEL

Christ, how sick analysts must get of hearing how mommy and daddy made their darlin' into a fairy.

DONALD

It's beyond just that now. Today I finally began to see how some of the other pieces of the puzzle relate to them.—Like why I never finished anything I started in my life . . . my neurotic compulsion to not succeed. I've realized it was always when I failed that Evelyn loved me the most—because it displeased Walt, who wanted perfection. And when

I fell short of the mark she was only too happy to make up for it with her love. So I began to identify failing with winning my mother's love. And I began to fail on purpose to get it. I didn't finish Cornell—I couldn't keep a job in this town. I simply retreated to a room over a garage and scrubbing floors in order to keep alive. Failure is the only thing with which I feel at home. Because it is what I was taught at home.

MICHAEL

Killer whales is what they are. Killer whales. How many whales could a killer whale kill . . .

DONALD

A lot, especially if they get them when they were babies. [Pause, mk hael suddenly (cars off his sweater, throw* it in the air, letting it land where it ma:/, whips out (mother, putts it on as he starts down the stairs for the living room, donald follows]

Hey! Where're you going?

MICHAEL

To make drinks! I think we need about thirty-seven!

DONALD

Where'd you get that sweater?

MICHAEL

This clever little shop on the right bank called Hermes.

DONALD

I work my ass off for forty-five lousy dollars a week scrubbing floors and you waltz around throwing cashmere sweaters on them.



MICHAEL

The one on the floor in the bedroom is vicuna.

DONALD

I beg your pardon.

MICHAEL

You could get a job doing something else. Nobody holds a gun to your head to be a charwoman. That is, how you say, your neurosis.

DONALD

Gee, and I thought it's why I was born.

MICHAEL

Besides, just because I wear expensive clothes doesn't necessarily mean they're paid for.

DONALD

That is, how you say, your neurosis.

MICHAEL

I'm a spoiled brat, so what do I know about being mature. The only thing mature means to me is Victor Mature, who was in all those pictures with Betty Grable.

[Sings a la Grable] "I can't begin to tell you, how much you mean to me . . ." Betty sang that in 1945. '45?—'43. No, '43 was "Coney Island," which was remade in '50 as "Wabash Avenue." Yes, "Dolly Sisters" was in '45.

DONALD

How did I manage to miss these momentous events in the American cinema. I can understand people having an affinity



for the stage—but movies are such garbage, who can take them seriously.

MICHAEL

Well, I'm sorry if your sense of art is offended. Odd as it may seem, there wasn't any Shubert Theatre in Hot Coffee, Mississippi!

DONALD

However—thanks to the silver screen, your neurosis has got style. It takes a certain flair to squander one's unemployment check at Pavillion.

MICHAEL

What's so snappy about being head over heels in debt. The only thing smart about it is the ingenious ways I dodge the bill collectors.

DONALD

Yeah. Come to think of it, you're the type that gives faggots a bad name.

MICHAEL

And you, Donald, you are a credit to the homosexual. A reliable, hard-working, floor-scrubbing, bill-paying fag who don't owe nothin' to nobody.

DONALD

I am a model fairy.

[michael has taken some ribbon and paper and begun to wrap Harold's birthday gift]

MICHAEL

You think it's just nifty how I've always flitted from Beverly Hills to Rome to Acapulco to Amsterdam, picking up a lot



of one-night stands and a lot of custom-made duds along the trail, but I'm here to tell you that the only place in all those miles—the only place I've ever been happy —was on the goddamn plane.

[Puffs up the bow on the package, continues] Bored with Scandinavia, try Greece. Fed up with dark meat, try light. Hate tequila, what about slivovitz. Tired of boys, what about girls—or how about boys and girls mixed and in what combination? And if you're sick of people, what about poppers? Or pot or pills or the hard stuff. And can you think of anything else the bad baby would like to indulge his spoiled-rotten, stupid, empty, boring, selfish, self-centered self in? Is that what you think has style, Donald? Hull? Is that what you think you've missed out on—my hysterical escapes from country to country, party to party, bar to bar, bed to bed, hangover to hangover, and all of it, hand to mouth!

[A beat] Run, charge, run, buy, borrow, make, spend, run, squander, beg, run, run, run, waste, waste, waste!

[A beat] And why? And why?

DONALD

Why, Michael? Why?

MICHAEL

I really don't want to get into it.

DONALD

Then how can we have a conversation in depth?

MICHAEL

Oh, you know it all by heart anyway. Same song, second verse. Because my Evelyn refused to let me grow up. She was determined to keep me a child forever and she did one helluva job of it. And my Walt stood by and let her do it.

[A beat] What you see before you is a thirty-year-old infant. And it was all done in the name of love—what she labeled love and probably sincerely believed to be love, when what she was really doing was feeding her own need—satisfying her own loneliness.

[A beat ] She made me into a girl-friend dash lover.

[A beat] We went to all those goddamn cornball movies together. I picked out her clothes for her and told her what to wear and she'd take me to the beauty parlor with her and we'd both get our hair bleached and a permanent and a manicure.

[A beat] And Walt let this happen.

[A beat] And she convinced me that I was a sickly child who couldn't run and play and sweat and get knocked around—oh, no! I was frail and pale and, to hear her tell it, practically female. I can t tell you the thousands of times she said to me, "I declare, Michael, you should have been a girl." And I guess I should have—I was frail and pale and bleached and curled and bedded down with hot-water bottles and my dolls and my paper dolls, and my doll clothes and my doll houses!

[Quick beat] And Walt bought them for me!

[Beat. With increasing speed] And she nursed me and put Vicks salve on my chest and cold cream on my face and told me what beautiful eyes I had and what pretty lips I had. She bathed me in the same tub with her until I grew too big for the two of us to fit. She made me sleep in the same bed with her until I was fourteen years old—until I finally flatly refused to spend one more night there. She didn't want to prepare me for life or how to be out in the world on my own or I might have left her. But I left anyway. This goddamn cripple finally wrenched free and limped away. And here I am—unequipped, undisciplined, untrained, unprepared and unable to live!

[A beat] And do you know until this day she still says, "I don't care if you're seventy years old, you'll always be my baby." And can I tell you how that drives me mad! Will that bitch never understand that what I'll always be is her son—but that I haven't been her baby for twenty-five years!

[A beat] And don't get me wrong. I know it's easy to cop out and blame Evelyn and Walt and say it was their fault. That we were simply the helpless put-upon victims. But in the end, we are responsible for ourselves. And I guess—I'm not sure —but I want to believe it—that in their own pathetic, dangerous way, they just loved us too much.

[A beat] Finis. Applause.

[donald hesitates, walks over to michael, puts his arms

around him and holds him. It is a totally warm and caring

gesture] There's nothing quite as good as feeling sorry for yourself, is there?

DONALD

Nothing.

MICHAEL

[A la Bette Davis] I adore cheap sentiment.


[Breaks away] Okay, I'm taking orders for drinks. What'll it be?

DONALD

An extra-dry-Beefeater-martini-on-the-rocks-with-a-twist.

MICHAEL

Coming up.

[donald exits up the stairs into the bath; michael into the

kitchen.

Momentarily, michael returns, carrying an ice bucket in

one hand and a silver tray of cracked crab in the other,

singing "Acapulco" or "Down Argentine Way" or some other

forgotten Grable tune.

The telephone rings]

MICHAEL

[Answering it] Backstage, "New Moon."

[A beat] Alan? My God, I don't believe it. How are you? Where are you? In town! Great! When'd you get in? Is Fran with you? Oh. What? No. No, I'm tied up tonight. No, tonight's no good for me. —You mean, now? Well, Alan, ole boy, it's a friend's birthday and I'm having a few people. —No, you wouldn't exactly call it a birthday party—well, yes, actually I guess you would. I mean, what else would you call it. A wake, maybe. I'm sorry I can't ask you to join us—but—well, kiddo, it just wouldn't work out. —No, it's not place cards or anything. It's just that—well, I'd hate to just see you for ten minutes and . . . Alan? Alan? What's the matter? —Are you —are you crying? —Oh, Alan, what's wrong? —Alan, listen, come on over. No, no, it's perfectly all right. Well, just hurry up. I mean, come on by and have a drink, okay? Alan . . . are you all right? Okay. Yeah. Same old address. Yeah. Bye.

[Slowly hangs up, stares blankly into space, donald appears,

bathed and changed. He strikes a pose]



DONALD

Well. Am I stunning?

[MICHAEL looks Up] MICHAEL

[Tonelessly] You're absolutely stunning. —You look like shit, but I'm absolutely stunned.

DONALD

[Crestfallen] Your grapes are, how you say, sour.

MICHAEL

Listen, you won't believe what just happened.

DONALD

Where's my drink?

MICHAEL

I didn't make it—I've been on the phone.

[donald goes to the bar, makes himself a martini]

MICHAEL

My old roommate from Georgetown just called.

DONALD

Alan what's-his-name?

MICHAEL

McCarthy. He's up here from Washington on business or something and he's on his way over here.

DONALD

Well, I hope he knows the lyrics to Happy Birthday.


MICHAEL

Listen, asshole, what am I going to do? He's straight. And Square City!

["Top Drawer" accent through clenched teeth] I mean, he's rally vury proper. Auffully good family.

DONALD

[Same accent] That's so important.

MICHAEL

[Regular speech] I mean, they look down on people in the theatre —so whatta you think he'll feel about this freak show I've got booked for dinner?

DONALD

[Sipping his drink] Christ, is that good.

MICHAEL

Want some cracked crab?

DONALD

Not just yet. Why'd you invite him over?

MICHAEL

He invited himself. He said he had to see me tonight. Immediately. He absolutely lost his spring on the phone— started crying.

DONALD

Maybe he's feeling sorry for himself too.



MICHAEL

Great heaves and sobs. Really boo-hoo-hoo-time—and that's not his style at all. I mean, he's so pulled-together he wouldn't show any emotion if he were in a plane crash. What am I going to do?

DONALD

What the hell do you care what he thinks.

MICHAEL

Well, I don't really but...

DONALD

Or are you suddenly ashamed of your friends?

MICHAEL

Donald, you are the only person I know of whom I am truly ashamed. Some people do have different standards from yours and mine, you know. And if we don't acknowledge them, we're just as narrow-minded and backward as we think they are.

DONALD

You know what you are, Michael? You're a real person.

MICHAEL

Thank you and fuck you.

[michael crosses to take a piece of crab and nibble on it] Want some?

DONALD

No, thanks. How could you ever have been friends with a bore like that?


MICHAEL

Believe it or not, there was a time in my life when I didn't go around announcing that I was a faggot.

DONALD

That must have been before speech replaced sign language.

MICHAEL

Don't give me any static on that score. I didn't come out until I left college.

DONALD

It seems to me that the first time we tricked we met in a gay bar on Third Avenue during your junior year.

MICHAEL

Cunt.

DONALD

I thought you'd never say it.

MICHAEL

Sure you don't want any cracked crab?

DONALD

Not yet! If you dont mind!

MICHAEL

Well, it can only be getting colder. What time is it?

DONALD

I don't know. Early.

MICHAEL

Where the hell is Alan?



DONALD

Do you want some more club soda?

MICHAEL

What?

DONALD

There's nothing but club soda in that glass. It's not gin— like mine. You want some more?

MICHAEL

No.

DONALD

I've been watching you for several Saturdays now. You've actually stopped drinking, haven't you.

MICHAEL

And smoking too.

DONALD

And smoking too. How long's it been?

MICHAEL

Five weeks.

DONALD

That's amazing.

MICHAEL

I've found God.

DONALD

It is amazing—for you.


MICHAEL

Or is God dead?

DONALD

Yes, thank God. And don't get panicky just because I'm paying you a compliment. I can tell the difference.

MICHAEL

You always said that I held my liquor better than anybody you ever saw.

DONALD

I could always tell when you were getting high—one way.

MICHAEL

I'd get hostile.

DONALD

You seem happier or something now—and that shows.

MICHAEL

[Quietly] Thanks.

DONALD

What made you stop—the analyst?

MICHAEL

He certainly had a lot to do with it. Mainly, I just didn't think I could survive another hangover, that's all. I don't think I could get through that morning-after ick attack.

DONALD

Morning-after what?



MICHAEL

Icks! Anxiety! Guilt! Unfathomable guilt—either real or imagined—from that split second your eyes pop open and you say, "Oh, my God, what did I do last night!" and ZAP, Total recall!

DONALD

Tell me about it!

MICHAEL

Then, the coffee, aspirin, Alka-Seltzer, Darvon, Daprisal, and a quick call to LA.—Icks Anonymous.

DONALD

"Good morning, LA."

MICHAEL

"Hi! Was I too bad last night? Did I do anything wrong? I didn't do anything terrible, did I?"

DONALD

[Laughing] How many times! How many times!

MICHAEL

And from then on, that struggle to live till lunch, when you have a double Bloody Mary—that is, if youve waited until lunch—and then you're half pissed again and useless for the rest of the afternoon. And the only sure cure is to go to bed for about thirty-seven hours, but who ever does that. Instead, you hang on till cocktail time, and by then you're ready for what the night holds—which hopefully is another party, where the whole goddamn cycle starts over! [A beat ]


Well, I've been on that merry-go-round long enough and I either had to get off or die of centrifugal force.

DONALD

And just how does a clear head stack up with the dull fog of alcohol?

MICHAEL

Well, all those things youVe always heard are true. Nothing can compare with the experience of one's faculties functioning at their maximum natural capacity. The only thing is ... I'd kill for a drink.

[The wall-panel buzzer sounds]

DONALD

Joe College has finally arrived.

MICHAEL

Suddenly, I have such an ick!

[Presses the wall-panel button] Now listen, Donald . . .

DONALD

[Quick] Michael, don't insult me by giving me any lecture on acceptable social behavior. I promise to sit with my legs spread apart and keep my voice in a deep register.

MICHAEL

Donald, you are a real card-carrying cunt.

[The apartment door buzzes several times, michael goes to it, pauses briefly before it, tears it open to reveal emory, larry and hank, emory is in Bermuda shorts and a sweater. larry has on a turtleneck and sandals, hank is in a dark Ivy League suit with a vest and has on cordovan shoes.

EMORY

[Bursting in] ALL RIGHT THIS IS A RAID! EVERYBODY'S UNDER ARREST!

[This entrance is followed by a loud raucous laugh as emory throws his arms around michael and gives him a big kiss on the cheek. Referring to dish] Hello, darlinl Connie Casserole. Oh, Mary, don't ask.

MICHAEL

[Weary already] Hello, Emory. Put it in the kitchen. [emory spots donald]

EMORY

Who is this exotic woman over here?

MICHAEL

Hi, Hank. Larry.

[They say, "Hi," shake hands, enter, michael looks out in the hall, comes back into the room, closes the door]

DONALD

Hi, Emory.

EMORY

My dear, I thought you had perished! Where have you been hiding your classically chiseled features?

DONALD

[To emory] I don't live in the city any more.

MICHAEL

[To larry and hank, referring to the gifts] Here, I'll take those. Where's yours, Emory?

EMORY

It's arriving later.

[ emory exits to the kitchen, larry and donald's eyes have met. hank has handed michael his gift — larry is too preoccupied]

HANK

Larry!—Larry!

larry What!

HANK

Give Michael the gift!

LARRY

Oh. Here.

[To hank] Louder. So my mother in Philadelphia can hear you.

hank Well, you were just standing there in a trance.

MICHAEL

[To larry and hank as emory reenters] You both know Donald, don't you?

DONALD

Sure. Nice to see you.

[To hank] Hi.



HANK

[Shaking hands] Nice to meet you.

MICHAEL

Oh, I thought you'd met.

DONALD

Well...

LARRY

We haven't exactly met but we've ... Hi.

DONALD

Hi.

HANK

But you've what?

LARRY

. . . Seen . . . each other before.

MICHAEL

Well, that sounds murky.

HANK

You've never met but you've seen each other.

LARRY

What was wrong with the way I said it.

HANK

Where?


EMORY

[Loud aside to michael] I think they're going to have their first fight.

LARRY

The first one since we got out of the taxi.

MICHAEL

[Referring to emoey] Where'd you find this trash.

LARRY

Downstairs leaning against a lamppost.

EMORY

With an orchid behind my ear and big wet lips painted over the lipline.

MICHAEL

Just like Maria Montez.

DONALD

Oh, please!

EMORY

[To donald] What have you got against Maria—she was a good woman.

MICHAEL

Listen, everybody, this old college friend of mine is in town and he's stopping by for a fast drink on his way to dinner somewhere. But, listen, he's straight, so ...

LARRY

Straight! If it's the one I met, he's about as straight as the Yellow Brick Road.



MICHAEL

No, you met Justin Stuart.

HANK

I don't remember anybody named Justin Stuart.

LARRY

Of course you don't, dope. I met him.

MICHAEL

Well, this is someone else.

DONALD

Alan McCarthy. A very close total stranger.

MICHAEL

It's not that I care what he would think of me, really—it's just that he's not ready for it. And he never will be. You understand that, don't you, Hank?

HANK

Oh, sure.

LARRY

You honestly think he doesn't know about you?

MICHAEL

If there's the slightest suspicion, he's never let on one bit.

EMORY

What's he had, a lobotomy?

[He exits up the stairs into the bath]

MICHAEL

I was super-careful when I was in college and I still am whenever I see him. I don't know why, but I am.


DONALD Tilt.

MICHAEL

You may think it was a crock of shit, Donald, but to him I'm sure we were close friends. The closest. To pop that balloon now just wouldn't be fair to him. Isn't that right?

LARRY

Whatever's fair.

MICHAEL

Well, of course. And if that's phony of me, Donald, then that's phony of me and make something of it.

DONALD

I pass.

MICHAEL

Well, even you have to admit it's much simpler to deal with the world according to its rules and then go right ahead and do what you damn well please. You do understand that, don't you?

DONALD

Now that you've put it in layman's terms.

MICHAEL

I was just like Alan when I was in college. Very large in the dating department. Wore nothing but those constipated Ivy League clothes and those ten-pound cordovan shoes.

[To hank] No offense.



HANK

Quite all right.

MICHAEL

I butched it up quite a bit. And I didn't think I was lying to myself. I really thought I was straight.

EMORY

[Coming downstairs tucking a Kleenex into his sleeve] Who do you have to fuck to get a drink around here?

MICHAEL

Will you light somewhere?

[ emory sits on steps] Or I thought I thought I was straight. I know I didn't come out till after I'd graduated.

DONALD

What about all those weekends up from school?

MICHAEL

I still wasn't out. I was still in the "Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome."

LARRY

The what?

MICHAEL

The Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome. You know, when you made it with some guy in school and the next day when you had to face each other there was always a lot of shit-kicking crap about, "Man, was I drunk last night! Christ, I don't remember a thing!" [Everyone laughs]


DONALD

You were just guilty because you were Catholic, that's all.

MICHAEL

That's not true. The Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome knows no religion. It has to do with immaturity. Although I will admit there's a high percentage of it among Mormons.

EMORY

Trollop.

MICHAEL

We all somehow managed to justify our actions in those days. I later found out that even Justin Stuart, my closest friend . . .

DONALD

Other than Alan McCarthy.

MICHAEL

[A look to donald] . . . was doing the same thing. Only Justin was going to Boston on weekends.

[ emory and larry laugh]

LARRY

[To hank] Sound familiar?

MICHAEL

Yes, long before Justin or I or God only knows how many others came out, we used to get drunk and "horse around" a bit. You see, in the Christ-was-I-drunk-last-night syndrome, you really are drunk. That part of it is true. It's just that you also do remember everything.

[General laughter] Oh God, I used to have to get loaded to go in a gay bar!



DONALD

Well, times certainly have changed.

MICHAEL

They have. Lately I've gotten to despise the bars. Everybody just standing around and standing around—it's like one eternal intermission.

HANK

[To LARRY]

Sound familiar?

EMORY

I can't stand the bars either. All that cat-and-mouse business —you hang around staring at each other all night and wind up going home alone.

MICHAEL

And pissed.

LARRY

A lot of guys have to get loaded to have sex.

[Quick look to hank, who is unamused] So I've been told.

MICHAEL

If you remember, Donald, the first time we made it I was so drunk I could hardly stand up.

DONALD

You were so drunk you could hardly get it up.

MICHAEL

[Mock innocence] Christ, I was so drunk I don't remember.



DONALD

Bullshit, you remember.

MICHAEL

[Sings to donald] "Just friends, lovers no more . . ."

EMORY

You may as well be. Everybody thinks you are anyway.

DONALD

We never were — really.

MICHAEL

We didn't have time to be—we got to know each other too fast.

[Door buzzer sounds] Oh, Jesus, it's Alan! Now, please everybody, do me a favor and cool it for the few minutes he's here.

EMORY

Anything for a sis, Mary.

MICHAEL

That's exactly what I'm talking about, Emory. No camping!

EMORY

Sorry.

[Deep, deep voice to donald] Think the Giants are gonna win the pennant this year?

DONALD

[Deep, deep voice] Fuckin' A, Mac.



[michael goes to the door, opens it to reveal Bernard, dressed in a shirt and tie and sport jacket. He carries a birthday gift and two bottles of red wine]

EMORY

[Big scream] Oh, it's only another queen!

BERNARD

And it ain't the Red one, either.

EMORY

It's the queen of spades!

[bernard enters, michael looks out in the hall]

MICHAEL

Bernard, is the downstairs door open?

BERNARD

It was, but I closed it.

MICHAEL

Good.

[bernard starts to put wine on bar]

MICHAEL

[Referring to the two bottles of red wine] I'll take those. You can put your present with the others.

[michael closes the door, bernard hands him the gift. The phone rings]

BERNARD

Hi, Larry. Hi, Hank.

MICHAEL

Christ of the Andes! Donald, will you bartend please.

BERNARD

[Extending his hand to donald] Hello, Donald. Good to see you.

DONALD

Bernard.

MICHAEL

[Answers phone] Hello? Alan?

EMORY

Hi, Bernardette. Anybody ever tell you you'd look divine in a hammock, surrounded by louvres and ceiling fans and lots and lots of lush tropical ferns?

BERNARD

[To EMORY]

You're such a fag. You take the cake.

EMORY

Oh, what about the cake—whose job was that?

LARRY

Mine. I ordered one to be delivered.

EMORY

How many candles did you say put on it—eighty?

MICHAEL

. . . What? Wait a minute. There's too much noise. Let me go to another phone.

[Presses the hold button, hangs up, dashes toward stairs]

LARRY

Michael, did the cake come?



MICHAEL

No.

DONALD

[To michael as he passes] What's up?

MICHAEL

Do I know?

LARRY

Jesus, I'd better call. Okay if I use the private line?

MICHAEL

[Going upstairs]

Sure.

[Stops dead on stairs, turns]

Listen, everybody, there's some cracked crab there. Help

yourselves.

[donald shakes his head, michael continues up the stairs to the bedroom, larry crosses to the phone, presses the free-line button, picks up receiver, dials Information]

DONALD

Is everybody ready for a drink?

[hank and Bernard say, "Yeah"]

EMORY

[Flipping up his sweater] Ready! I'll be your topless cocktail waitress.

BERNARD

Please spare us the sight of your sagging tits.

EMORY

[To HANK, LARRY]

What're you having, kids?


MICHAEL

[Having picked up the bedside phone] ... Yes, Alan ...

LARRY

Vodka and tonic. [Into phone] Could I have the number for the Marseilles Bakery in Manhattan.

EMORY

A vod and ton and a ...

HANK

Is there any beer?

EMORY

Beer! Who drinks beer before dinner?

RERNARD

Beer drinkers.

DONALD

That's telling him.

MICHAEL

... No, Alan, don't be silly. What's there to apologize for?

EMORY

Truck drivers do. Or ... or wallpaperers. Not school teachers. They have sherry.

HANK

This one has beer.



EMORY

Well, maybe school teachers in public schools.

[To LARRY]

How can a sensitive artist like you live with an insensitive bull like that?

LARRY

[Hanging up the phone and redialing] I can't.

BERNARD

Emory, you'd live with Hank in a minute, if he'd ask you. In fifty-eight seconds. Lord knows, you're sssensitive.

EMORY

Why don't you have a piece of watermelon and hush up!

MICHAEL

. .. Alan, don't be ridiculous.

DONALD

Here you go, Hank.

HANK

Thanks.

LARRY

Shit. They don't answer.

DONALD

What're you having, Emory?

BERNARD

A Pink Lady.

EMORY

A vodka martini on the rocks, please.

LARRY

[Hangs up] Well, let's just hope.

[donald hands larry his drink — their eyes meet again. A faint smile crosses larry's lips, donald returns to the bar to make emory's drink]

MICHAEL

Lunch tomorrow will be great. One o'clock—the Oak Room at the Plaza okay? Fine.

BERNARD

[To donald] Donald, read any new libraries lately?

DONALD

One or three. I did the complete works of Doris Lessing this week. I've been depressed.

MICHAEL

Alan, forget it, will you? Right. Bye.

[Hangs up, starts to leave the room — stops. Quickly pulls off the sweater he is wearing, takes out another, crosses to the stairs]

DONALD

You must not work in Circulation any more.

BERNARD

Oh, I'm still there—every day.

DONALD

Well, since I moved, I only come in on Saturday evenings. [Moves his stack of books off the bar]



HANK

Looks like you stock up for the week.

[michael rises and crosses to steps landing]

BERNARD

Are you kidding—that'll last him two days.

EMORY

It would last me two years. I still haven't finished Atlas Shrugged, which I started in 1912.

MICHAEL

[To DONALD]

Well, he's not coming.

DONALD

It's just as well now.

BERNARD

Some people eat, some people drink, some take dope ...

DONALD

I read.

MICHAEL

And read and read and read. It's a wonder your eyes don't turn back in your head at the sight of a dust jacket.

HANK

Well, at least he's a constructive escapist.

MICHAEL

Yeah, what do I do—take planes. No, I don't do that any more. Because I don't have the money to do that any more. I go to the baths. That's about it.



EMORY

I'm about to do both. I'm flying to the West Coast—

BERNARD

You still have that act with a donkey in Tijuana?

EMORY

I'm going to San Francisco on a well-earned vacation.

LARRY

No shopping?

EMORY

Oh, I'll look for a few things for a couple of clients, but I've been so busy lately I really couldn't care less if I never saw another piece of fabric or another stick of furniture as long as I live. I'm going to the Club Baths and I'm not out till they announce the departure of TWA one week later.

BERNARD

[To EMORY]

You'll never learn to stay out of the baths, will you. The last time Emily was taking the vapors, this big hairy number strolled in. Emory said, "I'm just resting," and the big hairy number said, "I'm just arresting!" It was the vice! [Everybody laughs]

EMORY

You have to tell everything, don't you.

[ donald crosses to give emory his drink] Thanks, sonny. You live with your parents?

DONALD

Yeah. But it's all right—they're gay.



[emory roars, slaps hank on the knee, hank gets up, moves away, donald turns to michael] What happened to Alan?

MICHAEL

He suddenly got terrible icks about having broken down on the phone. Kept apologizing over and over. Did a big about-face and reverted to the old Alan right before my very eyes.

DONALD

Ears.

MICHAEL

Ears. Well, the cracked crab obviously did not work out. [Starts to take away the tray]

EMORY

Just put that down if you don't want your hand slapped. I'm about to have some.

MICHAEL

It's really very good.

[Gives donald a look] I don't know why everyone has such an aversion to it.

DONALD

Sometimes you remind me of the Chinese water torture. I take that back. Sometimes you remind me of the relentless Chinese water torture.

MICHAEL

Bitch.

[hank has put on some music]

BERNARD

Yeah, baby, let's hear that sound.


EMORY

A drumbeat and their eyes sparkle like Cartier's.

[bernard starts to snap his fingers and move in time with

the music, michael joins in] I wonder where Harold is.

EMORY

Yeah, where is the frozen fruit?

MICHAEL

[To donald] Emory refers to Harold as the frozen fruit because of his former profession as an ice skater.

EMORY

She used to be the Vera Hruba Ralston of the Borscht Circuit.

[michael and Bernard are now dancing freely]

BERNARD

[To michael] If your mother could see you now, she'd have a stroke.

MICHAEL

Got a camera on you?

[The door panel buzzes, emory lets out a yelp]

EMORY

Oh my God, it's Lily Law! Everybody three feet apart!

[michael goes to the panel, presses the button, hank turns down the music, michael opens the door a short way, pokes his head out]

BERNARD

It's probably Harold now.

[michael leans back in the room]



MICHAEL

No, it's the delivery boy from the bakery.

LARRY

Thank God.

[michael goes out into the hall, fulling the door almost closed behind him]

EMORY

[Loudly] Ask him if he's got any hot-cross buns!

HANK

Come on, Emory, knock it off.

BERNARD

You can take her anywhere but out.

EMORY

[To hank] You remind me of an old-maid school teacher.

HANK

You remind me of a chicken wing.

EMORY

I'm sure you meant that as a compliment. [hank turns the music back up]

MICHAEL

[In hall] Thank you. Good night.

[michael returns with a cake box, closes the door, and takes it into the kitchen]


LARRY

Hey, Bernard, you remember that thing we used to do on Fire Island?

[larry starts to do a kind of Madison]

BERNARD

That was "in" so far back I think I've forgotten.

EMORY

7 remember.

[Pops up — starts doing the steps, larry and Bernard start to follow]

LARRY

Yeah. That's it.

[michael enters from the kitchen, falls in line with them]

MICHAEL

Well, if it isn't the Geriatrics Rockettes.

[Now they all are doing practically a precision routine, don-

ald comes to sit on the arm of a ciiair, sip his drink, and

watch in fascination, hank goes to the bar to get another

beer.

The door buzzer sounds. No one seems to hear it. It buzzes

again, hank turns toward the door, hesitates. Looks toward

michael, who is now deeply involved in the intricacies of

the dance. No one, it seems, lias heard the buzzer but hank,

who goes to the door, opens it wide to reveal alan. He is

dressed in black tie.

The dancers continue, turning and slapping their knees and

heels and laughing with abandon. Suddenly michael looks

up, stops dead, donald sees this and turns to see what

michael has seen. Slowly he stands up.

michael goes to the record player, turns it off abruptly.

emory, larry, and Bernard come to out-of-step halts, look

to see whafs happened]



MICHAEL

I thought you said you weren't coming.

ALAN

I. .. well, I'm sorry ...

MICHAEL

[Forced lightly] We were just—acting silly ...

ALAN

. . . Actually, when I called I was in a phone booth around the corner. My dinner party is not far from here. And . . .

MICHAEL

. . . Emory was just showing us this . . . silly dance.

ALAN

. . . Well, then I walked past and your downstairs door was open and . . .

MICHAEL

This is Emory.

[emory curtsies, michael glares at him] Everybody, this is Alan McCarthy. Counterclockwise, Alan: Larry, Emory, Bernard, Donald, and Hank.

[They all mumble "Hello," "Hi"] Would you like a drink?

ALAN

Thanks, no. I ... I can't stay . . . long . . . really.

MICHAEL

Well, you're here now, so stay. What would you like?


ALAN

Do you have any rye?

MICHAEL

I'm afraid I don't drink it any more. You'll have to settle for gin or Scotch or vodka.

DONALD

Or beer.

ALAN

Scotch, please.

[michael starts for bar]

DONALD

I'll get it.

[Goes to bar]

HANK

[Forced laugh] Guess I'm the only beer drinker.

ALAN

[Looking around group] Whose .. . birthday ... is it?

LARRY

Harold's.

ALAN

[Looking from face to face] Harold?

BERNARD

He's not here yet.



EMORY

She's never been on time . ..

[michael shoots emory a withering glance] He's never been on time in his . ..

MICHAEL

Alan's from Washington. We went to college together. Georgetown.

[A heat. Silence]

EMORY

Well, isn't that fascinating.

[ donald hands alan his drink]

DONAED

If that's too strong, I'll put some water in it.

ALAN

[Takes a quick gulp] It's fine. Thanks. Fine.

HANK

Are you in the government?

ALAN

No. I'm a lawyer. What... what do you do?

HANK

I teach school.

ALAN

Oh. I would have taken you for an athlete of some sort. You look like you might play sports ... of some sort.



HANK

Well, I'm no professional but I was on the basketball team in college and I play quite a bit of tennis.

ALAN

I play tennis too.

HANK

Great game.

ALAN

Yes. Great.

[A beat. Silence] What... do you teach?

HANK

Math.

ALAN

Math?

HANK

Yes.

ALAN

Math. Well.

EMORY

Kinda makes you want to rush out and buy a slide rule, doesn't it.

MICHAEL

Emory. I'm going to need some help with dinner and you're elected. Come on!



EMORY

I'm always elected.

BERNARD

You're a natural-born domestic.

EMORY

Said the African queen! You come on, too—you can fan me while I make the salad dressing.

MICHAEL

[Glaring. Phony smile]

RIGHT THIS WAY, EMORY!

[michael pushes the swinging door aside for emory and Bernard to enter. They do and he follows. The door swings closed, and the muffled sound of Michael's voice can be heard] [Offstage]

You son-of-a-bitch!

EMORY

[Offstage] What the hell do you want from me?

hank Why don't we all sit down.

ALAN

... Sure.

[hank and alan sit on the couch, larry crosses to the bar, refills his drink, donald comes over to refill his]

LARRY Hi.

DONALD

... Hi.


ALAN

I really feel terrible—barging in on you fellows this way.

LARRY

[To DONALD]

How've you been?

DONALD

Fine, thanks.

HANK

[To alan] „. . Oh, that's okay.

DONALD

[To LARRY]

... And you?

LARRY

Oh ... just fine.

ALAN

[To hank] You're married?

[ larry hears this, turns to look in the direction of the couch. Michael enters from the kitchen]

HANK

[Watching larry and donald] What?

ALAN

I see you're married.

[Points to hank's wedding band]



HANK Oh.

MICHAEL

[Glaring at donald] Yes. Hank's married.

ALAN

You have any kids?

HANK

Yes. Two. A boy nine, and a girl seven. You should see my boy play tennis—really puts his dad to shame.

DONALD

[Avoiding Michael's eyes] I better get some ice.

[Exits to the kitchen]

ALAN

[To hank] I have two kids too. Both girls.

HANK

Great.

MICHAEL

How are the girls, Alan?

ALAN

Oh, just sensational.

[Shakes his head] They're something, those kids. God, I'm nuts about them.

HANK

How long have you been married?



ALAN

Nine years. Can you believe it, Mickey?

MICHAEL

No.

T

ALAN

Mickey used to go with my wife when we were all in school.

MICHAEL

Can you believe that?

ALAN

[To hank] You live in the city?

LABRY

Yes, we do.

[ larry comes over to couch next to hank]

ALAN Oh.

HANK

I'm in the process of getting a divorce. Larry and I are-roommates.

MICHAEL

Yes.

ALAN

Oh. I'm sorry. Oh, I mean ...

HANK

I understand.



ALAN

[Gets up] I... I ... I think I'd like another drink ... if I may.

MICHAEL

Of course. What was it?

ALAN

I'll do it... if I may.

[Gets up, starts for the bar. Suddenly there is a loud crash offstage, alan jumps, looks toward swinging door]

What was that?

[donald enters with the ice bucket]

MICHAEL

Excuse me. Testy temperament out in the kitch!

[michael exits through the swinging door, alan continues to the bar — starts nervously picking up and putting down bottles, searching for the Scotch]

HANK

[To LARRY]

Larry, where do you know that guy from?

LARRY

What guy?

HANK

That guy.

LARRY

I don't know. Around. The bars.

DONALD

Can I help you, Alan?



ALAN

I... I can't seem to find the Scotch.

DONALD

You've got it in your hand.

ALAN

Oh. Of course. How ... stupid of me.

[ donald watches alan fumble with the Scotch bottle and

glass]

DONALD

Why don't you let me do that.

ALAN

[Gratefully hands him both] Thanks.

DONALD

Was it water or soda?

ALAN

Just make it straight—over ice. [michael enters]

MICHAEL

You see, Alan, I told you it wasn't a good time to talk. But we...

ALAN

It doesn't matter. I'll just finish this and go ... [Takes a long swallow]

LARRY

Where can Harold be?



MICHAEL

Oh, he's always late. You know how neurotic he is about going out in public. It takes him hours to get ready.

LARRY

Why is that?

[ emory breezes in with an apron tied around his waist, carrying a stack of plates which he places on a drop-leaf table. michael does an eye roll]

EMORY

Why is what?

LARRY

Why does Harold spend hours getting ready before he can go out?

EMORY

Because she's a sick lady, that's why.

[Exits to the kitchen, alan finishes his drink]

MICHAEL

Alan, as I was about to say, we can go in the bedroom and talk.

ALAN

It really doesn't matter.

MICHAEL

Come on. Bring your drink.

ALAN

I.. . I've finished it.

MICHAEL

Well, make another and bring it upstairs.


[donald picks up the Scotch bottle and pours into the glass alan has in his hand, michael has started for the stairs]

ALAN

[To donald] Thanks.

DONALD

Don t mention it.

ALAN

[To hank] Excuse us. Well be down in a minute.

LARRY

He'll still be here. [A heat ]

MICHAEL

[On the stairs] Go ahead, Alan. I'll be right there.

[alan turns awkwardly, exits to the bedroom, michael goes into the kitchen. A beat]

HANK

[To LARRY]

What was that supposed to mean?

LARRY

What was what supposed to mean?

HANK

You know.



LARRY

You want another beer?

HANK

No. You re jealous, aren't you?

[hank starts to laugh, larry doesn't like it]

LARRY

I'm Larry. You re jealous.

[Crosses to donald] Hey, Donald, where've you been hanging out these days? I haven't seen you in a long time ...

[michael enters to witness this disapprovingly. He turns,

goes up the stairs.

In the bedroom alan is sitting on tlxe edge of the bed.

michael enters, pauses at the mirror to adjust his hair.

Downstairs, hank gets up, exits into the kitchen, donald

and larry move to a corner of the room, sit facing upstage

and talk quietly]

ALAN

[To michael] This is a marvelous apartment.

MICHAEL

It's too expensive. I work to pay rent.

ALAN

What are you doing these days?

MICHAEL

Nothing.

ALAN

Aren't you writing any more?

MICHAEL

I haven't looked at a typewriter since I sold the very very wonderful, very very marvelous screenplay which never got produced.

ALAN

That's right. The last time I saw you, you were on your way to California. Or was it Europe?

MICHAEL

Hollywood. Which is not in Europe, nor does it have anything whatsoever to do with California.

ALAN

I've never been there but I would imagine it's awful. Everyone must be terribly cheap.

MICHAEL

No, not everyone.

[alan laughs. A beat, michael sits on the bed] Alan, I want to try to explain this evening ...

ALAN

What's there to explain? Sometimes you just can't invite everybody to every party and some people take it personally. But I'm not one of them. I should apologize for inviting myself.

MICHAEL

That's not exactly what I meant.

ALAN

Your friends all seem like very nice guys. That Hank is really a very attractive fellow.



MICHAEL

... Yes. He is.

ALAN

We have a lot in common. What's his roommate's name?

MICHAEL

Larry.

ALAN

What does he do?

MICHAEL

He's a commercial artist.

ALAN

I liked Donald too. The only one I didn't care too much for was—what's his name—Emory?

MICHAEL

Yes. Emory.

ALAN

I just can't stand that kind of talk. It just grates on me.

MICHAEL

What kind of talk, Alan?

ALAN

Oh, you know. His brand of humor, I guess.

MICHAEL

He can be really quite funny sometimes.

ALAN

I suppose so. If you find that sort of thing amusing. He just seems like such a goddamn little pansy.

[Silence. A pause] I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean to say that. That's such an awful thing to say about anyone. But you know what I mean, Michael—you have to admit he is effeminate.

MICHAEL

He is a bit.

ALAN

A bit! He's like a ... a butterfly in heat! I mean, there's no wonder he was trying to teach you all a dance. He probably wanted to dance with you!

[Pause] Oh, come on, man, you know me—you know how I feel— your private life is your own affair.

MICHAEL

[Icy] No. I don't know that about you.

ALAN

I couldn't care less what people do—as long as they don't do it in public—or—or try to force their ways on the whole damned world.

MICHAEL

Alan, what was it you were crying about on the telephone?

ALAN

Oh, I feel like such a fool about that. I could shoot myself for letting myself act that way. I'm so embarrassed I could die.



MICHAEL

But, Alan, if you were genuinely upset—that's nothing to be embarrassed about.

ALAN

All I can say is—please accept my apology for making such an ass of myself.

MICHAEL

You must have been upset or you wouldn't have said you were and that you wanted to see me— had to see me and had to talk to me.

ALAN

Can you forget it? Just pretend it never happened. I know I have. Okay?

MICHAEL

Is something wrong between you and Fran?

ALAN

Listen, I've really got to go.

MICHAEL

Why are you in New York?

ALAN

I'm dreadfully late for dinner.

MICHAEL

Whose dinner? Where are you going?

ALAN

Is this the loo?


MICHAEL

Yes.

ALAN

Excuse me.

[Quickly goes into the bathrom, closes the door, michael remains silent — sits on the bed, stares into space. Downstairs, emory pops in from the kitchen to discover donald and larry in quiet, intimate conversation]

EMORY

What's-going-on-in-here-oh-Mary-don't-ask!

[Puts a salt cellar and pepper mill on the table.

hank enters, carrying a bottle of red wine and a corkscrew.

Looks toward larry and donald. donald sees him, stands

up]

DONALD

Hank, why don't you come and join us?

HANK

That's an interesting suggestion. Whose idea is that?

DONALD

Mine.

LARRY

[To hank] He means in a conversation.

[bernard enters from the kitchen, carrying four wine glasses]

EMORY

[To Bernard] Where're the rest of the wine glasses?



BERNARD

Ahz workin' as fas' as ah can!

EMORY

They have to be told everything. Can't let 'em out of your sight.

[Breezes out to the kitchen.

donald leaves larry's side and goes to tlie coffee table,

helps himself to the cracked crab, hank opens the wine,

puts it on the table.

michael gets up from the bed and goes down the stairs.

Downstairs, hank crosses to larry]

hank I thought maybe you were abiding by the agreement.

LARRY

We have no agreement.

hank We did.

LARRY

You did. I never agreed to anything!

[donald looks up to see michael. raises a crab claw toward him]

DONALD

To your health.

MICHAEL

Up yours.

DONALD

Up my health?


BERNARD

Where's the gent?

MICHAEL

In the gent's room. If you can all hang on for five more minutes, he's about to leave.

[The door buzzes, michael crosses to it]

LARRY

Well, at last!

[michael opens the door to reveal a muscle-hound young man wearing hoots, tight Levi's, a calico neckerchief, and a cowboy hat. Around his wrist there is a large card tied with a ribbon]

COWBOY

[Singing fast] "Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday, dear Harold. Happy birthday to you."

[And with that, he throws his arms around michael and

gives him a big kiss on the lips. Everyone stands in stunned

silence]

MICHAEL

Who the hell are you?

[ emory swings in from the kitchen]

EMORY

She's Harolds present from me and she's early!

[Quick, to cowboy] And that's not even Harold, you idiot!

COWBOY

You said whoever answered the door.



EMORY

But not until midnight! [Quickly, to group] He's supposed to be a midnight cowboy!

DONALD

He is a midnight cowboy.

MICHAEL

He looks right out of a William Inge play to me.

EMORY

[To cowboy] . . . Not until midnight and you're supposed to sing to the right person, for Chrissake! I told you Harold has very, very tight, tight, black curly hair.

[Referring to michael] This number's practically bald!

MICHAEL

Thank you and fuck you.

BERNARD

It's a good thing I didn't open the door.

EMORY

Not that tight and not that black.

COWBOY

I forgot. Besides, I wanted to get to the bars by midnight.

MICHAEL

He's a class act all the way around.



EMORY

What do you mean—get to the bars! Sweetie, I paid you for the whole night, remember?

COWBOY

I hurt my back doing my exercises and I wanted to get to bed early tonight.

BERNARD

Are you ready for this one?

LARRY

[To cowboy] That's too bad, what happened?

COWBOY

I lost my grip doing, my ehin-ups and I fell on my heels and twisted my back.

EMORY

You shouldn't wear heels when you do chin-ups.

COWBOY

[Oblivious] I shouldn't do chin-ups—I got a weak grip to begin with.

EMORY

A weak grip. In my day it used to be called a limp wrist.

BERNARD

Who can remember that far back?

MICHAEL

Who was it that always used to say, "You show me Oscar V/ilde in a cowboy suit, and 111 show you a gay caballero."



DONALD

I don t know. Who was it who always used to say that?

MICHAEL

[Katharine Hepburn voice] I don't know. Somebody.

LARRY

[To cowboy] What does your card say?

COWBOY

[Holds up his wrist] Here. Read it.

LARRY

[Reading card] "Dear Harold, bang, bang, you're alive. But roll over and play dead. Happy birthday, Emory/*

BERNARD

Ah, sheer poetry, Emmy.

LARRY

And in your usual good taste.

MICHAEL

Yes, so conservative of you to resist a sign in Times Square.

EMORY

[Glancing toward stairs] Cheese it! Here comes the socialite nun.

MICHAEL

Goddammit, Emory!



[alan comes down the stairs into the room. Everybody quiets]

ALAN

Well, I'm off.... Thanks, Michael, for the drink.

MICHAEL

You're entirely welcome, Alan. See you tomorrow?

ALAN

. . . No. No, I think I'm going to be awfully busy. I may even go back to Washington.

EMORY

Got a heavy date in Lafayette Square?

ALAN

What?

HANK

Emory.

EMORY

Forget it.

ALAN

[Sees cowboy] Are you ... Harold?

EMORY

No, he's not Harold. He's for Harold.

[Silence, alan lets it pass. Turns to hank]

ALAN

Goodbye, Hank. It was nice to meet you.



HANK

Same here.

[They shake Jiands]

ALAN

If ... if you're ever in Washington—I'd like for you to meet my wife.

LARRY

That'd be fun, wouldn't it, Hank.

EMORY

Yeah, they'd love to meet him— her. I have such a problem with pronouns.

ALAN

[Quick, to EMORY]

How many esses are there in the word pronoun?

EMORY

How'd you like to kiss my ass—that's got two or more essessss in it!

ALAN

How'd you like to blow me!

EMORY

What's the matter with your wife, she got lockjaw?

ALAN

[Lashes out] Faggot, fairy, pansy ...

[Lunges at emory] . . . queer, cocksucker! I'll kill you, you goddamn little mincing swish! You goddamn freak! FREAK! FREAK!

[Pandemonium.

alan heats emory to the floor before anyone recovers from surprise and reacts]

EMORY

Oh, my God, somebody help me! Bernard! He's killing me! [bernard and hank rush forward, emory is screaming. Blood gushes from his nose]

HANK

Alan! ALAN! ALAN!

EMORY

Get him off me! Get him off me! Oh, my God, he's broken my nose! I'm BLEEDING TO DEATH!

[ Larry has gone to shut ilxe door.

With one great, athletic move, hank forcefully tears alan off emory and drags him backward across the room. Bernard bends over emory, puts his arm around him and lifts him]

BERNARD

Somebody get some ice! And a cloth!

[ larry runs to the bar, grabs the bar towel and the ice bucket, rushes to put it on the floor beside Bernard and emory. bernabd quickly wraps some ice in the towel, holds it to emory's mouth]

EMORY

Oh, my face!

BERNARD

He busted your lip, that's all. It'll be all right.

[hank has gotten alan down on the floor on the opposite side of the room, alan relinquishes the struggle, collapses against hank, moaning and beating his fists rhythmically against hank's chest .



michael is still standing in the same spot in the center of the room, immobile, donald crosses past the cowboy]

DONALD

[To cowboy]

Would you mind waiting over there with the gifts.

[cowboy moves over to where the gift-wrapped packages have been put. donald continues past to observe the mayhem, turns up his glass, takes a long swallow. The door buzzes, donald turns toward michael, waits. michael doesn't move, donald goes to the door, opens it to reveal harold]

Well, Harold! Happy birthday. You're just in time for the

floor show, which, as you see, is on the floor. [To cowboy]

Hey, you, this is Harold!

[harold looks blankly toward michael. michael looks back blankly]

cowboy

[Crossing to harold] "Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday, dear Harold. Happy birthday to you."

[Throws his arms around harold and gives him a big kiss.

donald looks toward michael, who observes this stoically.

harold breaks away from cowboy, reads the card, begins

to laugh.

michael turns to survey the room, donald watches him.

Slowly michael begins to move. Walks over to the bar,

pours a glass of gin, raises it to his lips, downs it all. donald

watches silently as harold laughs and laughs and laughs]

Curtain



A moment later, harold is still laughing. Michael, still at the bar, lowers his glass, turns to harold.

MICHAEL

What's so fucking funny?

HAROLD

[Unintimidated. Quick hand to hip] Life. Life is a goddamn laff-riot. You remember life.

MICHAEL

You're stoned. It shows in your arm.

LARRY

Happy birthday, Harold.

MICHAEL

[To harold] You're stoned and you're late! You were supposed to arrive at this location at approximately eight-thirty dash nine o'clock!

HAROLD

What I am, Michael, is a thirty-two-year-old, ugly, pockmarked Jew fairy—and if it takes me a while to pull myself together and if I smoke a little grass before I can get up the nerve to show this face to the world, it's nobody's goddamn business but my own.

[Instant switch to chatty tone] And how are you this evening?

[hank lifts alan to the couch. Michael turns away from

harold, pours himself another drink, donald watches.

harold sweeps past Michael over to where Bernard is



helping emory up off the floor, larry returns the bucket to the bar. michael puts some ice in his drink]

EMORY

Happy birthday, Hallie.

HAROLD

What happened to you?

EMORY

[Groans] Don't ask!

HAROLD

Your lips are turning blue; you look like you been rimming a snowman.

EMORY

That piss-elegant kooze hit me!

[Indicates alan. harold looks toward the couch, alan has slumped his head forward into his own lap]

MICHAEL

Careful, Emory, that kind of talk just makes him s nervous. [alan covers his ears with his hands]

HAROLD

Who is she? Who was she? Who does she hope to be?

EMORY

Who knows, who cares!

hank His name is Alan McCarthy.



MICHAEL

Do forgive me for not formally introducing you.

HAROLD

[Sarcastically, to michael] Not the famous college chum.

MICHAEL

[Takes an ice cube out of his glass, throws it at harold] Do a figure eight on that.

HAROLD

Well, well, well. I finally get to meet dear ole Alan after all these years. And in black tie too. Is this my surprise from you, Michael?

LARRY

I think Alan is the one who got the surprise.

DONALD

And, if you'll notice, he's absolutely speechless.

EMORY

I hope she's in shock! She's a beast!

COWBOY

[Indicating alan] Is it his birthday too?

EMORY

[Indicates cowboy to harold] That's your surprise.

LARRY

Speaking of beasts.


EMORY

From me to you, darlm. How do you like it?

HAROLD

Oh, I suppose he has an interesting face and body—but it turns me right off because he can't talk intelligently about art.

EMORY

Yeah, ain't it a shame.

HAROLD

I could never love anyone like that.

EMORY

Never. Who could?

HAROLD

I could and you could, that's who could! Oh, Mary, she's gorgeous!

EMORY

She may be dumb, but she's all yours!

HAROLD

In affairs of the heart, there are no rules! Where'd you ever find him?

EMORY

Rae knew where.

MICHAEL

[To donald] Rae is Rae Clark. That's R-A-E. She's Emory's dike friend who sings at a place in the Village. She wears pin-striped



suits and bills herself "Miss Rae Clark—Songs Tailored To Your Taste."

EMORY

Miss Rae Clark. Songs tailored to your taste!

MICHAEL

Have you ever heard of anything so crummy in your life?

EMORY

Rae's a fabulous chanteuse. I adore the way she does: "Down in the Depths on the Ninetieth Floor."

MICHAEL

The faggot national anthem.

[Exits to the kitchen singing "Down in the Depths" in a hutch baritone]

HAROLD

[To emory] All I can say is thank God for Miss Rae Clark. I think my present is a super-surprise. I'm so thrilled to get it I'd kiss you but I don't want to get blood all over me.

EMORY

Ohhh, look at my sweater!

HAROLD

Wait'll you see your face.

BERNARD

Come on, Emory, let's clean you up. Happy birthday, Harold.

HAROLD

[Smiles] Thanks, love.


EMORY

My sweater is ruined!

MICHAEL

[From the kitchen] Take one of mine in the bedroom.

DONALD

The one on the floor is vicuna.

BERNARD

[To emory] You'll feel better after I bathe your face.

EMORY

Cheer-up-things-could-get-worse-I-did-and-they-did. [bernard leads emory up the stairs]

HAROLD

Just another birthday party with the folks.

[michael returns with a wine bottle and a green-crystal white-wine glass, pouring en route]

MICHAEL

Here's a cold bottle of Pouilly-Fuisse I bought especially for you, kiddo.

HAROLD

Pussycat, all is forgiven. You can stay. No. You can stay, but not all is forgiven. Cheers.

MICHAEL

I didn't want it this way, Hallie.



HAROLD

[Indicating alan] Who asked Mr. Right to celebrate my birthday?

DONALD

There are no accidents.

HAROLD

[Referring to donald] And who asked him?

MICHAEL

Guilty again. When I make problems for myself, I go the whole route.

HAROLD

Always got to have your crutch, haven't you.

DONALD

I'm not leaving.

[Goes to the bar, makes himself another martini]

HAROLD

Nobody ever thinks completely of somebody else. They always please themselves; they always cheat, if only a little bit.

LARRY

[Referring to alan] Why is he sitting there with his hands over his ears?

DONALD

I think he has an ick.

[donald looks at michael. michael returns the look, steely]



HANK

[To alan] Can I get you a drink?

LARRY

How can he hear you, dummy, with his hands over his ears?

HAROLD

He can hear every word. In fact, he wouldn't miss a word if it killed him.

[alan removes his hands from his ears] What'd I tell you?

ALAN

I . . . I . . . feel sick. I think . . . I'm going to . . . throw up.

HAROLD

Say that again and I won't have to take my appetite depressant.

[alan looks desperately toward hank]

HANK

Hang on.

[hank pulls alan's arm around his neck, lifts him up, takes him up the stairs]

HAROLD

Easy does it. One step at a time.

[bernard and emory come out of the bath]

BERNARD

There. Feel better?



EMORY

Oh, Maiy, what would I do without you?

[emory looks at himself in the mirror] I am not ready for my close-up, Mr. De Mille. Nor will I be for the next two weeks.

[bernard picks up Michael's sweater off the floor, hank and

alan are midway up the stairs]

ALAN

I'm going to throw up! Let me go! Let me go!

[Tears loose of hank, bolts up the remainder of the stairs. He and emory meet head-on. emory screams]

EMORY

Oh, my God, he's after me again!

[emory recoils as alan whizzes past into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. hank has reached the bedroom]

hank He's sick.

BERNARD

Yeah, sick in the head. Here, Emory, put this on.

EMORY

Oh, Mary, take me home. My nerves can't stand any more of this tonight.

[emory takes the vicuna sweater from Bernard, starts to put

it on.

Downstairs, harold flamboyantly takes out a cigarette,

takes a kitchen match from a striker, steps up on the seat

of the couch and sits on the back of it]

HAROLD

Turning on!



[With that, he strikes the match on the sole of his shoe and lights up. Through a strained throat] Anybody care to join me?

[Waves the cigarette in a slow pass]

MICHAEL

Many thanks, no.

[harold passes it to larry, who nods negatively]

DONALD

No, thank you.

HAROLD

[To cowboy] How about you, Tex?

COWBOY

Yeah.

[cowboy takes the cigarette, makes some audible inhalations through his teeth]

MICHAEL

I find the sound of the ritual alone utterly humiliating. [Turns away, goes to the bar, makes another drink]

LARRY

I hate the smell poppers leave on your fingers.

HAROLD

Why don't you get up and wash your hands? [emory and Bernard come down the stairs]

EMORY

Michael, I left the casserole in the oven. You can take it out any time.



MICHAEL

You're not going.

EMORY

I couldn't eat now anyway.

HAROLD

Well, I'm absolutely ravenous. I'm going to eat until I have

a fat attack.

MICHAEL

[To emory] I said, you're not going.

HAROLD

[To michael] Having a cocktail this evening, are we? In my honor?

EMORY

It's your favorite dinner, Hallie. I made it myself.

BERNARD

Who fixed the casserole?

EMORY

Well, I made the sauce!

BERNARD

Well, I made the salad!

LARRY

Girls, please.

MICHAEL

Please what!


HAROLD

Beware the hostile fag. When he's sober, he's dangerous. When he drinks, he's lethal.

MICHAEL

[Referring to harold] Attention must not be paid.

HAROLD

I'm starved, Em, I'm ready for some of your Alice B. Toklas' opium-baked lasagna.

EMORY

Are you really? Oh, that makes me so pleased maybe I'll just serve it before I leave.

MICHAEL

You re not leaving.

RERNARD

I'll help.

LARRY

I better help too. We don't need a nose-bleed in the lasagna.

RERNARD

When the sauce is on it, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference anyway.

[emory, Bernard, and larry exit to the kitchen]

MICHAEL

[Proclamation] Nobody's going anywhere!



HAROLD

You are going to have schmertz tomorrow you wouldn't believe.

MICHAEL

May I kiss the hem of your schmata, Doctor Freud?

COWBOY

What are you two talking about? I don't understand.

DONALD

He's working through his Oedipus complex, sugar. With a machete.

COWBOY

Huh?

[hank comes down the stairs]

HANK

Michael, is there any air spray?

HAROLD

Hair spray! You're supposed to be holding his head, not doing his hair.

HANK

Air spray, not hair spray.

MICHAEL

There's a can of floral spray right on top of the John.

HANK

Thanks.

[hank goes back upstairs]



HAROLD

[To michael] Aren't you going to say "If it was a snake, it would have bitten you."

MICHAEL

[Indicating cowboy] That is something only your friend would say.

HAROLD

[To michael] I am turning on and you are just turning.

[To DONALD]

I keep my grass in the medicine cabinet. In a Band-Aid box. Somebody told me it's the safest place. If the cops arrive, you can always lock yourself in the bathroom and flush it down the John.

DONALD

Very cagey.

HAROLD

It makes more sense than where I tvas keeping it—in an oregano jar in the spice rack. I kept forgetting and accidentally turning my hateful mother on with the salad.

[A beat] But I think she liked it. No matter what meal she comes over for—even if it's breakfast—she says, "Let's have a salad!"

COWROY

[To michael] Why do you say I would say "If it was a snake, it would have bitten you." I think that's what I would have said.

MICHAEL

Of course you would have, baby. That's the kind of remark your pint-size brain thinks of. You are definitely the type who still moves his lips when he reads and who sits in a steam room and says things like "Hot enough for you?"

COWBOY

I never use the steam room when I go to the gym. It's bad after a workout. It flattens you down.

MICHAEL

Just after you've broken your back to blow yourself up like a poisoned dog.

COWBOY

Yeah.

MICHAEL

You're right, Harold. Not only can he not talk intelligently about art, he can't even follow from one sentence to the next.

HAROLD

But he's beautiful. He has unnatural natural beauty.

[Quick palm upheld] Not that that means anything.

MICHAEL

It doesn't mean everything.

HAROLD

Keep telling yourself that as your hair drops out in handfuls.

[Quick palm upheld] Not that it's not natural for one's hair to recede as one reaches seniority. Not that those wonderful lines that have begun creasing our countenances don't make all the difference in the world because they add so much character.

MICHAEL

Faggots are worse than women about their age. They think their lives are over at thirty. Physical beauty is not that goddamned important!

HAROLD

Of course not. How could it be—it's only in the eye of the beholder.

MICHAEL

And it's only skin deep—don't forget that one.

HAROLD

Oh, no, I haven't forgotten that one at all. It's only skin deep and it's transitory too. It's terribly transitory. I mean, how long does it last—thirty or forty or fifty years at the most— depending on how well you take care of yourself. And not counting, of course, that you might die before it runs out anyway. Yes, it's too bad about this poor boy's face. It's tragic. He's absolutely cursed!

[Takes cowboy's face in his hands] How can his beauty ever compare with my soul? And although I have never seen my soul, I understand from my mother's rabbi that it's a knockout. I, however, cannot seem to locate it for a gander. And if I could, I'd sell it in a flash for some skin-deep, transitory, meaningless beauty!

[alan walks weakly into the bedroom and sits on the bed.

Downstairs, larry enters from the kitchen with salad plates.

hank comes into the bedroom and turns out the lamps, alan

lies down. Now only the light from the bathroom and the

stairwell illuminate the room]



MICHAEL

[Makes sign of the cross with his drink in hand] Forgive him, Father, for he know not what he do. [hank stands still in the half darkness]

HAROLD

Michael, you kill me. You don't know what side of the fence you're on. If somebody says something pro-religion, you're against them. If somebody denies God, you're against them. One might say that you have some problem in that area. You can't live with it and you can't live without it.

[ emory barges through the swinging door, carrying the casserole]

EMORY

Hot stuff! Comin' through!

MICHAEL

[To emory] One could murder you with very little effort.

HAROLD

[To michael] You hang on to that great insurance policy called The Church.

MICHAEL

That's right. I believe in God, and if it turns out that there really isn't one, okay. Nothing lost. But if it turns out that there is —I'm covered.

[bernard enters, carrying a huge salad bowl. He puts it

down, lights table candles]

EMORY

[To MICHAEL]

Harriet Hypocrite, that's who you are.



MICHAEL

Right. I'm one of those truly rotten Catholics who gets drunk, sins all night and goes to Mass the next morning.

EMORY

Gilda Guilt. It depends on what you think sin is.

MICHAEL

Would you just shut up your goddamn minty mouth and get back to the goddamn kitchen!

EMORY

Say anything you want— just don't hit me! [Exits. A beat]

MICHAEL

Actually, I suppose Emory has a point—I only go to confession before I get on a plane.

BERNARD

Do you think God's power only exists at thirty thousand feet?

MICHAEL

It must. On the ground, I am God. In the air, I'm just one more scared son of a bitch.

[A beat]

BERNARD

I'm scared on the ground.

COWBOY

Me, too.

[A beat] That is, when I'm not high on pot or up on acid.

[hank comes down the stairs]



LARRY

[To hank] Well, is it bigger than a breadstick?

HANK

[Ignores last remark. To michael] He's lying down for a minute.

HAROLD

How does the bathroom smell?

HANK

Better.

MICHAEL

Before it smelled like somebody puked. Now it smells like somebody puked in a gardenia patch.

LARRY

And how does the big hero feel?

HANK

Lay off, will you.

[emory enters with a basket of napkin-covered rolls, deposits them on the table]

EMORY

Dinner is served!

[ harold comes to the buffet table]

HAROLD

Emory, it looks absolutely fabulous.

EMORY

I'd make somebody a good wife.


[emory serves pasta. Bernard serves the salad, pours wine.

michael goes to the bar, makes another drink] I could cook and do an apartment and entertain . . .

[Grabs a long-stem rose from an arrangement on the table,

clenches it between his teeth, snaps his fingers and strikes

a pose] Kiss me quick, I'm Carmen!

[harold just looks at him blankly, passes on. emory takes

the flower out of his mouth] One really needs castanets for that sort of thing.

MICHAEL

And a getaway car.

[hank comes up to the table]

EMORY

What would you like, big boy?

LARRY

Alan McCarthy, and don't hold the mayo.

EMORY

I can't keep up with you two—

[Indicating hank, then larry] —I thought you were mad at him—now he's bitchin' you. What gives?

LARRY

Never mind.

[cowboy comes over to the table, emory gives him a plate of food. Bernard gives him salad and a glass of wine. hank moves to the couch, sits and puts his plate and glass on the coffee table. harold moves to sit on the stairs and eat]

COWBOY

What is it?



LARRY

Lasagna.

COWBOY

It looks like spaghetti and meatballs sorta flattened out.

DONALD

It's been in the steam room.

COWBOY

It has?

MICHAEL

[Contemptuously] It looks like spaghetti and meatballs sorta flattened out. Ah, yes, Harold—truly enviable.

HAROLD

As opposed to you who knows so much about haute cuisine.

[A beat] Raconteur, gourmet, troll.

[ larry takes a plate of food, goes to sit on the back of the

couch from behind it]

COWBOY

It's good.

HAROLD

[Quick] You like it, eat it.

MICHAEL

Stuff your mouth so that you cant say anything. [ donald takes a plate]



HAROLD

Turning.

BERNARD

[To donald] Wine?

DONALD

No, thanks.

MICHAEL

Aw, go on, ldddo, force yourself. Have a little vin ordinaire to wash down all that depressed pasta.

HAROLD

Sommelier, connoisseur, pig.

[ donald takes the glass of wine, moves up by the bar, puts the glass of wine on it, leans against the wall, eats his food. emory hands Bernard a plate]

BERNARD

[To emory] Aren't you going to have any?

EMORY

No. My lip hurts too much to eat.

MICHAEL

[Crosses to table, picks up knife] I hear if you puts a knife under de bed it cuts de pain.

HAROLD

[To MICHAEL]

I hear if you put a knife under your chin it cuts your throat.

EMORY

Anybody going to take a plate up to Alan?



MICHAEL

The punching bag has now dissolved into Flo Nightingale.

LARRY

Hank?

HANK

I don't think he'd have any appetite.

[alan, as if he's heard his name, gets up from the bed, moves slowly to the top of the stairwell. Bernard takes his plate, moves near the stairs, sits on the floor, michael raps the knife on an empty wine glass]

MICHAEL

Ladies and gentlemen. Correction: Ladies and ladies, I would like to announce that you have just eaten Sebastian Venable.

COWROY

Just eaten what?

MICHAEL

Not what, stupid. Who. A character in a play. A fairy who was eaten alive. I mean the chop-chop variety.

COWROY

Jesus.

HANK

Did Edward Albee write that play?

MICHAEL

No. Tennessee Williams.

HANK

Oh, yeah.


MICHAEL

Albee wrote Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

LARRY

Dummy.

HANK

I know that. I just thought maybe he wrote that other one too.

LARRY

Well, you made a mistake.

HANK

So I made a mistake.

LARRY

That's right, you made a mistake.

HANK

What's the difference? You cant add.

COWBOY

Edward who.

MICHAEL

[To emory] How much did you pay for him?

EMORY

He was a steal.

MICHAEL

He's a ham sandwich—fifty cents any time of the day or night.



HAROLD

King of the Pig People.

[michael gives him a look, donald returns his plate to the table]

EMORY

[To donald] Would you like some more?

DONALD

No, thank you, Emory. It was very good.

EMORY

Did you like it?

COWBOY

I'm not a steal. I cost twenty dollars. [bernard returns his plate]

EMORY

More?

BERNARD

[Nods negatively] It was delicious—even if I did make it myself.

EMORY

Isn't anybody having seconds?

HAROLD

I'm having seconds and thirds and maybe even fifths.

[Gets up off the stairs, comes toward the table] I'm absolutely desperate to keep the weight up.

[bernard bends to whisper something in emory's ear.

emory nods affirmatively and bernard crosses to cowboy

and whispers in his ear. A heat, cowboy returns his plate to the buffet and follows emory and Bernard into the kitchen]

MICHAEL

[Parodying harold] You're absolutely paranoid about absolutely everything.

HAROLD

Oh, yeah, well, why don't you not tell me about it.

MICHAEL

You starve yourself all day, living on coffee and cottage cheese so that you can gorge yourself at one meal. Then you feel guilty and moan and groan about how fat you are and how ugly you are when the truth is you're no fatter or thinner than you ever are.

EMORY

Polly Paranoia.

[emory moves to the coffee table to take hank's empty plate]

HANK

Just great, Emory.

EMORY

Connie Casserole, no-trouble-at-all-oh-Mary, D.A.

MICHAEL

[To harold] ... And this pathological lateness. It's downright crazy.

HAROLD

Turning.



MICHAEL

Standing before a bathroom mirror for hours and hours before you can walk out on the street. And looking no different after Christ knows how many applications of Christ knows how many ointments and salves and creams and masks.

HAROLD

I've got bad skin, what can I tell you.

MICHAEL

Who wouldn't after they deliberately take a pair of tweezers and deliberately mutilate their pores—no wonder you've got holes in your face after the hack job you've done on yourself year in and year out!

HAROLD

[Coolly hut definitely] You hateful sow.

MICHAEL

Yes, you've got scars on your face—but they're not that bad and if you'd leave yourself alone you wouldn't have any more than you've already awarded yourself.

HAROLD

You'd really like me to compliment you now for being so honest, wouldn't you. For being my best friend who will tell me what even my best friends won't tell me. Swine.

MICHAEL

And the pills!

[Announcement to group] Harold has been gathering, saving, and storing up barbitu-


rates for the last year like a goddamn squirrel. Hundreds of Nembutals, hundreds of Seconals. All in preparation for and anticipation of the long winter of his death.

[Silence] But I tell you right now, Hallie. When the time comes, you'll never have the guts. It's not always like it happens in plays, not all faggots bump themselves off at the end of the story.

HAROLD

What you say may be true. Time will undoubtedly tell. But, in the meantime, you've left out one detail—the cosmetics and astringents are paid for, the bathroom is paid for, the tweezers are paid for, and the pills are paid for!

[emory darts in and over to the light switch, plunges the room into darkness except for the light from the tapers on the buffet table, and begins to sing "Happy Birthday." Immediately Bernard pushes the swinging door open and cowboy enters carrying a cake ablaze with candles. Everyone has now joined in with "Happy birthday, dear Harold, happy birthday to you." This is followed by a round of applause. michael turns, goes to the bar, makes another drink]

EMORY

Blow out your candles, Mary, and make a wish!

MICHAEL

[To himself] Blow out your candles, Laura.

[cowboy has brought cake over in front of harold. He thinks a minute, blows out the candles. More applause]

EMORY

Awwww, she's thirty-two years young!



HAROLD

[Groans, holds his head] Ohh, my God!

[bernard has brought in cake plates and forks. The room remains lit only by candlelight from the buffet table, cowboy returns the cake to the table and Bernard begins to cut it and put the pieces on the plates]

HANK

Now you have to open your gifts.

HAROLD

Do I have to open them here?

EMORY

Of course you've got to open them here.

[Hands harold a gift, harold begins to rip the paper off]

HAROLD

Where's the card?

EMORY

Here.

HAROLD

Oh. From Larry.

[Finishes tearing off the paper] It's heaven! Oh, I just love it, Larry.

[harold holds up a graphic design — a large-scale deed to Boardwalk, like those used in a Monopoly game]

COWBOY

What is it?

HAROLD

It's the deed to Boardwalk.



EMORY

Oh, gay pop art!

DONALD

[To larry] It's sensational. Did you do it?

LARRY

Yes.

HAROLD

Oh, it's super, Larry. It goes up the minute I get home.

[harold gives larry a peck on the cheek]

COWROY

[To harold] I don't get it—you cruise Atlantic City or something?

MICHAEL

Will somebody get him out of here!

[harold has torn open another gift, takes the card from inside]

HAROLD

Oh, what a nifty sweater! Thank you, Hank.

HANK

You can take it back and pick out another one if you want to.

HAROLD

I think this one is just nifty.

[donald goes to the bar, makes himself a brandy and soda]

RERNARD

Who wants cake?



EMORY

Everybody?

DONALD

None for me.

MICHAEL

I'd just like to sleep on mine, thank you.

[hank comes over to the table. Bernard gives him a plate of cake, passes another one to cowboy and a third to larry. harold has torn the paper off another gift. Suddenly laughs aloud]

HAROLD

Oh, Bernard! How divine! Look, everybody! Bejeweled knee

pads!

[Holds up a pair of basketball knee pads with sequin initials]

BERNARD

Monogrammed!

EMORY

Bernard, you're a camp!

MICHAEL

Y'all heard of Gloria DeHaven and Billy de Wolfe, well, dis here is Rosemary De Camp!

BERNARD

Who?

EMORY

I never miss a Rosemary De Camp picture.


HANK

I've never heard of her.


COWBOY

Me neither.

HANK

Not all of us spent their childhood in a movie house, Michael. Some of us played baseball.

DONALD

And mowed the lawn.

EMORY

Well, I know who Rosemary De Camp is.

MICHAEL

You would. It's a cinch you wouldn't recognize a baseball or a lawnmower.

[ harold has unwrapped his last gift. He is silent. Pause]

HAROLD

Thank you, Michael.

MICHAEL

What?

[Turns to see the gift] Oh.

[A beat] You're welcome.

[michael finishes off his drink, returns to the bar]

LARRY

What is it, Harold? [A beat]



HAROLD

It's a photograph of him in a silver frame. And there's an inscription engraved and the date.

BERNARD

What's it say?

HAROLD

Just... something personal.

[michael spins round from the bar]

MICHAEL

Hey, Bernard, what do you say we have a little music to liven things up!

BERNARD

Okay.

EMORY

Yeah, I feel like dancing.

MICHAEL

How about something good and ethnic, Emory—one of your specialties, like a military toe tap with sparklers.

EMORY

I don't do that at birthdays—only on the Fourth of July.

[bernard puts on a romantic record, emory goes to Bernard. They start to dance slowly]

LARRY

Come on, Michael.

MICHAEL

I only lead.

LARRY

I can follow.

[They start to dance]

HAROLD

Come on, Tex, you're on.

[cowboy gets to his feet, but is a washout as a dancing partner, rarold gives up, takes out another cigarette, strikes a match. As he does, he catches sight of someone over by the stairs, walks over to alan. Blows out match]

Wanna dance?

EMORY

[Sees alan] Uh-oh. Yvonne the Terrible is back.

MICHAEL

Oh, hello, Alan. Feel better? This is where you came in, isn't it?

[alan starts to cross directly to the door, michael breaks

away] Excuse me, Larry . ..

[alan lias reached the door and has started to open it as

michael intercepts, slams the door with one hand, and

leans against it, crossing his legs] As they say in the Deep South, don't rush off in the heat of the day.

HAROLD

Revolution complete.

[michael slowly takes alan by the arm, walks him slowly back into the room]

MICHAEL

. . . You missed the cake—and you missed the opening of the gifts—but you're still in luck. You're just in time for a party game.



[They have reached the phonograph, michael rejects the record. The music stops, the dancing stops, michael releases alan, claps his hands] ... Hey, everybody! Game time!

[alan starts to move, michael catches him gently by the sleeve]

HAROLD

Why don't you just let him go, Michael?

MICHAEL

He can go if he wants to—but not before we play a little game.

EMORY

What's it going to be—movie-star gin?

MICHAEL

That's too faggy for Alan to play—he wouldn't be any good at it.

BERNARD

What about Likes and Dislikes?

[michael lets go of alan, takes a pencil and pad from the desk]

MICHAEL

It's too much trouble to find enough pencils, and besides, Emory always puts down the same thing. He dislikes artificial fruit and flowers and coffee grinders made into lamps—and he likes Mabel Mercer, poodles, and All About Eve —the screenplay of which he will then recite verbatim.

EMORY

I put down other things sometimes.

MICHAEL

Like a tan out of season?

EMORY

I just always put down little "Chi-Chi" because I adore her so much.

MICHAEL

If one is of the masculine gender, a poodle is the insignia of one's deviation.

BERNARD

You know why old ladies like poodles—because they go down on them.

EMORY

They do not!

LARRY

We could play B for Botticelli.

MICHAEL

We could play Spin the Botticelli, but we're not going to. [A beat]

HAROLD

What would you like to play, Michael—the Truth Game? [micuael chuckles to himself]

MICHAEL

Cute, Hallie.

HAROLD

Or do you want to play Murder? You all remember that one, don't you?



MICHAEL

[To harold] Very, very cute.

DONALD

As I recall, they're quite similar. The rules are the same in both—you kill somebody.

MICHAEL

In affairs of the heart, there are no rules. Isn't that right, Harold?

HAROLD

That's what I always say.

MICHAEL

Well, that's the name of the game. The Affairs of the Heart.

COWBOY

I've never heard of that one.

MICHAEL

Of course you've never heard of it—I just made it up, baby doll. Affairs of the Heart is a combination of both the Truth Game and Murder—with a new twist.

HAROLD

I can hardly wait to find out what that is.

ALAN

Mickey, I'm leaving. [Starts to move]

MICHAEL

[Firmly, flatly] Stay where you are.


HAROLD

Michael, let him go.

MICHAEL

He really doesn't want to. If he did, he'd have left a long time ago—or he wouldn't have come here in the first place.

ALAN

[Holding his forehead] ... Mickey, I don't feel well!

MICHAEL

[Low tone, but distinctly articulate] My name is Michael. I am called Michael. You must never call anyone called Michael Mickey. Those of us who are named Michael are very nervous about it. If you don't believe it—try it.

ALAN

I'm sorry. I can't think.

MICHAEL

You can think. What you can't do—is leave. It's like watching an accident on the highway—you can't look at it and you can't look away.

ALAN

I . . . feel . . . weak . . .

MICHAEL

You are weak. Much weaker than I think you realize.

[Takes alan by the arm, leads him to a chair. Slowly, deliberately, pushes him down into it]

Now! Who's going to play with Alan and me? Everyone?



HAROLD

I have no intention of playing.

DONALD

Nor do I.

MICHAEL

Well, not everyone is a participant in life. There are always those who stand on the sidelines and watch.

LARRY

What's the game?

MICHAEL

Simply this: we all have to call on the telephone the one person we truly believe we have loved.

HANK

I'm not playing.

LARRY

Oh, yes, you are.

HANK

You'd like for me to play, wouldn't you?

LARRY

You bet I would. I like to know who you'd call after all the fancy speeches I've heard lately. Who would you call? Would you call me?

MICHAEL

[To Bernard] Sounds like there's, how you say, trouble in paradise.



HAROLD

If there isn't, I think you'll be able to stir up some.

HANK

And who would you call? Don't think I think for one minute it would be me. Or that one call would do it. You'd have to make several, wouldn't you? About three long-distance and God only knows how many locals.

COWBOY

I'm glad I don't have to pay the bill.

MICHAEL

Quiet!

HAROLD

[Loud whisper to cowboy] Oh, don't worry, Michael won't pay it either.

MICHAEL

Now, here's how it works.

LARRY

I thought you said there were no rules.

MICHAEL

That's right. In Affairs of the Heart, there are no rules. This is the goddamn point system!

[No response from anyone. A heat] If you make the call, you get one point. If the person you are calling answers, you get two more points. If somebody else answers, you get only one. If there's no answer at all, you're screwed.

DONALD

You're screwed if you make the call.



HAROLD

You're a fool —if you screw yourself.

MICHAEL

. . . When you get the person whom you are calling on the line—if you tell them who you are, you get two points. And then—if you tell them that you love them—you get a bonus of five more points!

HAROLD

Hateful.

MICHAEL

Therefore you can get as many as ten points and as few as one.

HAROLD

You can get as few as none—if you know how to work it.

MICHAEL

The one with the highest score wins.

ALAN

Hank. Let's get out of here.

EMORY

Well, now. Did you hear that!

MICHAEL

Just the two of you together. The pals . . . the guys . . . the buddy-buddies . . . the he-men.

EMORY

I think Larry might have something to say about that.



BERNARD

Emory.

MICHAEL

The duenna speaks.

[Crosses to take the telephone from the desk, brings it to

the group] So who's playing? Not including Cowboy, who, as a gift, is neuter. And, of course, le voyeur.

[A beat] Emory? Bernard?

BERNARD

I don't think I want to play.

MICHAEL

Why, Bernard! Where's your fun-loving spirit?

BERNARD

I don't think this game is fun.

HAROLD

It's absolutely hateful.

ALAN

Hank, leave with me.

HANK

You don't understand, Alan. I can't. You can . . . but I can't.

ALAN

Why, Hank? Why can't you?

LARRY

[To hank] If he doesn't understand, why don't you explain it to him?



MICHAEL

I'll explain it.

HAROLD

I had a feeling you might.

MICHAEL

Although I doubt that it'll make any difference. That type refuses to understand that which they do not wish to accept. They reject certain facts. And Alan is decidedly from The Ostrich School of Reality.

[A beat] Alan . . . Larry and Hank are lovers. Not just roommates, bedmates. Lovers.

ALAN

Michael!

MICHAEL

No man's still got a roommate when he's over thirty years old. If they're not lovers, they're sisters.

LARRY

Hank is the one who's over thirty.

MICHAEL

Well, you're pushing it!

ALAN

... Hank? [A beat]

HANK

Yes, Alan. Larry is my lover.



ALAN

But... but. .. you're married.

[michael, larry, emory, and cowboy are sent into instant gales of laughter]

HAROLD

I think you said the wrong thing.

MICHAEL

Don't you love that quaint little idea—if a man is married, then he is automatically heterosexual.

[A beat] Alan—Hank swings both ways—with a definite preference.

[A heat] Now. Who makes the first call? Emory?

EMORY

You go, Bernard.

BERNARD

I don't want to.

EMORY

I don't want to either. I don't want to at all.

DONALD

[To himself] There are no accidents.

MICHAEL

Then, may I say, on your way home I hope you will yourself over an embankment.

EMORY

[To Bernard] Go on. Call up Peter Dahlbeck. That's who you'd like to call, isn't it?

130



MICHAEL

Who is Peter Dahlbeck?

EMORY

The boy in Detroit whose family Bernard's mother has been a laundress for since he was a pickaninny.

BERNARD

I worked for them too—after school and every summer.

EMORY

It's always been a large order of Hero Worship.

BERNARD

I think I've loved him all my life. But he never knew I was alive. Besides, he's straight.

COWBOY

So nothing ever happened between you?

EMORY

Oh, they finally made it—in the pool house one night after a drunken swimming party.

LARRY

With the right wine and the right music there're damn few that aren't curious.

MICHAEL

Sounds like there's a lot of Lady Chatterley in Mr. Dahlbeck, wouldn't you say, Donald?

DONALD

I've never been an O'Hara fan myself.


BERNARD

. . . And afterwards we went swimming in the nude in the dark with only the moon reflecting on the water.

DONALD

Nor Thomas Merton.

BERNARD

It was beautiful.

MICHAEL

How romantic. And then the next morning you took him his coffee and Alka-Seltzer on a tray.

BERNARD

It was in the afternoon. I remember I was worried sick all morning about having to face him. But he pretended like nothing at all had happened.

MICHAEL

Christ, he must have been so drunk he didn't remember a thing.

BERNARD

Yeah. I was sure relieved.

MICHAEL

Odd how that works. And now, for ten points, get that liar on the phone.

[A beat. Bernard picks up the pJwne, dials]

LARRY

You know the number?

BERNARD

Sure. He's back in Grosse Pointe, living at home. He just got separated from his third wife.



[All watch Bernard as he puts the receiver to his ear, waits. A beat. He hangs up quickly]

EMORY

D.A. or B.Y.?

MICHAEL

He didn't even give it time to find out.

[Coaxing] Go ahead, Bernard. Pick up the phone and dial. You'll think of something. You know you want to call him. You know that, don't you? Well, go ahead. Your curiosity has got the best of you now. So ... go on, call him.

[A beat. Bernard picks up the receiver, dials again. Lets it

ring this time]

HAROLD

Hateful.

COWBOY

What's D.A. or B.Y.?

EMORY

That's operator lingo. It means—"Doesn't Answer" or "Busy."

BERNARD

.. . Hello?

MICHAEL

One point.

[Efficiently takes note on the pad]

BERNARD

Who's speaking? Oh ... Mrs. Dahlbeck.


MICHAEL

[Taking note] One point.

BERNARD

. .. It's Bernard—Francine's boy.

EMORY

Son, not boy.

BERNARD

. . . How are you? Good. Good. Oh, just fine, thank you. Mrs. Dahlbeck . . . is . . . Peter ... at home? Oh. Oh, I see.

MICHAEL

[Shakes his head] Shhhhiiii. . .

BERNARD

. . . Oh, no. No, it's nothing important. I just wanted to . . . to tell him . . . that ... to tell him I . . . I . . .

MICHAEL

[Prompting flatly] I love him. That I've always loved him.

BERNARD

. . . that I was sorry to hear about him and his wife.

MICHAEL

No points!

BERNARD

. . . My mother wrote me. Yes. It is. It really is. Well. Would you just tell him I called and said . . . that I was . . . just



. . . very, very sorry to hear and I . . . hope . . . they can get everything straightened out. Yes. Yes. Well, good night. Goodbye.

[Hangs up slowly, michael draws a definite line across his

pad, makes a definite period]

MICHAEL

Two points total. Terrible. Next!

[michael whisks the phone out of Bernard's hands, gives it to EMORY]

EMORY

Are you all right, Bernard?

BERNARD

[Almost to himself] Why did I call? Why did I do that?

LARRY

[To Bernard] Where was he?

BERNARD

Out on a date.

MICHAEL

Come on, Emory. Punch in.

[emory picks up the phone, dials information. A beat]

EMORY

Could I have the number, please—in the Bronx—for a Del-bert Botts.

LARRY

A Delbert Botts! How many can there be!



BERNARD

Oh, I wish I hadn't called now.

EMORY

... No, the residence number, please.

[Waves his hand at michael, signaling for the pencil.

michael hands it to him. He writes on the white, plastic

phone case] ... Thank you.

[A beat. And he indignantly slams down the receiver] I do wish information would stop calling me "Ma'am"!

MICHAEL

By all means, scribble all over the telephone. [Snatclies the pencil from emory's hands]

EMORY

It comes off with a little spit.

MICHAEL

Like a lot of things.

LARRY

Who the hell is Delbert Botts?

EMORY

The one person I have always loved.

[To michael] That's who you said call, isn't it?

MICHAEL

That's right, Emory board.

LARRY

How could you love anybody with a name like that?



MICHAEL

Yes, Emory, you couldn't love anybody with a name like that. It wouldn't look good on a place card. Isn't that right. Alan?

[michael slaps alan on the shoulder, alan is silent.

michael snickers]

EMORY

I admit his name is not so good—but he is absolutely beautiful. At least, he was when I was in high school. Of course, I haven't seen him since and he was about seven years older than I even then.

MICHAEL

Christ, you better call him quick before he dies.

EMORY

I've loved him ever since the first day I laid eyes on him, which was when I was in the fifth grade and he was a senior. Then, he went away to college and by the time he got out I was in high school, and he had become a dentist.

MICHAEL

[With incredulous disgust] A dentist!

EMORY

Yes. Delbert Botts, D.D.S. And he opened his office in a bank building.

HAROLD

And you went and had every tooth in your head pulled out, right?

EMORY

No. I just had my teeth cleaned, that's all.

[ donald turns from the bar with two drinks in his hands]

BERNARD

[To himself] Oh, I shouldn't have called.

MICHAEL

Will you shut up, Bernard! And take your boring, sleep-making icks somewhere else. Go!

[michael extends a pointed finger toward the steps. Bernard takes the wine bottle and his glass and moves toward the stairs, pouring himself another drink on the way]

EMORY

I remember I looked right into his eyes the whole time and I kept wanting to bite his fingers.

HAROLD

Well, it's absolutely mind boggling.

MICHAEL

Phyllis Phallic.

HAROLD

It absolutely boggles the mind.

[donald brings one of the drinks to alan. alan takes it, drinks it down]

MICHAEL

[Referring to donald] Sara Samaritan.

EMORY

... I told him I was having my teeth cleaned for the Junior-



Senior Prom, for which I was in charge of decorations. I told him it was a celestial theme and I was cutting stars out of tin foil and making clouds out of chicken wire and angel's-hair.

[A beat] He couldn't have been less impressed.

COWBOY

I got angel's-hair down my shirt once at Christmas time. Gosh, did it itch!

EMORY

... I told him I was going to burn incense in pots so that white fog would hover over the dance floor and it would look like heaven—just like I'd seen it in a Rita Hayworth movie. I can't remember the title.

MICHAEL

The picture was called Down to Earth. Any kid knows that.

COWBOY

. . . And it made little tiny cuts in the creases of my fingers. Man, did they sting! It would be terrible if you got that stuff in your...

[michael circles slowly toward him] I'll be quiet.

EMORY

He was engaged to this stupid-ass girl named Loraine whose mother was truly Supercunt.

MICHAEL

Don't digress.


EMORY

Well, anyway, I was a wreck. I mean a total mess. I couldn't eat, sleep, stand up, sit down, nothing. I could hardly cut out silver stars or finish the clouds for the prom. So I called him on the telephone and asked if I could see him alone.

HAROLD

Clearly not the coolest of moves.

[donald looks at alan. alan looks away]

EMORY

He said okay and told me to come by his house. I was so nervous my hands were shaking and my voice was unsteady. I couldn't look at him this time—I just stared straight in space and blurted out why I'd come. I told him ... I wanted him to be my friend. I said that I had never had a friend who I could talk to and tell everything and trust. I asked him if he would be my friend.

COWBOY

You poor bastard.

MICHAEL

Shhhhhh!

BERNARD

What'd he say?

EMORY

He said he would be glad to be my friend. And any time I ever wanted to see him or call him—to just call him and he'd see me. And he shook my trembling wet hand and I left on a cloud.



MICHAEL

One of the ones you made yourself.

EMORY

And the next day I went and bought him a gold-plated cigarette lighter and had his initials monogrammed on it and wrote a card that said "From your friend, Emory."

HAROLD

Seventeen years old and already big with the gifts.

COWBOY

Yeah. And cards too.

EMORY

.. . And then the night of the prom I found out.

BERNARD

Found out what?

EMORY

I heard two girls I knew giggling together. They were standing behind some goddamn corrugated cardboard Greek columns I had borrowed from a department store and had draped with yards and yards of goddamn cheesecloth. Oh, Mary, it takes a fairy to make something pretty.

MICHAEL

Dont digress.

EMORY

This girl who was telling the story said she had heard it from her mother—and her mother had heard it from Loraine's mother.


[To michael] You see, Loraine and her mother were not beside the point.

[Back to the group] Obviously, Del had told Loraine about my calling and about the gift.

[A beat] Pretty soon everybody at the dance had heard about it and they were laughing and making jokes. Everybody knew I had a crush on Doctor Delbert Botts and that I had asked him to be my friend.

[A beat] What they didn't know was that I loved him. And that I would go on loving him years after they had all forgotten my funny secret.

[Pause]

HAROLD

Well, I for one need an insulin injection.

MICHAEL

Call him.

BERNARD

Don't, Emory.

MICHAEL

Since when are you telling him what to do!

EMORY

[To Bernard] What do I care—I'm pissed! I'll do anything. Three times.

BERNARD

Don't. Please!



MICHAEL

I said call him.

BERNARD

Don't! You'll be sorry. Take my word for it.

EMORY

What have I got to lose?

BERNARD

Your dignity. That's what you've got to lose.

MICHAEL

Well, that's a knee-slapper! I love your telling him about dignity when you allow him to degrade you constantly by Uncle Tom-ing you to death.

BERNARD

He can do it, Michael. I can do it. But you cant do it.

MICHAEL

Isn't that discrimination?

BERNARD

I don't like it from him and I don't like it from me—but I do it to myself and I let him do it. I let him do it because it's the only thing that, to him, makes him my equal. We both got the short end of the stick—but I got a hell of a lot more than he did and he knows it. I let him Uncle Tom me just so he can tell himself he's not a complete loser.

MICHAEL

How very considerate.


BERNARD

Its his defense. You have your defense, Michael. But it's indescribable.

[emory quietly licks his finger and begins to rub the number off the telephone case]

MICHAEL

[To Bernard] Tall want to hear a little polite parlor jest from the liberal Deep South? Do you know why Nigras have such big lips? Because they're always going "P-p-p-p-a-a-a-h!"

[The labial noise is exasperating with lazy disgust as he shuffles about the room]

DONALD

Christ, Michael!

MICHAEL

[Unsuccessfully irks to tear the phone away from emory] I can do without your goddamn spit all over my telephone, you nellie coward.

EMORY

I may be neJlie ? but I'm no coward.

[Starts to dial] Bernard, forgive me. I'm sorry. I won't ever say those things to you again.

[michael watches triumphant. Bernard pours another glass

of wine. A beat] B.Y.

MICHAEL

It's busy?

EMORY

[Nods]



Loraine is probably talking to her mother. Oh, yes, Delbert married Loraine.

MICHAEL

I'm sorry, you'll have to forfeit your turn. We can t wait. [Takes the phone, hands it to larry, who starts to dial]

HAROLD

[To larry] Well, you're not wasting any time.

HANK

Who are you calling?

LARRY

Charlie.

[ emory gets up, jerks the phone out of larry'* hands]

EMORY

I refuse to forfeit my turn! It's my turn and I'm taking it!

MICHAEL

That's the spirit, Emory! Hit that iceberg — dorit miss it! Hit it! Goddamnit! I want a smash of a finale!

EMORY

Oh, God, I'm drunk.

MICHAEL

Afalling-down-drunk-nellie-queen.

HAROLD

Well, that's the pot calling the kettle beige!


MICHAEL

[Snapping. To harold] I am not drunkl You cannot tell that I am drunk! Donald! I'm not drunk! Am I!

DONALD

Vm drunk.

EMORY

So am 1.1 am a major drunk.

MICHAEL

[To emory] Shut up and dial!

EMORY

[Dialing] I am a major drunk of this or any other season.

DONALD

[To michael] Don't you mean shut up and deal.

EMORY

... It's ringing. It is no longer B.Y. Hello?

MICHAEL

[Taking note] One point.

EMORY

.. . Who's speaking? Who? . .. Doctor Delbert Botts?

MICHAEL

Two points.



EMORY

Oh, Del, is this really you? Oh, nobody. You don't know me. You wouldn't remember me. I'm . . . just a friend. A falling-down drunken friend. Hello? Hello? Hello?

[Lowers the receiver] He hung up.

[ emory hangs up the telephone]

MICHAEL

Three points total. You're winning.

EMORY

He said I must have the wrong party.

[bernard gets up, goes into the kitchen]

HAROLD

He's right. We have the wrong party. We should be somewhere else.

EMORY

It's your party, Hallie. Aren't you having a good time?

HAROLD

Simply fabulous. And what about you? Are you having a good time, Emory? Are you having as good a time as you thought you would?

[ larry takes the phone]

MICHAEL

If you're bored, Harold, we could sing Happy Birthday again —to the tune of Havah Nageelah.

[ harold takes out another cigarette]

HAROLD

Not for all the tea in Mexico. [Lights up]


HANK

My turn now.

LARRY

It's my turn to call Charlie.

HANK

No. Let me.

LARRY

Are you going to call Charlie?

MICHAEL

The score is three to two. Emory's favor.

ALAN

Don't, Hank. Don't you see—Bernard was right.

HANK

[Firmly, to alan] I want to.

[A beat. Holds out his hand for the phone] Larry?

[A beat]

LARRY

[Gives him the phone] Be my eager guest.

COWBOY

[To larry] Is he going to call Charlie for you?

[larry breaks into laughter, hank starts to dial]

LARRY

Charlie is all the people I cheat on Hank with.



DONALD

With whom I cheat on Hank.

MICHAEL

The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker.

LARRY

Right! I love 'em all. And what he refuses to understand— is that I've got to have 'em all. I am not the marrying kind, and I never will be.

HAROLD

Gypsy feet.

LARRY

Who are you calling?

MICHAEL

Jealous?

LARRY

Curious as hell!

MICHAEL

And a little jealous too.

LARRY

Who are you calling?

MICHAEL

Did it ever occur to you that Hank might be doing the same thing behind your back that you do behind his?

LARRY

I wish to Christ he would. It'd make life a hell of a lot easier. Who are you calling?



• Act 2

HAROLD

Whoever it is, they're not sitting on top of the telephone.

HANK

Hello?

COWBOY

They must have been in the tub.

MICHAEL

[Snaps at cowboy]

Eighty-six!

[cowboy goes over to a far corner, sits down. Bernard enters, uncorking another bottle of wine. Taking note]

One point.

HANK

... I'd like to leave a message.

MICHAEL

Not in. One point.

HANK

Would you say that Hank called. Yes, it is. Oh, good evening, how are you?

LARRY

Who the hell is that?

HANK

. . . Yes, that's right—the message is for my roommate, Larry. Just say that I called and ...

150





LARRY

It's our answering service!

HANK

... and said ... I love you.

MICHAEL

Five points! You said it! You get five goddamn points for saying it!

ALAN

Hank! Hank!... Are you crazy?

HANK

. . . No. You didn't hear me incorrectiy. That's what I said. The message is for Larry and it's from me, Hank, and it is just as I said: I . . . love . . . you. Thanks. [Hangs up]

MICHAEL

Seven points total! Hank, you're ahead, baby. You're way, way ahead of everybody!

ALAN

Why? ... Oh, Hank, why? Why did you do that?

HANK

Because I do love him. And I don't care who knows it.

ALAN

Don't say that.

HANK

Why not? It's the truth.


ALAN

I can't believe you.

HANK

[Directly to alan] I left my wife and family for Larry.

ALAN

I'm really not interested in hearing about it.

MICHAEL

Sure you are. Go ahead, Hankola, tell him all about it.

ALAN

No! I don't want to hear it. It's disgusting! [A heat]

HANK

Some men do it for another woman.

ALAN

Well, I could understand that. That's normal.

HANK

It just doesn't always work out that way, Alan. No matter how you might want it to. And God knows, nobody ever wanted it more than I did. I really and truly felt that I was in love with my wife when I married her. It wasn't altogether my trying to prove something to myself. I did love her and she loved me. But . . . there was always that something there...

DONALD

You mean your attraction to your own sex.

HANK

Yes.

ALAN

Always?

HANK

I don't know. I suppose so.

EMORY

I've known what I was since I was four years old.

MICHAEL

Everybody's always known it about you, Emory.

DONALD

I've always known it about myself too.

HANK

I don't know when it was that I started admitting it to myself. For so long I either labeled it something else or denied it completely.

MICHAEL

Christ- was-I-drunk-last-night.

HANK

And then there came a time when I just couldn't lie to myself any more ... I tiiought about it but I never did anything about it. I think the first time was during my wife's last pregnancy. We lived near New Haven—in the country. She and the kids still live there. Well, anyway, there was a teachers' meeting here in New York. She didn't feel up to the trip and I came alone. And that day on the train I began to

think about it and think about it and think about it. I thought of nothing else the whole trip. And within fifteen minutes after I had arrived I had picked up a guy in the men's room of Grand Central Station.

ALAN

[Quietly] Jesus.

HANK

I'd never done anything like that in my life before and I was scared to death. But he turned out to be a nice fellow. I've never seen him again and it's funny I can't even remember his name any more.

[A beat] Anyway. After that, it got easier.

HAROLD

Practice makes perfect.

HANK

And then . . . sometime later . . . not veiy long after, Larry was in New Haven and we met at a party my wife and I had gone in town for.

EMORY

And your real troubles began.

HANK

That was two years ago.

LARRY

Why am I always the goddamn villain in the piece! If I'm not thought of as a happy-home wrecker, I'm an impossible son of a bitch to live with!


HAROLD

Guilt turns to hostility. Isn't that right, Michael?

MICHAEL

Go stick your tweezers in your cheek.

LARRY

I'm fed up to the teeth with everybody feeling so goddamn sorry for poor shat-upon Hank.

EMORY

Aw, Larry, everybody knows you re Frieda Fickle.

LARRY

I've never made any promises and I never intend to. It's my right to lead my sex life without answering to anybody — Hank included! And if those terms are not acceptable, then we must not live together. Numerous relations is a part of the way I am!

EMORY

You don't have to be gay to be a wanton.

LARRY

By the way I am, I don't mean being gay—I mean my sexual appetite. And I don't think of myself as a wanton. Emory, you are the most promiscuous person I know.

EMORY

I am not promiscuous at all!

MICHAEL

Not by choice. By design. Why would anybody want to go to bed with a flaming little sissy like you?

BERNARD

Michael!

MICHAEL

[To emory] Who'd make a pass at you—I'll tell you who—nobody. Except maybe some fugitive from the Braille Institute.

BERNARD

[To emory] Why do you let him talk to you that way?

HAROLD

Physical beauty is not everything.

MICHAEL

Thank you, Quasimodo.

LARRY

What do you think it's like living with the goddamn gestapo! I can't breathe without getting the third degree!

MICHAEL

Larry, it's your turn to call.

LARRY

I can't take all that let's-be-faithful-and-never-look-at-an-other-person routine. It just doesn't work. If you want to promise that, fine. Then do it and stick to it. But if you have to promise it—as far as I'm concerned—nothing finishes a relationship faster.

HAROLD

Give me Librium or give me Meth.



BERNARD

[Intoxicated now] Yeah, freedom, baby! Freedom!

LARRY

You gotta have it! It can't work any other way. And the ones who swear their undying fidelity are lying. Most of them, anyway—ninety percent of them. They cheat on each other constantly and lie through their teeth. I'm sorry, I can't be like that and it drives Hank up the wall.

HANK

There is that ten percent.

LARRY

The only way it stands a chance is with some sort of an understanding.

HANK

IVe tried to go along with that.

LARRY

Aw, come on!

HANK

I agreed to an agreement.

LARRY

Your agreement.

MICHAEL

What agreement?

LARRY

A menage.


HAROLD

The lover's agreement.

LARRY

Look, I know a lot of people think it's the answer. They don't consider it cheating. But it's not my style.

HANK

Well, I certainly didn't want it.

LARRY

Then who suggested it?

HANK

It was a compromise.

LARRY

Exactly.

HANK

And you agreed.

LARRY

I didn't agree to anything. You agreed to your own proposal and informed me that I agreed.

COWBOY

I don't understand. What's a me . . . menaa . . .

MICHAEL

A menage a trois, baby. Two's company—three's a menage.

COWBOY

Oh.


HANK

It works for some.

LARRY

Well, I'm not one for group therapy. I'm sorry, I can't relate to anyone or anything that way. I'm old-fashioned—I like 'em all, but I like 'em one at a time!

MICHAEL

[To LARRY]

Did you like Donald as a single side attraction? [Pause]

LARRY

Yes. I did.

DONALD

So did I, Larry.

LARRY

[To donald, referring to michael] Did you tell him?

DONALD

No.

MICHAEL

It was perfectly obvious from the moment you walked in. What was that song and dance about having seen each other but never having met?

DONALD

It was true. We saw each other in the baths and went to bed together but we never spoke a word and never knew each other's name.


EMORY

You had better luck than I do. If I don't get arrested, my trick announces upon departure that he's been exposed to hepatitis!

MICHAEL

In spring a young man's fancy turns to a fancy young man.

LARRY

[To hank] Don't look at me like that. You've been playing footsie with the Blue Book all night.

DONALD

I think he only wanted to show you what's good for the gander is good for the gander.

HANK

That's right.

LARRY

[To hank] I suppose you'd like the three of us to have a go at it.

hank

At least it'd be together.

LARRY

That point eludes me.

hank What kind of an understanding do you want!

LARRY

Respect—for each other's freedom. With no need to lie or pretend. In my own way, Hank, I love you, but you have to understand that even though I do want to go on living with you, sometimes there may be others. I don't want to flaunt it in your face. If it happens, I know I'll never mention it. But if you ask me, I'll tell you. I don't want to hurt you but I won't lie to you if you want to know anything about me.

BERNARD

He gets points.

MICHAEL

What?

BERNARD

He said it. He said "I love you" to Hank. He gets the bonus.

MICHAEL

He didn't call him.

DONALD

He called him. He just didn't use the telephone.

MICHAEL

Then he doesn't get any points.

BERNARD

He gets five points!

MICHAEL

He didn't use the telephone. He doesn't get a goddamn thing! [larry goes to the phone, picks up the receiver, looks at the number of the second line, dials. A beat. The phone rings]

LARRY

It's for you, Hank. Why don't you take it upstairs?

[The phone continues to ring, hank gets up, goes up the stairs to the bedroom. Pause. He presses the second-line button, picks up the receiver. Everyone downstairs is silent]

HANK

Hello?

BERNARD

One point.

LARRY

Hello, Hank.

BERNARD

Two points.

LARRY

... This is Larry.

BERNARD

Two more points!

LARRY

. .. For what it's worth, I love you.

BERNARD

Five points bonus!

HANK

I'll. .. I'll try.



LARRY

I will too.

[Hangs up. hank hangs up]

BERNARD

That's ten points total!

EMORY

Larry's the winner!

HAROLD

Well, that wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be.

MICHAEL

THE GAME ISN'T OVER YET!

[hank moves toward the bed into darkness] Your turn, Alan.

[michael gets the phone, slams it down in front of alan] PICK UP THE PHONE, BUSTER!

EMORY

Michael, don't!

MICHAEL

STAY OUT OF THIS!

EMORY

You don't have to, Alan. You don't have to.

ALAN

Emory ... I'm sorry for what I did before.

[A beat]

EMORY

... Oh, forget it.

MICHAEL

Forgive us our trespasses. Christ, now you're both joined at the goddamn hip! You can decorate his home, Emory— —and he can get you out of jail the next time you're arrested on a morals charge.

[A beat] Who are you going to call, Alan?

[No response] Can't remember anyone? Well, maybe you need a minute to think. Is that it?

[No response]

HAROLD

I believe this will be the final round.

COWBOY

Michael, aren't you going to call anyone?

HAROLD

How could he? He's never loved anyone.

MICHAEL

[Sings the classic vaudeville walk-off to harold] "No matter how you figger, It's tough to be a nigger,

[Indicates Bernard] But it's tougher To be a Jeeeew-ooouu-oo!"

DONALD

My God, Michael, you're a charming host.

HAROLD

Michael doesn't have charm, Donald. Michael has counter-charm.

[larry crosses to the stairs]



MICHAEL

Going somewhere?

[ larry stops, turns to michael]

LARRY

Yes. Excuse me.

[Turns, goes up the stairs]

MICHAEL

You're going to miss the end of the game.

LARRY

[Pauses on stairs] You can tell me how it comes out.

MICHAEL

I never reveal an ending. And no one will be reseated during the climactic revelation.

LARRY

With any luck, I wont be back until it's all over. [Turns, continues up the stairs into the dark]

MICHAEL

[Into alan's ear] What do you suppose is going on up there? Hmmm, Alan? What do you imagine Lany and Hank are doing? Hmmmmm? Shooting marbles?

EMORY

Whatever they're doing, they're not hurting anyone.

HAROLD

And they're minding their own business.



MICHAEL

And you mind yours, Harold. I'm warning you! [A beat]

HAROLD

[Coolly] Are you now? Are you warning me? Me? I'm Harold. I'm the one person you don't warn, Michael. Because you and I are a match. And we tread very softly with each other because we both play each other's game too well. Oh, I know this game you're playing. I know it very well. And I play it very well. You play it very well too. But you know what, I'm the only one that's better at it than you are. I can beat you at it. So don't push me. I'm warning you.

[A beat, michael starts to laugh]

MICHAEL

You're funny, Hallie. A laff riot. Isn't he funny, Alan? Or, as you might say, isn't he amusing. He's an amusing faggot, isn't he? Or, as you might say, freak. That's what you called Emory, wasn't it? A freak? A pansy? My, what an antiquated vocabulary you have. I'm surprised you didn't say sodomite or pederast.

[A beat] You'd better let me bring you up to date. Now it's not so new, but it might be new to you—

[A beat] Have you heard the term "closet queen"? Do you know what that means? Do you know what it means to be "in the closet"?

EMORY

Don't, Michael. It won't help anything to explain what it means.

166





MICHAEL

He already knows. He knows very, very well what a closet queen is. Don't you, Alan? [Pause]

ALAN

Michael, if you are insinuating that I am homosexual, I can only say that you are mistaken.

MICHAEL

Ami?

[A beat] What about Justin Stuart?

ALAN

... What about.. . Justin Stuart?

MICHAEL

You were in love with him, that's what about him.

[A beat] And that is who you are going to call.

ALAN

Justin and I were very good friends. That is all. Unfortunately, we had a parting of the ways and that was the end of the friendship. We have not spoken for years. I most certainly will not call him now.

MICHAEL

According to Justin, the friendship was quite passionate.

ALAN

What do you mean?

MICHAEL

I mean that you slept with him in college. Several times.



ALAN

That is not true!

MICHAEL

Several times. One time, it's youth. Twice, a phase maybe. Several times, you like it!

ALAN

IT'S NOT TRUE!

MICHAEL

Yes, it is. Because Justin Stuart is homosexual. He comes to New York on occasion. He calls me. I've taken him to parties. Larry "had" him once. J have slept with Justin Stuart. And he has told me all about you.

ALAN

Then he told you a lie. [A beat ]

MICHAEL

You were obsessed with Justin. That's all you talked about, morning, noon, and night. You started doing it about Hank upstairs tonight. What an attractive fellow he is and all that transparent crap.

ALAN

He is an attractive fellow. What's wrong with saying so?

MICHAEL

Would you like to join him and Larry right now?

ALAN

I said he was attractive. That's all.



MICHAEL

How many times do you have to say it? How many times did you have to say it about Justin: what a good tennis player he was; what a good dancer he was; what a good body he had; what good taste he had; how bright he was—how amusing he was—how the girls were all mad for him— what close friends you were.

ALAN

We . . . we . . . were . . . very close . . . very good . . .-friends. That's all!

MICHAEL

It was obvious —and when you did it around Fran it was downright embarrassing. Even she must have had her doubts about you.

ALAN

Justin . . . lied. If he told you that, he lied. It is a lie. A vicious lie. He'd say anything about me now to get even. He could never get over the fact that I dropped him. But I had to. I had to because ... he told me ... he told me about himself ... he told me that he wanted to be my lover. And I . . . I . . . told him ... he made me sick ... I told him I pitied him. [A heat ]

MICHAEL

You ended the friendship, Alan, because you couldn't face the truth about yourself. You could go along, sleeping with Justin, as long as he lied to himself and you lied to yourself and you both dated girls and labeled yourselves men and called yourselves just fond friends. But Justin finally had to be honest about the truth, and you couldn't take it. You couldn't take it and so you destroyed the friendship and your friend along with it.

[michael goes to the desk and gets address book]

ALAN

No!

MICHAEL

Justin could never understand what he'd done wrong to make you cut him off. He blamed himself.

ALAN

No!

MICHAEL

He did until he eventually found out who he was and what

he was.

ALAN

No!

MICHAEL

But to this day he still remembers the treatment—the scars he got from you.

[Puts address book in front of alan on coffee table]

ALAN

NO!

MICHAEL

Pick up this phone and call Justin. Call him and apologize and tell him what you should have told him twelve years ago. [Picks up the phone, shoves it at alan]



ALAN

NO! HE LIED! NOT A WORD IS TRUE!

MICHAEL

CALL HIM!

[alan wont take the phone] All right then, I'll dial!

HAROLD

You're so helpful.

[michael starts to dial]

ALAN

Give it to me.

[michael hands alan tlw receiver, alan takes it, hangs up for a moment, lifts it again, staUs to dial. Everyone watches silently, alan finishes dialing, lifts the receiver to his ear] . . . Hello?

MICHAEL

One point.

ALAN

... It's .. . it's Alan.

MICHAEL

Two points.

ALAN

... Yes, yes, it's me.

MICHAEL

Is it Justin?

ALAN

... You sound surprised.


MICHAEL

I should hope to think so—after twelve years! Two more points.

ALAN

I ... I'm in New York. Yes. I ... I won't explain now . . . I ... I just called to tell you . . .

MICHAEL

THAT I LOVE YOU, GODDAMNIT! I LOVE YOU!

ALAN

I love you.

MICHAEL

You get the goddamn bonus, TEN POINTS TOTAL! JACKPOT!

ALAN

I love you and I beg you to forgive me.

MICHAEL

Give me that!

[Snatches the phone from alan] Justin! Did you hear what that son of a bitch said!

[A heat, michael is speechless for a moment] .. . Fran?

[A beat] Well, of course I expected it to be you!...

[A heat] How are you? Me, too. Yes, yes ... he told me everything. Oh, don't thank me. Please . .. Please ...

[A beat] I'll ,,. Ill put him back on.



[A beat] My love to the kids ...

ALAN

. . . Darling? I'll take the first plane I can get. Yes. I'm sorry too. I love you very much.

[Hangs up, stands, crosses to the door, stops. Tunis around, surveys the group] Thank you, Michael.

[Opens the door and exits.

Silence, michael slowly sinks down on the couch, covering

his face.

Pause]

COWBOY

Who won?

DONALD

It was a tie.

[harold crosses to michael]

HAROLD

[Calmly, coldly, clinically] Now it is my turn. And ready or not, Michael, here goes.

[A beat] You are a sad and pathetic man. You're a homosexual and you don't want to be. But there is nothing you can do to change it. Not all your prayers to your God, not all the analysis you can buy in all the years you've got left to live. You may very well one day be able to know a heterosexual life if you want it desperately enough—if you pursue it with the fervor with which you annihilate—but you will always be homosexual as well. Always, Michael. Always. Until the day you die.

[Turns, gathers his gifts, goes to emory. emory stands up unsteadily]

Oh, friends, thanks for the nifty party and the super gift. [Looks toward cowboy]

It's just what I needed.

[emory smiles*, harold gives him a hug, spots Bernard sitting on the floor, head bowed]

... Bernard, thank you.

[No response. To emory]

Will you get him home?

EMORY

Don't worry about her. Ill take care of everything.

[harold turns to donald, who is at the bar making himself another drink]

HAROLD

Donald, good to see you.

DONALD

Good night, Harold. See you again sometime.

HAROLD

Yeah. How about a year from Shavuoth?

[harold goes to cowboy] Come on, Tex. Let's go to my place.

[cowboy gets up, comes to him]

Are you good in bed?

COWBOY

Well . . . I'm not like the average hustler you'd meet. I try to show a little affection—it keeps me from feeling like such a whore.

[A beat, harold turns, cowboy opens the door for them.

They start out. harold pauses]



HAROLD

Oh, Michael. .. thanks for the laughs. Call you tomorrow. [No response. A beat, harold and cowboy exit]

EMORY

Come on, Bernard. Time to go home.

[ emory, frail as he is, manages to pull Bernard's arm

around his neck, gets him on his feet] Oh, Mary, you're a heavy mother.

BERNARD

[Practically inaudible mumble] Why did I call? Why?

EMORY

Thank you, Michael. Good night, Donald.

DONALD

Goodbye, Emory.

BERNARD

Why...

EMORY

It's all right, Bernard. Everything's all right. I'm going to make you some coffee and everything's going to be all right.

[emory virtually carries Bernard out. donald closes the

door. Silence.

michael slowly slips from the couch onto the floor. A beat.

Then slowly he begins a low moan that increases in volume

— almost like a siren. Suddenly he slams his open hands to

his ears]

MICHAEL

[In desperate panic] Donald! Donald! DONALD! DONALD!

I donald puts down his drink, rushes to michael. michael

is now white with fear and tears are bursting from his eyes.

He begins to gasp his words] Oh, no! No! What have I done! Oh, my God, what have I done!

[michael writhing, donald holds him, cradles him in his

arms]

DONALD

Michael! Michael!

MICHAEL [Weeping] Oh, no! NO! It's beginning! The liquor is starting to wear off and the anxiety is beginning! Oh, NO! No! I feel it! I know it's going to happen. Donald!! Donald! Don't leave me! Please! Please! Oh, my God, what have I done! Oh Jesus, the guilt! I can't handle it any more. I won't make it!

DONALD

[Physically subduing him] Michael! Michael! Stop it! Stop it! I'll give you a Valium— I've got some in my pocket!

MICHAEL

[Hysterical] No! No! Pills and alcohol—I'll die!

DONALD

I'm not going to give you the whole bottle! Come on, let go of me!

MICHAEL

[Clutching him] NO!



DONALD

Let go of me long enough for me to get my hand in my pocket!

MICHAEL

Don't leave!

[michael quiets down a bit, lets go of donald enough for him to take a small plastic bottle from his pocket and open it to give michael a tranquilizer]

DONALD

Here.

MICHAEL

[Sobbing] I don't have any water to swallow it with!

DONALD

Well, if you'll wait one goddamn minute, I'll get you some!

[michael lets go of him. He goes to the bar, gets a glass of

water and returns] Your water, your Majesty.

[A beat] Michael, stop that goddamn crying and take this pill!

michael straightens up, puts the pill into his mouth amid

choking sobs, takes the water, drinks, returns the glass to

donald]

MICHAEL

I'm like Ole Man River—tired of livin' and scared o' dyin\ [donald puts the glass on the bar, comes back to the couch, sits down, michael collapses into his arms, sobbing. Pause]

DONALD

Shhhhh. Shhhhhh. Michael. Shhhhhh. Michael. Michael. [donald rocks him back and forth. He quiets. Pause]

MICHAEL

... If we ... if we could just . . . not hate ourselves so much. That's it, you know. If we could just learn not to hate ourselves quite so very much.

DONALD

Yes, I know. I know.

[A beat] Inconceivable as it may be, you used to be worse than you are now.

[A beat] Maybe with a lot more work you can help yourself some more—if you try.

[michael straightens up, dries his eyes on his sleeve]

MICHAEL

Who was it that used to always say, "You show me a happy homosexual, and I'll show you a gay corpse."

DONALD

I don't know. Who was it who always used to say that?

MICHAEL

And how dare you come on with that holier-than-thou attitude with me! "A lot more work," "if I try," indeed! You've got a long row to hoe before you're perfect, you know.

DONALD

I never said I didn't.

MICHAEL

And while we're on the subject—I think your analyst is a quack.

[michael is sniffling, donald hands him a handkerchief. He

takes it and blows his nose]



DONALD

Earlier you said he was a prick.

MICHAEL

That's right. He's a prick quack. Or a quack prick, whichever you prefer.

[donald gets up from the couch, goes for his drink]

DONALD

[Heaving a sigh] Harold was right. You'll never change.

MICHAEL

Come back, Donald. Come back, Shane.

DONALD

I'll come back when you have another anxiety attack.

MICHAEL

I need you. Just like Mickey Mouse needs Minnie Mouse —just like Donald Duck needs Minnie Duck. Mickey needs Donnie.

DONALD

My name is Donald. I am called Donald. You must never call anyone called Donald Donnie ...

MICHAEL

[Grabs his head, moans] Ohhhhh . . . icks! Icks! Terrible icks! Tomorrow is going to be an ick-packed day. It's going to be a Bad Day at Black Rock. A day of nerves, nerves, and more nerves!

[michael gets up from the couch, surveys the wreckage of

the dishes and gift torappings]

Do you suppose there's any possibility of just burning this room?

[A beat]

DONALD

Why do you think he stayed, Michael? Why do you think he took all of that from you?

MICHAEL

There are no accidents. He was begging to get killed. He was dying for somebody to let him have it and he got what he wanted.

DONALD

He could have been telling the truth—Justin could have lied.

MICHAEL

Who knows? What time is it?

DONALD

It seems like it's day after tomorrow.

[michael goes to the kitchen door, pokes his head in. Comes back into the room carrying a raincoat]

MICHAEL

It's early.

[Goes to a closet door, takes out a blazer, puts it on]

DONALD

What does life hold? Where're you going?

MICHAEL

The bedroom is ocupado and I don't want to go to sleep anyway until I try to walk off the booze. If I went to sleep like this, when I wake up they'd have to put me in a padded cell—not that that's where I don't belong.



[A beat] And . . . and . . . there's a midnight mass at St. Malachy's that all the show people go to. I think I'll walk over there and catch it.

DONALD

[Raises his glass] Well, pray for me.

MICHAEL

[Indicates bedroom] Maybe they'll be gone by the time I get back.

DONALD

Well, I will be—just as soon as I knock off that bottle of brandy.

MICHAEL

Will I see you next Saturday?

DONALD

Unless you have other plans.

MICHAEL

No.

[Turns to go]

DONALD

Michael?

MICHAEL

[Stops, turns back] What?



DONALD

Did he ever tell you why he was crying on the phone—what it was he had to tell you?

MICHAEL

No. It must have been that he'd left Fran. Or maybe it was something else and he changed his mind.

DONALD

Maybe so.

[A beat] I wonder why he left her.

[A pause]

MICHAEL

... As my father said to me when he died in my arms, "I don't understand any of it. I never did."

[A beat, donald goes to his stack of books, selects one, and

sits in a chair]

Turn out the lights when you leave, will you?

[donald nods, michael looks at him for a long silent moment, donald turns his attention to his book, starts to read. michael opens the door and exits]
