LOUISA
(crossing onto the stage from the audience to center stage)
HILARIOUS
“Hit it, Maestro!”
LOUISA
It’s no use! I’m stuck. Can’t write a word.
HILARIOUS
Jo! You’re scratching out everything you’ve written today.
LOUISA
Can’t help it. It’s not worth reading. If Father were here, he’d tell me to throw it on the fire.
HILARIOUS
Put it away for a while, Jo dear, and give your mind a rest. You’ve been working over it all day.
LOUISA
I know it. And nothing to show for it. Oh dear! Sometimes I’m afraid I’ll never learn to be a writer.
HILARIOUS
Oh, yes you will! One of these days, you’ll write a great book. And people will read it all over the world. And you’ll be very famous. And very rich!
KHURVE
Pre-sum-tu-ously rich!
LOUISA
( laughing) Well, I wish it would happen right this minute, then - so we could all give presents for Christmas.
KHURVE
So do I! Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents.
HILARIOUS
Well, Mother thinks we ought not to spend our money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army.
LOUISA
Christopher Columbus, Meg! The little money we have wouldn’t do the army any good. Let’s each buy what we want, and have a little fun! I’m sure we’ve worked hard enough to earn it.
HILARIOUS
I know I do, teaching those tiresome children all day, when I’m longing to enjoy myself at home.
LOUISA
You don’t have half such a time as I do, with Aunt March. How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady?
KHURVE
I don’t believe any of you suffer as I do, for you don’t have to go to school with impertinent girls who laugh at your dresses and - label your father if he isn’t rich.
LOUISA
( laughing) If you mean libel, Amy, I’d say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa were a pickle bottle.
KHURVE
(with dignity) I know what I mean, and you needn’t be so statistical about it, Jo March. It’s proper to use good words, and improve your vocabillary. Don’t whistle, Jo. It’s so boyish.
LOUISA
That’s why I do it.
KHURVE
I detest rude, unlady-like girls.
LOUISA
And I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!

SURVEY THE AUDIENCE WE HEAR EXPRESSIONS LIKE
“OH WOW!” And “LOOK AT THAT ONE! SHIT!” and “SOME KNOCKERS! EOOK AT THE TITS ON THAT ONE” etc. This builds in excitement until the binoculars draw back from the gaps and the umbrella tent is tossed backwards over the shoulders of the performers revealing three completely naked bodies. Blackout.
KHURVE
Hey wait a minute! Let’s take that back, I want to see that again.
KHURVE
Hm . . . Just what I thought. MM hm.
LOUISA
The show dealt with a subject usually discussed only in medical journals.
HILARIOUS
The police should forbid on the stage what they forbid on the street.
KHURVE
Looks like burlesque is going the way of all flesh.

LOUISA
I’ve been struck!
HILARIOUS AND KHURVE
( realizing they are not alone) Struck?
LOUISA
Excuse me . . . hee . . . heee Laughter - silence.
ALL
I saw a horse!

A horse with wings.
LOUISA
Yes, I noticed!
KHURVE
It was . . .
LOUISA
Brown . . .
HILARIOUS

LOUISA
Roan . . . like the pony he kept in that yard where the morning glories grew on the sides . . .
KHURVE
Someone was sitting . . .

Hair like a cloud . . .
KHURVE

LOUISA
Like a puff of smoke!
HILARIOUS
Her arms were feathered!
KHURVE
Wings!

They must have been wings!
KHURVE
I don’t think so at all.

A sweater . . .
LOUISA
A flying sweater!
HILARIOUS
I’m sweating!
KHURVE
I’m flying!
LOUISA
I’m thinking.
HILARIOUS
(to Louisa) Can I help you?
KHURVE
With what?
LOUISA
Thank you!
HILARIOUS
Can you stand?
KHURVE
What?
LOUISA
Stand. Can you stand?
KHURVE
Stand what?
LOUISA
I’m thinking ... I think I’ve been struck!
KHURVE
You look very nice.
LOUISA
Thank you.
HILARIOUS
You both look very nice.
LOUISA AND KHURVE
Thank you.
LOUISA
(to Hilarious) You also look ... very ... you look like ... you look very . . . very much like me, actually . . .
KHURVE
Oh hon, I really don’t see that . . .
LOUISA
Not like me ... no not really at all ... you both look . . . really . . . like . . . thoughts! You both look like thoughts!
HILARIOUS
Thank you.
KHURVE
Wait. Wait. Just wait a second. Dearie? We look like thoughts?
LOUISA
Yes. You look like thoughts. You look . . .well . . . you look like the process ... of thinking . . .
KHURVE
What are you talking about?
HILARIOUS
Where is this going?
LOUISA
Why are you both so . . .
ALL
WHERE ARE WE?
LOUISA
I guess it really doesn’t matter very much.
KHURVE
What do you mean it doesn’t matter very much? How can we order in if we don’t know where we are?
HILARIOUS
We’re in Hell!
KHURVE
We’re in Heaven!
ALL
We’re in sbock\ (They stand up, finally)
LOUISA
What’s important here ... of the essence, in fact ... is that we’re together.
KHURVE
Do you think that means something?
HILARIOUS
Chinese food.
KHURVE
That sounds fine.
HILARIOUS
Not even Chinese food can help us at a moment like this . ..

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

The Marchs’ sitting room, several weeks later. The Christmas decorations have been removed. Meg is at the writing desk, Amy at the fireplace, with her drawing-board; and Beth at the window, looking out anxiously. It is early afternoon.
HILARIOUS
Praise the Lord!
THEY SPRING APART
Pardon?
HILARIOUS
Praise the Lord! The kingdom of I leaven belongs to the righteous!
KHURVE
No it doesn’t!
LOUISA
She speaks metaphorically! HILARIOUS
LOUISA
Yes you are!
HILARIOUS
( pointing to Heaven) What’s that, then?
KHURVE
How do you know what other people think?
LOUISA
I’m the writer!
KHURVE
Who gives a shit?
HILARIOUS
Look who they let in here!
KHURVE
Fuckin’ A! (She laughs happily)
HILARIOUS
I have preached the word of God and now I am the lamb of God!
KHURVE
I starred! I absolutely starred! I make love movies. All those love movies, I’m the star.
HILARIOUS
The black crook dancer . . .
LOUISA
Just like I pictured them! They’re perfect! Perfect! (To the audience) Can you see the conflict? Only it’s not really a conflict. We hang the hammock of our lives between the trees of our inner opposites! If only society weren’t so organized against the truth.
HILARIOUS
If only the Devil were laid to rest!
KHURVE
If only my hairdresser were here!
AS CARNIVAL MUSIC COMES UP THE THREE CHARACTERS GO FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE SUITCASES
HOW TO CHANGE SCENERY ” accompanied by the appropriate illustration. She hangs the cloud on a hook above her head. (This placing of clouds with chapter headings and illustrations will continue throughout the performance until the clouds occupy roughly the equivalent positions found on a stage employing Italian Renaissance scenery.)
LOUISA
(standing at center stage, addressing the audience) I am what remains of Louisa May Alcott. My life, my life is a play for two characters, and since I chose to remain unmarried, I play both parts. My life is a play for two characters, written by two hands, a portrait, in fact, of two hands drawing each other. Did you know that in my later life I taught myself to write with my left hand, so that I could stay at my desk twice as long and produce twice as much? And I found to my delight and amazement that my left hand wrote in a voice more intimate, more seductive, more passionate . .. more culturally marginal than my right hand. My right hand . . . oh, you know my right hand. This is the hand that supports my family, the hand that Jo sprang from, and all the little women, my right hand. And what if they might meet someday, in an earthy paradise, a garden, perhaps. (During this section of the monologue
SHE USES THE APPROPRIATE HAND TO INDICATE EACH VOICE
I know you, you have whispered through my chambers. You have disguised yourself in the smell of my geraniums, you have cloaked yourself in my morning glories, you lured me into this garden. And she ( left hand) would say
I THROW MYSELF AT YOUR FEET
I beg your pardon? . . . And she would say
THE END OF THIS SCENE IS AN ATTEMPTED SEDUCTION OF THE RIGHT HAND BY THE LEFT WHILE THE CONFLICT IS REPRESENTED PHYSICALLY BY HILARIOUS ON THE RIGHT AND KHURVE ON THE LEFT
HOW TO CHANGE SCENERY BY ANOTHER METHOD.” She continues to play the kazoo until she hangs her cloud stage left and sets her music center stage for her sermon. Louisa curtsies and exits. Khurve moves upstage left and sits on a stool and watches as Hilarious delivers her monologue.
HILARIOUS
(at the center, loudly) Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! (A bell rings) Don’t miss it! You’re missing nine-tenths of what you were born for! (She crosses the stage into the audience and passes out slips of paper with little sayings printed on them, such as “Clothes Make the Man,” and speaks in a gentler voice while in the audience) Hello, sweetheart, don’t be afraid. Aren’t you a little darling! It’s nice to see you tonight! (She crosses back to center stage, speaking loudly) Step right up, step right up! Let us be in Heaven together! How do you like this? Hilarious B. Hooves, that’s my name! Hilarious, my given name, named after my first mother. Of course, we all have only one mother, the mother of God! (She pulls a small statue of the Virgin Mary from her pocket and displays it) We kill, we kill. We kill one by one over the rooftops. We kill for love! (She crosses again into the audience, passing out slips of paper, ad-libbing to audience, then returns to center stage) Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! I am talking about the truth! Like my mother (she shows the statue again), and the mother of us all, I have an open throat. Please stand back, I spit when I talk! This morning, with my voice lowered by morning, I started my daily rituals, and in my thoughts formed words that giggled inside me. Stand back please, I spit when I talk! Oh, that I could share with you, so early in the day, in trying to adjust my shoulders and put the swing back in my hips that will enable our communion, and I ask the Lord, dear God, to give me the ability to rock back and forth. I ask the Lord, dear God, to enable me to win your love that you will be attracted to my truth. And I ask the Lord, dear God, to help me lead you to that gray area. That area we don’t work very hard to understand. That area somewhere between the night and the dawn, somewhere between our hearts and our thighs. Just look at this! Chinese food cannot help us at a moment like this, oh my hearers! When we seek that holy and sacred place we
ALL WANT TO UNDERSTAND
if you should happen to go around the corner to Hell mixed .up in the rip and roar, men in little holes are ready to sell you tickets of wrath to go in and see the black crook dance and the hips that jiggle with nothing to wear. Obliging drivers are willing and offering to take you where the brass bands play and to where fortunes amount to nothing under the flesh. Hear their screams! ( She crosses down into the audience, throwing the slips of paper into the air) Take it! Take it! Take my happiness and spread it like the seed of the twelve tribes of Israel! Do not defend the fact anymore. If I wanted to be liked I wouldn’t hang around this place! Jesus had only three friends and one of them killed him. You mistake the fact for an actor! You mistake the Lord for an actor upon the stage! You go home to your salacious couches! You don’t see the future! You don’t see the whole thing! Let us pray! Every head bowed, every eye closed. ( She kneels on one knee and sings in an earnest voice) Jesus wants me for a sunbeam, sunbeam, sunbeam. Jesus wants you for a sunbeam to shine for him each day. (During this Khurve has crossed to stage left, where she gets a suitcase, then she crosses to right center. She takes from the suitcase a very large fake rock and begins slowly and laboriously to cross toward Hilarious) Guide us in that area where we wander, or are tempted to wander, our own body. Guide as at a price that is lower than our cost, as we are especially anxious at our conditions. Temptations try us over. Our flesh is weak. But thou art with us in that area, that gray area between the night and the dawn, between the facts and the truth, between our hearts and our thighs. Oh, Lord, let them who are without sin cast the first stone.
HILARIOUS
Ladies and Gentlemen . . . (she gestures towards Khurve)
HAVING REMOVED HER KIMONO TO REVEAL A SKIMPY RED SHOWGIRL COSTUME
THE THIRD METHOD OF CHANGING SCENERYposes between banners and sings accompanied by piano music. She points to and touches parts of her body suggestively while singing a classic burlesque number in the style of “Adam and Eve ” by Gypsy Rose Lee.
KHURVE
(at center, addressing the audience) Well, I haven’t done that one in a long, long, long time. They didn’t like that one at all, oh no, those big, strong pencils and padlocks. They used to sit in the music hall with their seersucker knees up on the seat in front of them, writing so fast with their pencils you woulda thought they were lunatics conducting an orchestra. And then they’d close down
HILARIOUS
(entering and dragging her away from her picturetaking) Really, Jo, you are old enough to leave off your boyish tricks, and behave better. It didn’t matter so much when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.
LOUISA
I’m not a young lady! And if turning up my hair makes me one I’ll wear it in two tails until I’m twenty! It’s bad enough to he a girl anyway, when I like boys’ games and work and manners. It’s worse than ever now, for I’m dying to go to the war and fight with Papa, and I can only stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman! There is so much to do about the play tomorrow night.
KHURVE
(in a tone of exasperation) That play!
HILARIOUS
Now listen, Jo. I don’t mean to act any more, after this time. I’m getting too old for such things.
LOUISA
Oh, you can’t stop, Meg. Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene, for you’re as stiff as a poker in that.
KHURVE
I can’t help, Jo. I never saw anyone faint, and I don’t choose to make myself all black and blue, tumbling down flat, as you do. If I can go down easily, I’ll drop. If I can’t, I shall fall into a chair and be graceful. I don’t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol.
LOUISA
Well, do it this way. Clasp your hands in front of you - so. And then stagger across the room, crying frantically (she becomes very dramatic) “Roderigo! Roderigo! Save me! Save me!” (She utters a wild scream, and falls down in a heap on the floor. Meg applauds) . . . Now come on, Amy. You do it!
KHURVE
(looking like a martyr) Oh dear! (She sticks her hands out stiffly before her, and stumbles across the stage giving a feeble imitation of Jo’s performance) Roderigo! Roderigo! Save me, save me!
LOUISA
Scream, Amy! Scream!
KHURVE
Owwww! (She moans as if having an orgasm and then drops daintily down into the chair. Meg and Jo laugh)
LOUISA
It’s no use. Do your best when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don’t blame me.
KHURVE
(in the blackout) Excuse me. Could you roll that back? I’d like to see that again. (Lights up. They all faint. Blackout)
HILARIOUS
(in the blackout) How would you like to be the third girl on, in the Pickle Persuader Bit?
KHURVE
Me? In the Pickle Persuader Bit?
HILARIOUS
First, you cross stage center, with a yackety-yak. Then you do the double clinch and put the newspaper bit under your neck. Then we segue into the fairy godmother finish. I get the seltzer water in the pants.
KHURVE
When do I get to rehearse?
HILARIOUS
You just did, honey.

HILARIOUS
I hope nothing’s happened to Jo. You know how Jo hates to ask a favor of anyone - and particularly Aunt March.
KHURVE
Well, when your father is sick in the hospital, and your mother has to go to Washington and take care of him, and she needs money to stay there, it’s time to come down off your high horse, and ask a favor.
HILARIOUS
Jo did, my dear. As soon as we read Marmee’s letter, she put her pride in her pocket, and went straight to Aunt
KHURVE
What if Aunt March won’t give her the money?
HILARIOUS
Amy, don’t mention such a thing!
KHURVE
Well, Jo has a very unfortunate way with her.
HILARIOUS
You’re out of sorts today, Amy.
KHURVE
Well, who wouldn’t be? Last night Laurie came over to take Jo to the theatre, and it was a play I particularly wanted to see. And I asked Jo to take me, and offered to pay my own way, out of my rag money. And she wouldn’t take me.
HILARIOUS
It wouldn’t have been polite for you to go when you weren’t invited.
KHURVE
If Jo had just taken a little trouble, I might have been invited.
HILARIOUS
You shouldn’t have been angry with Jo about that, Amy.
KHURVE
I was angry with her. And still am! So there! . .. There she is!
LOUISA ENTERS PULLING A LARGE CLOUD LABELED
“CHAPTER XXXV
HILARIOUS
Jo, dear!
LOUISA
Hello, everybody!
HILARIOUS
Jo, we’ve been worried about you. Have you had a bad time?
KHURVE
Did you get the money?
LOUISA
There! Never say this family doesn’t have a bread winner! (She trips and falls and loses her wig and hat , exposing the performer’s real hair)
HILARIOUS
Your hair! You’ve cut your beautiful hair!
KHURVE
Jo! How could you? Your one beauty!
HILARIOUS
Jo, darling, you’re magnificent!
KHURVE
Didn’t you feel dreadfully when the first cut came? (She voices disgust at having to continue with the script)
LOUISA
What’s the matter?
KHURVE
Nothing.
LOUISA
We were in the middle of a scene.
KHURVE
Yeah, well I didn’t like it.
LOUISA
I was under the impression that you were an actress by profession.
KHURVE
How did you know? Do you know my mother? Or have you see my movies?
HILARIOUS
She doesn’t have to see your movies to know your mother. No. I mean she doesn’t have to see your mother to know your movie. No. I mean she doesn’t have to know your movies or see your mother to know what kind of woman you seem to be.
KHURVE
What is that supposed to mean?
HILARIOUS
I think Shakespeare said it very well
KHURVE
I foxtrot and I jitterbug but the rest 1 don’t know squat about it . . .
LOUISA
Don’t you think now that we’re in Heaven we should try to get along?
HILARIOUS
This is more like HELL than Heaven! I don’t understand the Heaven where you are.
LOUISA
That’s very lyrical, Hilarious. (She sings) I don’t understand! The Heaven where you are . . .
HILARIOUS
(kneeling and praying loudly) Almighty God! In your infinite wisdom please show me the reason why these amoral women . . .
KHURVE
There’s no reason to pray, we’re already up here.
HILARIOUS
. . . have achieved the stature of your grace ... I have devoted my earthly life to gestures of grace and then I pass on and these are my deserts . . .
KHURVE
Desserts?
LOUISA
Deserts in the sense of getting what one deserves. Late or destiny is a constant theme in human history. As a writer I tried to separate destiny from the concepts of good and evil.
KHURVE
Oh honey, what a relief.
LOUISA
(spluttering with feeling and enthusiasm) ... so that I could capture character . . . and character is beyond judgement . . .
KHURVE
(to Hilarious) Hey, look! She spits when she talks also! Did you see that! She spits when she talks!
LOUISA
. . . and that is the essence of righteousness to me . . . allowing character without judgement ... I felt like God when writing . . . I had the fates of these people in my hands . . . and I treated them kindly and simply . . . and my readers wanted more cruelty from me but I frustrated them with kindness. I worried, oh God, I was up many nights . . . those candles on plates I used, burnt down one after another in a row along the window ... it was that struggle between what my dear readers wanted and what I myself believed . . . like being in middle management. The whole struggle . . . you know . . .
KHURVE
I was into that too really . . . pretending to be people. It’s Hilarity I don’t get. Why do they let Hilarity in here?
HILARIOUS
Hilarious. Hilarious . . . Didn’t you learn any Latin?
KHURVE
No, but I French pretty good . . .
HILARIOUS
I am displaced ... I am disgraced ... I am disgusted . . . I am shocked ... To have God on my right and this hussy on my left . . .
KHURVE
Who is on your right?
HILARIOUS
God. God. God! I could have had many lovers. But I turned the corner. I had my human nature in one pocket and the will of God in the other.
LOUISA
What is the will of God?
KHURVE
The will! The will! It’s when someone dies and they say in a piece of paper who gets their stuff.
HILARIOUS
. . . it’s easier to see the will of God than to act on it! The woman in the church with the silk scarf! I let her go! After one song I knew every shadow of the blue of her eye and I let her go! And my mother’s brother’s secrets! I never told them! And I killed a suffering animal! I hate blood! I crushed its head with a rock! And I believed all the things I said to people! I believed I would go to Heaven and that the heavenly kingdom was the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Jesus Christ his one and only son! I believed that! I believed that! And I was a liar! And here I am in Heaven! And the reason I was a liar was that I believed that Heaven was heavenly! And I haven’t seen God yet! And all I’ve seen is some heathen pagan bookworm and a strumpet! I just can’t understand.
KHURVE
Me? You can’t understand me? I think you understand real well. I got nothin’ to apologize for. I never made no deals. I did what I did and I never asked nothin’ and I never tried to hide from anyone anything. Me and my mother were real close and I made my movies and that’s it. No, that’s not really it, I did live shows for a while too. But they were behind a wall with peepholes
LOUISA
Suddenly the garden grows quiet. We hear things. Larks. Finches. Two clouds part. Some blue sky shines through. And the right hand of reason turns to go as the left hand, the lover, the counterpart, says . . .
KHURVE
Now, at last I’ve found you. (She starts back to the stage) LOUISA
HILARIOUS
Excuse me? (She heads back to the stage)
LOUISA
And she would say . . .
KHURVE
It is you that I have.
LOUISA
And she would say . . .
HILARIOUS
Madam . . .
LOUISA
And she would say . . .
KHURVE
. . . waited for LOUISA
HILARIOUS
Madam, please . . .
LOUISA
And she would say . . .
KHURVE
I throw myself at your feet.
LOUISA
And she would say . . .
HILARIOUS
I beg your pardon.
LOUISA
And she would say . . .
KHURVE
This is the thing I have waited for, the moment I’ve searched for.
LOUISA
And she would say . . .
HILARIOUS
I cannot.
LOUISA
And she would say . . .
KHURVE
The longing I have longed for.
LOUISA
And she would say . . .
HILARIOUS
I . . . I . . .
LOUISA
And she would say . . .
KHURVE
You ... you . . .
LOUISA
Hit it, Maestro! (She exits, leaving them to get on with it)
LOUISA
(interrupting the most explicit sexual position) Hold the music! (The music stops. Hilarious and Khurve freeze)
LOUISA
Has anyone seen my book? The one with my new story. The one we all thought was good enough to sell? I left it on my bureau last night when I went to the theater.
HILARIOUS
Maybe it’s in the attic with your other manuscripts. LOUISA/JO
KHURVE
Why, I have not!
HILARIOUS
Now, Jo!
LOUISA
And you needn’t take her part, Meg March. The last time, she turned my bureau drawer upside down on the floor.
KHURVE
I haven’t got your old book.
LOUISA
Well you know something about it, and you’d better tell at once or I’ll make you!
KHURVE
Scold as much as you like, you’ll never get your silly old story again.
LOUISA
Why not?
KHURVE
I burnt it up.
HILARIOUS
Amy!
LOUISA
What, my little book I was so fond of and worked over and meant to finish before Father got home? Have you really burnt it up?
KHURVE
Yes I did. I told you I’d make you pay for not letting me go to the theater with you and Laurie and I have, so there!
LOUISA
You wicked, wicked girl, I never can write it again and I’ll never forgive you as long as I live! (She exits)
HILARIOUS
(trying to save the scene) Hit it, Maestro!
HILARIOUS
(standing and dusting herself off) This is the foulest perversion of sex ever attempted by theater baiters for dirty dollars.
LOUISA
Oh Meg! What shall I do? It seems as if I could do anything when I’m in a passion. I’ve never eaten any meat and I’m still cross and irritable. I’m afraid I shall do something dreadful someday and spoil my life and make everybody hate me. Oh Meg! Help me!
HILARIOUS
Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. You think your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like it.
LOUISA
Yours, Meg? Why, you are never angry!
HILARIOUS
I’ve been trying to cure it for many years, and have only succeeded in controlling it. I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo; but I have learned not to show it.
LOUISA
Tell me how you do it, Meg dear.
HILARIOUS
I’ve learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and when I feel they mean to break out against my will, I just go away a minute and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked.
HILARIOUS EXITS AND LOUISA TURNS TO THE AUDIENCE AND WALKS DOWNSTAGE
Are there any questions?
LOUISA
Any questions? (She asks for and answers questions from the audience during the course of the monologue. She must attempt to answer the questions as truthfully as possible either as the character of Louisa or as the performer herself. She is down stage center) Any other questions? (She bends and begins to untie her left shoe) I guess I’m really not too interested in your questions, I am far more interested in my own. Oh, I know that is dreadfully selfish. Dreadfully selfish for a woman, so are there any questions? I am so glad you liked Little Women, and your daughter Jenny loved it, it changed her life. It gave her everything she needed to carry in the suitcase of her memory on her journey toward womanhood. That is wondrous. You know, I never really wanted to be a literary nursemaid. (She bends to remove the shoe) I plodded away, but I didn’t enjoy such things, perhaps I should wear my shoe on my nose. Here. (She balances the shoe on her face momentarily, then removes it) How do you like it? This shoe is Little Women. And what if I were known for wearing my shoe on my nose? Would I go to the market that way? Should I spend the rest of my life being loved for that part of myself that I despise? (To the audience) Is there another question? (She responds to a real or imaginary question with this answer) Those necessity stories? The potboilers, the thrillers, that wasn’t me, that was someone else. I never swung in a tree. What would I be doing in a tree? I’m a dutiful daugh-
TER
Power! I nursed the bodies of four hundred men, four hundred men’s bodies, whose touch froze me and whose kisses covered my nose like a shoe. (She balances the shoe on her face briefly, until it falls and she retrieves it) And they screamed with pain. But what is their pain when compared to mine? What is the wound of a gun or a sword compared to the other wounds, the lie, the lies of the Little Women} I’m afraid my shoe has slipped off my nose. And I must go in now and knit. (She crosses up stage and right) Oh, I know there is a war afoot, but I must go in and knit, because war is not for women unless it’s the war within. Is there one more question? (Pause) Thank you. (She curtsies and exits)

HOW TO DIVIDE SKY INTO SECTIONS and, as she exits, runs into Khurve wearing large fake tits and ass. As Khurve exits she runs into Louisa carrying a cloud labeled

You know I’m the kind of girl who climbed the ladder of success.

How?
KHURVE
Wrong by wrong.

STOP THE MUSIC! What’s going on?

I’m leaving.

What about us?
LOUISA
I don’t like you anymore.
HILARIOUS
You don’t like us?
LOUISA
Well ... I don’t like living with you.
KHURVE
Oh, get over it sweetie. That’s like saying you don’t like living with your legs.
LOUISA
My legs are none of your business!
KHURVE AND HILARIOUS
Oh no?
KHURVE
Could you roll that back please? I’d like to see that again.
LOUISA
Hit it, Maestro!
KHURVE
I used to be terribly ashamed of the way I lived.
LOUISA
Did you reform?
KHURVE
No.
LOUISA
So what happened?
KHURVE
I’m not ashamed anymore.

I gotta get out of here.

“CHAPTER XLIII
KHURVE
I wrote this show myself. It’s the story of a girl who lost her reputation . . . but never missed it!
HILARIOUS
( entering) She did miss it! She missed it terribly! LOUISA
KHURVE
You wrote that book\
LOUISA
I want to write a different book!
KHURVE AND HILARIOUS
What shall we do?
LOUISA
Do what you want.
KHURVE
(to Hilarious) What do we want?
HILARIOUS
We want her to stay.
LOUISA
That’s not what you want.
KHURVE
How do you know what everybody thinks?
LOUISA
Because I’m the writer.
HILARIOUS
Stay.
LOUISA
Don’t push me.
KHURVE
We’re doing what we want.
LOUISA
Oh please ... let me think.
HILARIOUS
Thoughts . . .
KHURVE
We both look like thoughts!
LOUISA
{mad) You look like the process of thinking!
HILARIOUS
What are you talking about?
LOUISA
Why are you both so . . .
HILARIOUS
I came home to go to Amy’s wedding. I loved Amy so much, and my mother must have seen that in me while I was getting dressed. I let myself take forever getting dressed to watch Amy get married. My mother saw my love. She loved me, my mother. I put on a white suit, beautiful tailored white, as if Amy was going to marry me, and my mother watched me. I dressed in my mother’s memories. I could tell, because she told me how handsome I looked in my suit, and she smiled that smile of memory. Then I put on my gold cufflinks and tiepin, and I was my father. I looked just like my father, she said, and she remembered him. And then I shined my shoes, and her smile got even deeper, and I looked just like my father she said, and then I put on my white Panama hat. I think she wanted me to kiss her hand . . . and all of a sudden the spell was broken ... I turned from her to leave for the wedding and her face fell and she forgot that I was her lover and she said, I hope you don’t think you’re going out dressed like that?
LOUISA
{to the audience) Any questions?
HILARIOUS
I can see through you, do you want to take a chance I can outdo you, through the action of romance I’m even better in a moment of despair I even get my heart all tangled in your hair
LOUISA
(to the audience) I’d like to sit down .. . (She looks around for a place to rest) I’d like to sit down. (A swing on a white silk rope descends from the ceiling. Louisa walks over and sits) So this is Heaven. Oh, it feels so nice to give my weight to the earth as it passes through a chair or through the grass, or . . . even gravity itself! The way the earth has of not letting me go ... as though I’m greatly beloved!
KHURVE
(enters and stands behind Louisa on the swing) You see me. Come on, admit it. You see me. Look. Look at this. Look at me. Don’t sit next to me without looking at me.
LOUISA
I used to love to sit, I used to wander. I had wanderlust . . . oh . ..
KHURVE
I’m like a tract of land, I want you to look, I want you to look at me, buy me, look at me, build on me, mine and shave me. Make a house on me and bury your dead . . .
LOUISA
Children are so funny.
KHURVE
All the way in me.
LOUISA
I used to have a path I followed, always the same path. It went to a spring. I used to wait till it was almost dark and follow this well-known path, as if it were the very first time. I rehearse my surprises you know ... ha ha ha .. . And then I’d get there, to the spring! It came as a great and delicious shock every day of my life to see it there like it waited for me ... it had no other friends but me. And I reached my hands into that spring and it was so cold, oh my god so cold. On the hottest day it was snow in motion. It
KHURVE
I’m talking to you.
LOUISA
Someone waiting for me . . .
KHURVE
I’m talking to you in heartbeat.
LOUISA
There’s someone sitting next to me.
KHURVE
I’m talking heartbeat to you.
LOUISA
Who are you?
KHURVE
You see me.
LOUISA
Who are you?
KHURVE
You see me.
LOUISA
What do you want?
KHURVE
You want me.
LOUISA
It was just a fantasy but how real it seemed . . . children are so funny.
KHURVE
Don’t act like you don’t see me. I come. I come.
LOUISA
Someone sitting next to me . . .
KHURVE
Did you know I come?
LOUISA
Facing whatever way I faced. If I faced the mountain, she faced the mountain.
KHURVE
This is what I am, and I want it that way.
LOUISA
If I faced town, she faced town.
KHURVE
Look at me.
LOUISA
If I laid down and faced the sun . . . she lay down next to me.
KHURVE
Why won’t you talk about it?
LOUISA
So I never saw her, I couldn’t see her.
KHURVE
Look! Look what a lover I am. You want me . . . say it!
LOUISA
I find communion through understanding. I find these springs in my mind, full of surprises. Manageable surprises.
KHURVE
I’m getting fat like the earth, who’s fatter than me. She’s a huge fat lady with fat thighs made of water.
LOUISA
The spring was a manageable surprise. It was drinkable.
KHURVE
And the fatter I get the tighter she holds me.
LOUISA
I would have liked to turn her.
KHURVE
She wants me back.
LOUISA
I would have liked to turn her.
KHURVE
She wants me back.
LOUISA
This friend of mine . . . but after you sit . . .
KHURVE
I’m getting big . . .
LOUISA
Side by side . . .
KHURVE
I’m overwhelming . . .
LOUISA
. .. for so many years as a child . . .
KHURVE
I’m going to overwhelm you . . .
LOUISA
It’s hard to face someone . . .
KHURVE
Look over here . . . I’m huge . . . my thighs won’t close
LOUISA
But I love them, I love my gardening, my reading, my work. KHURVE
LOUISA
And this companion . . .

You see me . . . Talk to me . . . Don’t say no to me . . . LOUISA
KHURVE
Don’t say no to me!
LOUISA
She’s . . .
HILARIOUS
(stepping upstage of Louisa and Kburve in the swing so that they are all framed by the rope) The ball rolls round and round and where it stops is of no concern to me! Because I’m not playing by the rules, as I’m not included in the rewards. I’m not the one you think I am. I sparkle in your eyes for a moment before you condemn me to a pit not realizing that by doing so you will never see me again for eternity. Include me in your will of dreams. Take me with you as you fly to desire and your breasts are finally yours and your tears are your tears of your own joy and not of others. Reach forward as far as you can and try and touch me. Through me you can rock and roll. Through me you can see the supper table spread with delicacies from every country and tea and flesh and all that we can afford. Touch me without your face covered by your fingers, without the shame of champagne and burgundy, without the shame of the players who put down less than they take up. You will be awarded with my desire. You will be awarded with

(to Khurve) Where did you get that suitcase?
HILARIOUS
That’s not your suitcase!
LOUISA
Yours was green.
HILARIOUS
It was plaid.

HILARIOUS
I saw it.
LOUISA
I’m the writer!

Who cares?

I took it but I didn’t steal it!
LOUISA
I said I created you!
HILARIOUS
Did you hear that?

There are plenty of them!

You\ (she grabs Hilarious by her collar) I was awake all night over! But you (she grabs Khurve’s hand on the suitcase handle) just came to me quickly in the afternoon!
HILARIOUS
God!
LOUISA
Where?
KHURVE
Dunno.

MITCH
You know that they excrete something to digest your blood, that’s why they leave that bump on your skin.
STELLA
I always worry that they carry things with them, transferring them from person to person.
MITCH
That’s an old wives’ tale. This country has no tradition of disease being spread by mosquitoes. You’re mistaken.
STELLA
Well, every year I make one big mistake. I wonder what it will be this year?
MITCH
This mistake, is it at a particular time, or can’t you tell when it’s coming?
STELLA
I can usually feel it coming . . .
BLANCHE
( from inside the box) I’ve always depended on the strangeness of strangers.
STELLA
Or at least after the fact I thought I knew it was coming. MITCH
MITCH
Change the script!
STELLA
Change the script. Ha ha. You want me to do what in these shoes? The script is not the problem. I’ve changed the script.
MITCH
It’s a start.
STELLA
Look, I’m supposed to wander around in a state of narcotized sensuality. That’s my part. (Blanche and Stanley speak simultaneously from inside the two largest boxes)
BLANCHE
You didn’t see. Miss Stella, see what I saw, the long parade to the graveyard. The mortgage on the house, death is expensive, Miss Stella, death is expensive.
STANLEY
Is that so? You don’t say, hey Stella wasn’t we happy before she showed up. Didn’t we see those colored lights you and me. Didn’t we see those colored lights.
STELLA
And anyway, it’s too late. It’s already started.
STANLEY
Hey Stella! (He comes out of the stage right box)
MITCH
No, there’s plenty for both of us. Don’t feel singled out. STELLA
STELLA
Don’t holler at me like that, Stanley.
STANLEY
Hey Stella, Stella baby! Catch! (He throws her a package wrapped in bloody paper)
STELLA
What!
STANLEY
Meat.
BLANCHE
( emerging from the stage left box) Are we here? Is this the place? Are my necessaries disembarked? How sweet it is to arrive at a new place for the first time. The future stretching out in front of us like a clean, white carpet. There’s the stir and rustle of endless possibility in the air.
STANLEY
You don’t say.
STELLA
Honey, we’re in exactly the same place we started out from.
BLANCHE
Started out? What do you mean started out? You mean we haven’t arrived?
STELLA
No, we haven’t arrived, but don’t worry about that now. You just take it easy.
STANLEY
Something smells fishy around here and it’s not me.
STELLA
(to Stanley) Now you be kind to my sister. Tell her how nice she looks.
BLANCHE
I can’t stand being in between. I just can’t bear it.
STELLA
(to Stanley) You should try to understand her a little better, she’s just different.
STANLEY
Different? You can say that again.
BLANCHE
I have never regretted my decision to be unique.
STANLEY
I’m gonna put an end to this charade here and now.
BLANCHE
(as Stanley moves to center stage with a trunk and becomes a customs agent) That my plans of late have gone somewhat awry is the price one has to pay if life is to be superb.
STANLEY
(to Blanche) Ticket please.
BLANCHE
(to Mitch) Young man, don’t I know you?
MITCH
We were engaged to be married.
STANLEY
Ticket please!
BLANCHE
Did I break your heart?
MITCH
No, you broke my leg.
BLANCHE
I must be stronger than I thought.
STANLEY
Ticket please!
BLANCHE
Oh, well, all right, I have it here somewhere. (She rummages through her bag) Which ticket do you mean, the one that got me here or the one that will take me away?
STANLEY
Both.
BLANCHE
Oh, well I don’t seem to have either at the moment. Although we must have gotten here somehow, we can’t have walked, we have a heavy load. However, I present myself as overwhelming evidence that I am actually here.
STANLEY
While we’re at it, I’m gonna need your passport.
BLANCHE
Passport? I wasn’t aware that we were crossing any borders. What borders?
STANLEY
Passport.
BLANCHE
( rummaging around) Passport, passport . . . (Mitch steps forward with her passport and hands it to Stanley)
STANLEY
(still staring at Mitch) Name?
BLANCHE
Blanche DuBois.
STANLEY
That’s not what it says here.
BLANCHE
I assure you that is who I am. My namesake is a role played by that incandescent star, Vivien Leigh, and although the resemblance is not immediately striking I have been told we have the same shoulders.
STANLEY
(looking at the passport photo) Then who’s this here?
BLANCHE
The information in that document is a convention which allows me to pass in the world without let or hindrance. If you’ll just notice the message inside the front cover, The Queen of England herself not only requests this but requires it.
STANLEY
You don’t look anything like this photograph.
BLANCHE
I believe nature is there to be improved upon.
STANLEY
You’re lying.
BLANCHE
Well, that’s one way of looking at it.
STANLEY
Is there another?
BLANCHE
You wouldn’t treat me like this if I wasn’t at the end of my rope!
STANLEY
(slamming his fist on the trunk) But ya are Blanche, ya are.
BLANCHE
What was that?
STANLEY
Cats. I’m afraid I’m going to have to perform an intimate search.
BLANCHE
My body?
STANLEY
Your luggage.
BLANCHE
Stella, how do I look?
STELLA
Fresh as a daisy.
STANLEY
One that’s been picked a few days.
MITCH
Look, can’t we just scrub ’round the search and get on with the scenes of brutal humiliation and sexual passion?
STANLEY
I’m afraid we have to find a motive in this case, and I believe it’s in this trunk. (To Mitch) Why don’t you mind your own business?
BLANCHE
How dare you speak to my ex-fiance like that!
STANLEY
Your ex-fiance?! This man is your ex-fiance?
BLANCHE
That’s right.
MITCH
I told her I loved her and she pushed me down the stairwell, but I forgave her as any decent man would.
STANLEY
That’s not what it says in the script. In the script it says you treated her like shit because you’re a stuck-up mommy’s boy.
MITCH
That’s a lie!
BLANCHE
I think I’m going to faint.
STELLA
Is all this really necessary?
STANLEY
Look, have you any idea how many people we have come in here saying they’re Blanche DuBois, clutching tiny handbags and fainting in the foyer? I’m afraid I’ll have to subject this case to the closest possible scrutiny before I allow any of you to pass any further.
BLANCHE
I see, you want me to come clean by showing my dirty laundry to the world.
STANLEY
You got it.
BLANCHE
I think I’ll go into the dressing room and burst into tears. STELLA
STELLA
She threw herself at the feet of an unforgiving world to prove her identity.
MITCH
The answer was somewhere in that trunk.
STANLEY
(thumping his fist on the trunk as the music and lights stop flashing) This is gonna cost you, lady. What did you think you were gonna get a free ride or something? (About to open the trunk ) What do we have here?
BLANCHE
Please open the doors one at a time! If you open them all at once pink things and fur things, dainty things, delicate and wistful things might pop out.
STANLEY
I’ll open them one at a time. First things first. (Music starts. Stanley pulls out a jacket and tosses it to Stella, then pulls out a scarf and throws it to Mitch)
BLANCHE
I won’t take it personally the way you’re treating everything I own in the world.
STANLEY
Let’s see, what are little girls made of? (He sings) I put my right hand in, I pull my right hand out (he pulls it out empty and laughs ), I put my right hand in (he pulls out a dress on a hanger and puts it around his neck) and I shake it all about.
BLANCHE
I can’t approve of any of this, just as you can’t approve of my entire life.
STANLEY
I do the hokey-pokey and I turn myself around. That’s what it’s all about. So this is what little girls are made of. Tiaras, diamond tiaras. (He puts a tiara on his head) And what’s this? (He pulls out a gold bracelet and puts it on) A solid gold Cadillac. This must be worth a fortune. And what have we got here? A box of valuables. (He tosses the contents onto the floor) Love letters, scrap books, newspaper clippings.
BLANCHE
Everybody has something they don’t want others to touch because of their intimate nature.
STANLEY
(singing, as Mitch picks up the newspaper clippings) I put my right foot in, I take my right foot out, I put my right foot in and I shake it all about . . . (Stanley pulls out a high-heeled shoe)
MITCH
(as Stanley continues singing) There was a time when everyone was trying to get a piece of her. These are the pieces left
BLANCHE
(as Mitch bands her the newspaper clippings) I don’t see how any of this relates to my own life except in the way people perceive my fall.
STANLEY
I put my left hand in . . . (he shakes the box violently from inside)
BLANCHE
(ripping up the newspaper clippings) Tearing ... I hear tearing ... be careful . . . the wings, you’re tearing them!
STANLEY
They’re just animals, lady, what’s the matter with you?
BLANCHE
But they’ve been faithful their whole lives. There are things we don’t know here.
STANLEY
Things are different now. (Still struggling inside the box) I pull the white-feathered excited body of one swan off the white-feathered excited body of another swan. (He pulls out a handful of feathers)
BLANCHE
What right have you to interfere with nature?
STANLEY
(pulling feathers apart to reveal that they are a boa which he drapes across his shoulders) And shake it all about.
BLANCHE
Birds of a feather.
STANLEY
I put my left hand in . . . (he pulls his hand quickly out) Oww, Stella, Stella!
STELLA
What?
STANLEY
I burned my hand.
STELLA
Oh, Stanley, it’s just candle wax. STANLEY
STELLA
Some people think it’s sexy.
STANLEY
(pulling his hand away from her) I can see where it might be sexy if I knew it was coming. I put my left hand in, I pull my left hand out . . . oh, a little cheerleading doll . . . (he breaks off the arm) the arm is busted . . the rubber band must be broken inside.
BLANCHE
My mother gave me that.
STANLEY
(dancing the doll on top of the trunk) And I shake it all about . . .
BLANCHE
And before that, it was her mother’s.
STANLEY
(slamming the doll down) Look, lady, I’m just trying to do my job here.
BLANCHE
This contains all of my hopes and dreams . . . this is my hope chest.
STANLEY
Hopes and dreams? Forget it. (He sticks his hand into the purse) I put my whole body in, I take my whole body out. (He pulls out a scarf) I grab myself a frilly thing and shake it all about. I pin it on my shoulders and I sashay up and down, that’s what it’s all about. Yes? I put my right hand in, I take my right hand out . . . (He pulls out his hand covered in blood. Blanche and Stella exit. Mitch enters in fading light to roll away the trunk; music and lights slowly fade out. In blackout) I am suddenly aware that the atmosphere has changed. It’s dark. The night has a thousand eyes and they’re all looking at me. They’re burning into me, burning into my chest. If I don’t sleep now, I never will . . . don’t panic . . . the night seems to last forever . . . don’t panic . . I’m scared, I’m wrong, the night is making me feel . . . (The lights return suddenly on a curtain with a painting of an oversized clawed foot of a bathtub and a straight razor lying on a tiled floor. Stella is onstage with Stanley. She is wearing a cheerleading outfit and carries a cheerleading doll) Vivien Leigh, huh? Okay, that’s your story and I’m stuck with it for now. But let’s see if you can keep up the deception day after day, week after week in front of me. Let that be a challenge to our relationship. But meanwhile, relax, make yourself at home, have a drink. Tell me about yourself, stuff I haven’t heard before, recent stuff like how’ve you been lately. I got all the time in the world and I’m all ears.
STELLA
Stanley, you come out here and let Blanche finish dressing. (Stanley exits) I let her keep her hopes and dreams, just like I let her keep her cheerleading memories. I pretended they were mine as well, came to know them as I know my own face in the mirror. A face that was not a twin of my older sister.
BLANCHE
(entering stage left in a bathrobe) I think I handled that really well. It’s a tricky business, deception in the face of legal documents. Thank heavens for bathrooms, they always make me feel so new.
STELLA
Blanche, honey, are you all right in there? There was no answer, but I could hear her splashing and the sound of her radio.
BLANCHE
I can always refresh my spirits in the bathroom.
STELLA
Blanche, I brought you your lemon Coke.
BLANCHE
Yes, of course.
STANLEY
And my job is to make sure you’re not smuggling something personal in this here trunk. (He reaches into the trunk) Let’s see, what’s this? And what is this? (He pulls out a purse)
BLANCHE
All right sweetie. Be right out.
STELLA
I’ll wait out here.
BLANCHE
I don’t want you to have to wait on me.
STELLA
I like waiting on you Blanche, it feels more like home. BLANCHE
STELLA
Well, I’m waiting.
BLANCHE
One day I’ll probably just dissolve in the bath. They’ll come looking for me, but there’ll be nothing left. “Drag Queen Dissolves in Bathtub,” that’ll be the headline. “All that was left was a full head of hair clogging up the plughole. She was exceptional even in death ...” I wonder where I’ll end up. In the sea, I suppose.
STELLA
I’m waiting, Blanche.
BLANCHE
Just a few last finishing touches.
STELLA
Waiting. Waiting in the wings. Waiting for her to get off the phone.
BLANCHE
You wouldn’t want me to go out looking a mess, now would you?
STELLA
Waiting for her to come home from Woolworth’s with the new Tangee lipstick. And when 1 wasn’t waiting I was following. I used to follow her into the bathroom. I loved the way she touched her cheek with the back of her hand. How she let her hand come to rest just slightly between her breasts as she took one last look in the mirror. I used to study the way she adjusted her hips and twisted her thighs in that funny way when she was changing her shoes. Then she would fling open the bathroom door and sail down the staircase into the front room to receive her gentlemen callers.
BLANCHE
(colliding into Stella, who drops the doll ) My doll, it’s broken!
STELLA
(laughingly) No it isn’t.
BLANCHE
I did. I broke it.
STELLA
No, honey. You didn’t.
BLANCHE
Yes I did. I broke it.
STELLA
(shaking Blanche) No, Blanche, it was already broken.
BLANCHE
I don’t know why I’m like this today.
STELLA
(embracing her) Blanche, you know what this reminds me of? My homecoming corsage, remember? Before the homecoming
BLANCHE
And I pinned it on your shoulder and you were so proud of its size and excited by the smell of it.
STELLA
I felt every bit as tall and glamorous as the real cheerleaders, the majorettes, the homecoming court, even Miss Mississippi herself. I stood in that November air imagining all the things a grownup woman could be . . . and then, that great big old football player came walking across the red dirt and smacked right into me.
BLANCHE
And your poor corsage, it started to bleed, it started to lose its petals one by one.
STELLA
And I started to cry. I threw a god-awful fit.
BLANCHE
You certainly did.
STELLA
My whole life was disappearing with those dropping petals. How was I going to present myself in the same parade with Miss Mississippi, her in her strapless gown and me with a handful of petals. But you put your big strong arms around me and set me right up there on the float with . . .
BLANCHE
The beauty queen herself. And there you were, all puffy-eyed and corsageless .. .
STELLA
Right next to the great white virgin, with her round bare shoulders and her rhinestone tiara.
BLANCHE
(As the music starts ) And I took your picture and it was in the papers. (Blanche takes off the bathrobe to reveal a cheerleading outfit and they sing)
BOTH
When life is unfair, and the world makes you sick I know somewhere that’s bliss on a stick.
STELLA
Somewhere to go when things are unsteady
BLANCHE
Somewhere to go with cocoa and teddy.
BOTH
Under the covers, the pillows and laces
STELLA
Lying together like spoons in a drawer
BLANCHE
Then turning over to have an explore . . .
BOTH
Under the covers, those smooth satin covers We share our dreams
STELLA
Like goose downy lovers
BLANCHE
Tucked in together like girls in the dorm
BOTH
Under the covers everything’s cozy and warm . . .
THEY PULL HIDDEN POM

BLANCHE
FABULOUS.
BOTH
Under the covers, it’s you and it’s me now
STANLEY
(yelling from backstage) Stella!
BLANCHE AND STELLA
She’d give us hell.
STANLEY
Stella!
BLANCHE AND STELLA
She’d give us ... (the song dissolves into laughter)
STANLEY
When are you hens gonna end that conversation? STELLA
STANLEY
Well, you can hear me, and I say hush up!
STELLA
This is my house too, Stanley, and I’ll talk as much as ...
BLANCHE
(interrupting her) Please don’t start another row, I couldn’t bear it . . . (She exits)
STELLA
I tried to follow her, but I got stuck. Stuck in the bathroom, where I saw myself in the medicine chest mirror. I stopped there and I stared. For three days I stared. I wasn’t her little sister. And in the mirror I saw the road split, and I took mine . ..
STANLEY
{grabbing Stella) Stella. (They bug; Stella exits; Stanley goes to the bathroom and starts shaving. The lights dim)
MITCH
(entering stage right. He carries a painting of a card table , which he places over the front of the square box) Now and then I reached out to touch his wrists. They glittered with a dozen golden bracelets that matched the large earrings he wore. He was like a shimmering waterfall of gold, his whole front covered with golden pendants that looked like coins. Beneath, he wore a purple semitransparent shift that matched the dark makeup around his large bedroom eyes. There was something both fierce and warm in his face. He was glowing with a pagan intensity that matched the intense feelings brimming up in my heart, which in turn matched the brimming purple wine that was being poured, seemingly without end, into our glittering golden goblets that matched the shafts of golden scorching sunlight that poured through the high windows down onto the banqueting table, where they were scattered in a dozen colors as they hit the gold in the glass. Finally, he rose from his throne, which was covered in a mantle of blue macaw feathers that cost ten dollars per square inch and matched the cerulean blue of the deep-piled carpet reputedly made by the tiny fingers of ten-year-old eunuchs within the forbidden city in Peking. Then he began to dance . . .
STANLEY
(grabbing Mitch by the shoulders) You know, a bum like me can grow up in a great country like this and be her lover, which is a hell of a better job than being president of the United States.
MITCH
You’re a lucky man.
STANLEY
You know, when I think about her, it’s like food, I want to eat her, just put her whole leg in my mouth, or her face, or her hands .. .
MITCH
That’s a mouthful!
STANLEY
I feel so hungry when I think of her, I could eat my car, I could eat dirt, I could eat a brick wall. I have to, I have no choice. I have to touch things, and my hands bring them to my mouth.
MITCH
Your big hands!
STANLEY
Feelings grow inside me, and sometimes they fly out of me so fast and then smack, I’m out of control. When it comes to big hands, I have no competition. (Stanley takes a swig of beer)
PLATE
Sheila Burnett
MITCH
When it comes to big hands, she knows she’s got your big hands all over her. (He takes a swig)
STANLEY
(challenging him to arm wrestle) My big pioneer hands all over her rocky mountains.
MITCH
(taking the challenge) All over her livestock and vegetation. STANLEY
MITCH
Her thick forests and golden sunsets.
STANLEY
All over her stars!
MITCH
She’s in your hands!
STANLEY
She’s in my hands and . . . yeeaaa . . . (he pins Mitch's arms down)
MITCH
That’s right! Bite me! Bite me! Suck on me . . . oops. STANLEY
MITCH
Mosquitoes! Biting me, biting me . . .
STANLEY
(both of them slapping at hugs) Suck on me, suck on my body!
MITCH
What do you think I’m here for, your entertainment? A Coney Island for you?
STANLEY
A joyride on my ankle! A suck on my wrist! I’ll eliminate you! (He mimes a machine gun and makes a gun noise)
MITCH
Remove you from my space! Pow!
STANLEY
Away from my body, you aggravating hungry bugger. MITCH
STANLEY
You’re spoiled . . . Splat!
MITCH
You’re educated . . . Squash!
STANLEY
You remind me of my fate.
MITCH
You remind me of my immortality! Leave me my blood. STANLEY
MITCH
Bloody sheet.
STANLEY
Bloody night.
MITCH
Blood on your hand!
STANLEY
It’s my hand, I’m dealing the cards.
MITCH
(running after Stanley around the box) Deal me!
STANLEY
If you want another card I’ll hit you with it.
MITCH
Hit me!
STANLEY
When it comes to big hands I got no competition. MITCH
STANLEY
Your shuffle.
MITCH
Cut me in!
STANLEY
Throw your checkbook out the window!
MITCH
Empty my pockets!
STANLEY
I’m a royal flush, I win every time. (He challenges him to arm wrestle)
MITCH
(taking the challenge) I’m the last sailboat across the horizon before the sun sets.
STANLEY
Nobody can audition for my part.
MITCH
I flop and smash and throw things.
STANLEY
I turn and punch the air!
MITCH
I sweat.
STANLEY
I smell.
MITCH
I smell!
STANLEY
I smell of car oil, I smell of your blood.
MITCH
I smell of . . . cologne!
STANLEY
I’m hungry, ha, hungry! I’m gonna eat rough memories. MITCH
STANLEY
Digest hard words. Hard, hard words.
MITCH
I’m gonna spit them out!
STANLEY
It’s gonna cost you my hunger!
MITCH
I’m gonna pay!
STANLEY
( grabbing Mitch) I’m gonna eat my car. I’m gonna eat dirt!
MITCH
I’m gonna eat a tree! Eat your whole leg!
STANLEY
I’m gonna eat the sun and then I’ll sweat!
STANLEY AND MITCH
{in a frenzy) Bite me! Bite me! Suck on me!
BLANCHE
{opening the bathroom curtain and entering wearing a mans jacket, pants and cap) Suck my wrist.
STANLEY
When I was a little boy, at the age of five
STANLEY
(gradually noticing Blanche has a finger up her nose) Hold it, hold it. (To Blanche) Is there something I can help you with?
BLANCHE
Please could you give me a tissue. I think Pve got something stuck up my nose.
STANLEY
Would you like me to have a look?
BLANCHE
Please don’t trouble. I think a tissue would probably do it.
STANLEY
( handing her a tissue) Here.
BLANCHE
Probably a boogey, I expect.
STANLEY
An acquaintance of mine lost his sense of smell from having a booger stuck up his nose . . . better?
BLANCHE
Not really, no.
MITCH
Can I help?
BLANCHE
Oh no, please, it’s only something stuck up my nose. MITCH
STANLEY
Then blow your nose.
MITCH
Please let me look, I happen to be a doctor.
BLANCHE
It’s very kind of you.
MITCH
Turn around to the light please. Now look up. Now look down. Now look up again ... I can see it . . . keep still . . . (he twists the tissue and pokes it up her nose) There!
BLANCHE
Oh dear, what a relief, it was agonizing.
MITCH
(holding up the tissue) It looks like a piece of Christmas pudding.
BLANCHE
Thank you very much indeed.
MITCH
Not at all.
BLANCHE
How lucky for me you happened to be here. MITCH
BLANCHE
Never mind, you did and I’m most grateful. MITCH
BLANCHE
And that’s how it all began, just through me getting a booger stuck up my nose. (She takes off her cap, turns to face Stanley; then walks away upstage left as the lights dim and music starts. Mitch enters and motions for Blanche to dance with him , as Stanley shuffles a deck of cards)
STANLEY
Hey Mitch, you in this game or what?
MITCH
Deal me out. I’m talking to Miss DuBois. (They begin to dance as Stella wanders on)
STELLA
Look, we made enchantment.
STANLEY
Who turned that on? Turn it off.
STELLA
Ah-h-h-h let them have their music.
STANLEY
I said turn it off!
STELLA
What are you doing?
STANLEY
That’s the last time anybody plays music during my game. Now get OUT! OUT! (The music stops; Stella is laughing quietly)
STELLA
I guess you think that’s funny.
STANLEY
Yeah, I thought it was pretty funny.
STELLA
Well, maybe I blinked at the wrong time, ’cuz I missed the joke.
STANLEY
Oh, so now you’re an authority on what’s funny.
STELLA
I didn’t say that. I said I didn’t think that that was funny.
STANLEY
Well, if you know so much, why don’t you show me what is funny.
STELLA
Look, I don’t want to get twisted out of shape about it, I just didn’t think it was all that funny.
STANLEY
Oh, you thought it was just a little bit funny.
STELLA
No, not even a little bit funny.
STANLEY
So, show me!
STELLA
This is ridiculous.
STANLEY
Show me what’s funny.
STELLA
You want me to show you what’s funny.
STANLEY
Yeah, show me funny.
STELLA
Okay, I’ll show you funny . . . (She rips Stanley’s sleeve) That’s funny.
STANLEY
That was not funny.
STELLA
You want funny? (She rips off the other sleeve) That’s funny.
STANLEY
That was not funny.
STELLA
Okay. What about this? (She rips off half of Stanley’s shirt) Or this? (She rips off the other half)
STANLEY
That’s not funny.
STELLA
I’ll be right back. (She bustles offstage and comes hack with a seltzer bottle, then sprays Stanley) That was funny.
STANLEY
That was not funny.
STELLA
I’ll be right back. (She comes hack with a giant powder puff and powders Stanley) That was funny.
STANLEY
That’s not funny.
STELLA
I’ll be right back. (She comes hack with a cream pie. As she nears Stanley, Stanley unexpectedly tips it into Stella’s face)
STANLEY
Now that was funny. (Stanley exits. Mitch enters, pulling a curtain with a painting of a giant orchid. The Cassandra aria from Les Troyens comes on loudly, then fades)
MITCH
The bell sounds and they’re both middle weights. They know the rules, and they’ve been publicized as an even match. ’Ere, you’ve paid good money to see them, you want to see a battle, you want to see blood. Round One is I Love You, Round Two is You See Me For Who I Really Am. You never see a person more clearly than the first time they lay hands on you. After that, it’s all up for grabs. (To Stella) He’s gonna be back and he’s gonna say he’s sorry.
STELLA
(wiping the pie from her face) Sorry. (She laughs) Sorry . . . sorry, sorry, (laughs) The Indian women. The Indian women, wrapping their soft bodies in thick silk the colors of a church window. Sari, (laughs) I’m sorry too. It makes me laugh. They can’t take it back. What the gods give they cannot take back, they can only add to what they’ve given, to make the gift painful to have. Cassandra! Zeus gave her the gift of the seer, and then she wouldn’t have sex with him, but he couldn’t take back the gift. He couldn’t have her, so he made sure no one would believe her . . . She knew all those men were in that wooden horse, but they wouldn’t listen . . . (laughs) That’s hysterical. It was their loss, that curse! Zeus made a prophetess and then spit in her face. And just what do you think went on inside that horse? Hundreds of warlike men, spitting, smoking, dreaming death in the belly of a fake horse ... I dream a purple darkness . . . purple . . . the color of the sari . . . darlings. I’m
STELLA
Running wild, lost control Running wild, mighty bold Feeling gay, reckless too Carefree mind, all the time, never blue Always going - don’t know where Always showing - I don’t care Don’t love nobody, it’s not worthwhile All alone and running wild
STELLA
I’ve got a sweet little angel
STANLEY
(clapping loudly and talking to the audience) Is she good or what? She is so good . . . can you believe how good she is? (Stella stops singing) Any moment this dame spends out of bed is wasted, totally wasted. (Stanley runs to Stella and drops to his knees)
STELLA
I could smell you coming.
STANLEY
You say the sweetest things.
STELLA
Women have to develop a sense of smell. Just in general. Just as a matter of fact. Like in a war. In a war, you learn to smell
STANLEY
I am not your enemy.
STELLA
No . . . but you have many of the characteristics. Not that I go by appearances, just smell and instinct.
STANLEY
What are you looking for?
STELLA
You’re tense.
STANLEY
I’m always tense. It keeps me in check, keeps me in balance.
STELLA
It’s hard to watch.
STANLEY
That’s ’cuz you don’t know that it’s leading to something. STELLA
STANLEY
It’s a fact of life, you figure it out.
STELLA
I already did. I don’t have to spend long on the likes of you, not one as experienced as I am. I know that your tension is sexual, and it’s a desire that I share in, but not for your pleasure, for my own. I’m lookin’ for it, I might not find it in you, I might find it somewhere else, as a matter of fact, and there’s nothing you can do about it. You don’t satisfy me, you’re not real.
STANLEY
Are you saying I’m not a real man?
STELLA
I’m saying you’re not real. You’re cute. Could be much cuter if you weren’t quite so obvious.
STANLEY
Then it wouldn’t be me. I am not subtle.
STELLA
Try it, just for tonight.
STANLEY
You mean put it on like clothes? I couldn’t pull that off.
STELLA
No, take it off. Take it all off. I want to see what you’re really made of. I want to see what it is that makes me want you. That makes me want to have you as I’ve never had anyone. Strip. Take it off, then we’ll talk.
STANLEY
Talk is cheap.
STELLA
I want to see you naked like a baby.
STANLEY
No more talk, let’s make a deal.
STELLA
We are partners in this deal. I have my part, you have yours.
STANLEY
I can live up to my end of the deal, how ’bout you.
STELLA
Put your cards on the table, I’m calling your bluff. Blackout.
STANLEY
Hey, turn on the light!
STELLA
I like it in the dark.
STANLEY
I don’t like the dark, I like to see.
STELLA
(As the lights slowly fade up) You can see if you get your eyes used to it.
STANLEY
I don’t want to get used to it, I’m afraid of the dark.
PIANIST
I’ve got a sweet little angel
STELLA
The fire is keeping me awake. It reminds me of the night Yellow Mountain was burning. All night long I could see Yellow

MITCH
(A light behind the scrim reveals Blanche in a nightgown holding a cigarette and Mitch standing beside her. Mitch lights her cigarette) There’s a shadow over by the window. It’s a woman. She’s smoking a cigarette. (Blanche blows smoke into Mitch’s face; he coughs) The smoke is coming my way. Maybe she wants me to go with her. ( Blanches passes around the scrim and crosses to center stage , where she picks up Stanley’s torn T-shirt)
STELLA
The fire has leapt out of control. It’s too late, the firemen have all gone home to their wives. Had to hose down their own houses, to protect them from the falling debris.
BLANCHE
(examining Stanley’s shirt) This shirt smells of success to me. These elements of manhood . . . there’s something about Stanley I can’t quite put my finger on. I can’t put my finger on his smell. I don’t believe he’s a man. I question his sexuality. His postures are not real, don’t seem to be coming from a true place. He’s a phoney, and he’s got her believing it, and if she has children he’ll have them believing it and when he dies, they’ll find out. (She crosses to Stella) Have you ever seen him naked?
STELLA
(drinking Coke) It’s the sugar that satisfies me. The cool liquid running down my throat is only temporary. It’s when the sugar hits the bloodstream, that’s when my heart starts pumping.
BLANCHE
There’s something about the way he smells, something about the way he has to prove his manhood all the time, that makes me suspicious. I’m looking at the shape, not the content.
STELLA
(straddling the edge of the tub) Don’t you love that feeling when you lean against a solid surface and you can feel your heart beating under your body.
BLANCHE
The noises he makes, the way he walks like Mae West, the sensual way he wears his clothes, this is no garage-mechanic working-class boy, this is planned behavior. This is calculated sexuality, developed over years of picking up signals not necessarily genetic is what I’m trying to say.
STELLA
I remember leaning my abdomen against the cold sink and feeling my heart beating between my legs.
BLANCHE
I’m trying to say, what I mean is, perhaps he was a man in some former life. Perhaps he’s just a halfway house, to lure you into a sexual trap, a trap well laid, with just the right flavors, just
STELLA
The thing about Coca-Cola is that one sixteen-ounce bottle has more than four tablespoons of sugar.
BLANCHE
But now you have the chance to get out. To end this charade before it’s too late . . .
STELLA
Enough to keep you up half the night.
BLANCHE
Only someone as skilled as I am at being a woman can pick up these subtle signs.
STELLA
Enough to curb your appetite.
BLANCHE
I’m well trained, equipped. I know how to talk to him, to flirt with him, not get involved really, to decorate his arm, to aid him in his charade, to give him a passing grade.
STELLA
Sugar in a sixteen-ounce bottle.
BLANCHE
(grabbing Stella’s hand) I’m the real woman for you. I can show you satisfaction. A rewarding, cultural life; me and you, you and me, Blanche and Stella, Stella and Blanche ... You were such a pretty girl. (Stella pulls away) What day was it that you changed? You were tipped for the top and you threw it all away. You were headed upward to the good, right life and suddenly you changed.
STELLA
Pure sugar, liquid sex.
BLANCHE
Stella, you haven’t been listening to a word I’ve been saying.
STELLA
(Stanley has come through the audience and is standing facing Stella and Blanche) The fire is still burning . . . my clothes sticking to my chest just like Mama’s dress against her naked belly. Now why did she stay at the sink so long . . . (She walks towards Stanley) and every day without underwear. (She jumps into Stanley’s arms)
STANLEY
Hey! (Stanley spins her around , then they walk offstage together)
BLANCHE
Trouble is, Marlon Brando does look gorgeous. And I know that if I met him at the time he was in that film I’d want to lick his armpits. I don’t suppose he’d be able to open himself up to that though . . . surrender himself. But he does have that big shapely mouth ... I guess I’m pretty taken with this actor in the film. But what if the film was life and I could just walk right into it? I don’t suppose he’d welcome me, probably give me a hard time. Just like
STANLEY
(pulling in the painted vaudeville curtain behind Blanche) Ha Ha.
BLANCHE
(with the music beginning again) Now, here it comes . . . the record . . . and there’s a dark burgundy curtain opening on the stage, and there we are, just me and Vivien . . .
STANLEY
HA HA. Did you hear what I said? HA HA HA. (He exits)
BLANCHE
(singing)
MITCH
I was sitting on my asteroid, way up in the sky
BLANCHE
( speaking ) Are you sure that you’re a fairy?
MITCH
( singing) My wand, alas, I left at home, you’ll have to come on spec
STANLEY
( singing in monotone) Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday . . . Blanche, happy birthday to you.
BLANCHE
What a lovely cake. How many candles are on it?
STELLA
Don’t you worry about that right now. Why don’t you tell us one of your funny stories.
BLANCHE
I don’t think Mr. Kowalski would be interested in any of my funny stories.
STANLEY
I’ve got a funny story, what about this
BLANCHE
In the version I heard it was two pollacks.
STANLEY
I am not a pollack. People from Poland are Poles. There is no such thing as a pollack. And in any case, for your information, I am one hundred percent American.
STELLA
Well, now that we’re all getting along so well, why don’t you blow out the candles, Blanche, and make a wish.
STANLEY
Be careful what you wish for.
STANLEY
Stella! Blanche! Mitch! It’s dark. I’m afraid.
STELLA
Let’s play a game. (She blindfolds him and spins him around)
STANLEY
This is not funny. Stella. Mitch. (The lights slowly fade up. Stanley is wandering around the stage blindfolded) Don’t panic ... I feel these original sins burning into me. I feel I’m never safe. There I am at four a.m. with giant monsters spelling out my life in large slimy letters above my body, just far enough above it to heat it up. To make my skin bead in sweat starting just under my hair, above my forehead, on the back of my neck, on my chest and the back of my knees. Don’t panic ... I was born this way. I didn’t learn it at theatre school. I was born butch. I’m so queer I don’t even have to talk about it. It speaks for itself, it’s not funny. Being butch isn’t funny . . . don’t panic . . . I fall to pieces in the night. I’m just thousands of parts of other people all mashed into one body. I am not an original person. I take all these pieces, snatch them off the floor before they get swept under the bed, and I manufacture myself. When I’m saying I fall to pieces, I’m saying Marlon Brando was not there for me. (Pianist starts playing softly) James Dean failed to come through, where was Susan Hayward when I needed her, and Rita Hayworth was nowhere to be found. I fall to pieces at the drop of a hat. Just pick the piece you want and when I pull myself back together again I’ll think of you. I’ll think of you and what you want me to be. (He sings all the verses to a song in the style of the Frank Sinatra hit “My Way, ” while crawling onto the table with the birthday cake and presents on it. As he gets to his knees on top of the table, one hand breaks through a box and comes out covered in blood, the other hand goes into the cake and then into a box filled with feathers. He sings the final stanza kneeling on the cake) WHERE THE FUCK IS EVERYBODY?! (Blackout. After a short pause the lights come up on Stella and Stanley) What time is it?
STELLA
It’s four a.m.
STANLEY
Help me make it through the night.
STELLA
Don’t I always?
MITCH
(talking with his mouth full throughout) I think it all started to go wrong when I wasn’t allowed to be a boy scout. There were more important things to be done. Vacuuming, clearing up at home, putting the garbage out. I used to get so angry putting out the garbage, I’d kick the shit out of the garbage cans in front. I thought about what I was missing. It gave me a repulsion for physical activity. Swimming was the only exception, and even then it took me a long time to learn, as I was afraid of deep water. Then one day I fell in love with a beautiful young man. He came like a messenger from another world bearing a message of simple physical desire. But it was already too late, for me everything about the body was bound up with pain and boredom. I even used to eat fast because I found it so boring. Soon the boy left. He knew better than to spend his life cooking dinners for someone with poor appetite. Then I was alone. I lived in a small room near a fly-over. I stopped going out except to go to the laundry and get groceries. At night I would lie awake on my bed, and imagine I could hear things. (The sound of a ukelele from offstage. He opens one of the gift boxes on the table and the sound comes again. He reaches into the box and pulls out a ukelele, then sings a song in the style of “The Man I Love,” by George and Ira Gershwin. As he sings, tap-dancing Chinese lanterns - the remaining members of the cast in lantern costumes - enter and begin dancing around him. During the song the lanterns begin running into each other and floundering around the stage. The audience begins to hear them mumbling from under their costumes)
BLANCHE
Oh, what are we doing? I can’t stand it! I want to be in a real play! (bright light pops on as Stella drops her lantern to the floor) With real scenery! White telephones, French windows, a beginning, a middle and an end! This is the most confusing show I’ve ever been in. What’s wrong with red plush? What’s wrong with a theme and a plot we can all follow? There isn’t even a fucking drinks trolley. Agatha Christie was right.
STELLA
Now we all talked about this, and we decided that realism works against us.
BLANCHE
Oh we did, did we?
STELLA
Yes we did!
BLANCHE
But I felt better before, I could cope. All I had to do was learn my lines and not trip over the furniture. It was all so clear.
STANLEY
I’ll be tired tomorrow, I’ll be tired all day.
STELLA
Don’t think about tomorrow. (They embrace and kiss as the lights fade to black. The lights come up upstage right on Mitch stuffing cake into his mouth)
STELLA
You want realism?
BLANCHE
What do you mean?
STELLA
You want realism, you can have it.
BLANCHE
You mean like in a real play?
STELLA
If that’s what you want.
BLANCHE
With Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh?
STELLA
You think you can play it?
BLANCHE
I have the shoulders.
STANLEY
I have the pajamas . . . okay, let’s go for it. (Mitch and Stella exit, striking the light bulb curtain. Stanley sweeps the table with his forearm knocking the cake and presents to the floor) I cleared my place, want me to clear yours? It’s just you and me now, Blanche.
BLANCHE
You mean we’re alone in here?
STANLEY
Unless you got someone in the bathroom. (He takes off his pajama top and pulls out a bottle of beer)
BLANCHE
Please don’t get undressed without pulling the curtain.
STANLEY
Oh, this is all I’m gonna undress right now. Feel like a shower? (He opens the beer and shakes it, then lets it squirt all over the stage, then pours some over his head before drinking it ) You want some?
BLANCHE
No thank you.
STANLEY
(moving towards her, menacingly) Sure I can’t make you reconsider?
BLANCHE
Keep away from me.
STANLEY
What’s the matter, don’t you trust me? Afraid I might touch you or something? You should be so lucky. Take a look at yourself in that worn-out party dress from a third-rate thrift store. What queen do you think you are?
BLANCHE
(trying to get past him) Oh God.
STANLEY
(blocking her exit) I got your number baby.
BLANCHE
Do we have to play this scene? STANLEY
STANLEY
You wanted realism.
BLANCHE
Just let me get by you.
STANLEY
Get by me? Sure, go ahead. BLANCHE
STANLEY
You got plenty of room, go ahead.
BLANCHE
Not with you there! I’ve got to get by somehow!
STANLEY
You can get by, there’s plenty of room. I won’t hurt you. I like you. We’re in this together, me and you. We’ve known that from the start. We’re the extremes, the stereotypes. We are as far as we can go. We have no choice, me and you. We’re tried it all, haven’t we? We’ve rejected ourselves, not trusted ourselves, mirrored ourselves, and we always come back to ourselves. We’re the warriors. We have an agreement . . . there’s plenty in this world for both of us. We don’t have to give each other up to anyone. You are my special angel.
BLANCHE
You wouldn’t talk this way if you were a real man.
STANLEY
No, if I was a real man I’d say, “Come to think of it, you wouldn’t be so bad to interfere with.”
BLANCHE
And if I were really Blanche I’d say, “Stay back . . . don’t come near me another step ... or I’ll ...”
STANLEY
You’ll what?
BLANCHE
Something’s gonna happen here. It will.
STANLEY
What are you trying to pull?
BLANCHE
(pulling off one of her stiletto-heeled shoes) I warn you . . . don’t!
STANLEY
Now what did you do that for?
BLANCHE
So I could twist this heel right in your face.
STANLEY
You’d do that, wouldn’t you?
BLANCHE
I would, and I will if you . . .
STANLEY
You want to play dirty? I can play dirty. (He grabs her arm ) Drop it. I said drop it! Drop the stiletto!
BLANCHE
You think I’m crazy or something?
STANLEY
If you want to be in this play you’ve got to drop the stiletto.
BLANCHE
If you want to be in this play you’ve got to make me!
STANLEY
If you want to play a woman, the woman in this play gets raped and goes crazy in the end.
BLANCHE
I don’t want to get raped and go crazy. I just wanted to wear a nice frock, and look at the shit they’ve given me!
STELLA
(entering with Mitch) Gimme that shoe! (Pianist starts “Pushover” as she grabs Stanley and sings to him )
STELLA
All the girls think you’re fine, they even call you Romeo, You’ve got ’em, yeah you’ve got ’em runnin’ to and fro, oh yes you have.
MITCH
So you told all the boys that were gonna take me out
MITCH AND STELLA
Your tempting lips, your wavy hair,
STELLA

STANLEY
I knew it all along. The person we’ve been referring to as your sister is an imposter.
STELLA
Incredible! There’s no flies on you Stanley.
STANLEY
What did you say?
STELLA
I said there’s no disguising you, Stanley. You’re one hundred percent.
STANLEY
I thought you said something else . . . something about flies.
STELLA
Well, come to think of it, there is something in that area I’ve been meaning to open up a little.
STANLEY
So, you figured it out.
STELLA
Yeah, I figured it out.
STANLEY
And in those shoes. Un-fuckin’-believable! You know what this means?
STELLA

We live in a house that attracts lightning, and every time it storms. May makes us come out and sit in the car. It’s because of the tires, she says they keep us from getting fried. One time she said she saw a ball of lightning roll into the house, roll around the top of the stove, the sink, the kitchen cabinet. Smelling hot, looking for somewhere to land. May said it was looking for us. So we got smart, we sat in the car. It’s not us though, it’s the house. The people who lived here before us, they sat in their car too.

(in the blackout) Someone sinister may be at work on the highways of North Florida. So far the trail is eight victims long, each signpost along the way a bullet-riddled body of a middle-aged white man. A Citrus County man, missing since June, might be victim number nine. Investigators are looking for two women seen driving the missing man’s car.
MAY
Guess what I did today.
JUNE
What? What did you do?
MAY
Guess.
JUNE
You quit your job at the hospital.

No.

Garden dirt.
MAY
That’s a good smell.
JUNE
It’s okay.
MAY
I killed a guy.
JUNE
In your dreams!
MAY
Stop it! (She climbs into the front seat)
JUNE
I like that expression.

I hate it! ( She accidentally sits on the gun , pulls it out , then hides it under the front console)
JUNE

Sometime, honey.

JUNE
How much longer?
MAY
You doubt me, don’t you.
JUNE
Only that you don’t dream. How much longer?
MAY
As long as it takes.
JUNE
What takes?
MAY
Storms are like fits; they take as long as they take.
JUNE
How long is that?
MAY
Storms can do anything. When they’ve had it up to here they can blow you away.
JUNE
Is it really that bad out there?
MAY
Nah, she’s just thinking about it.
JUNE
She’s dreaming about it.
MAY
You can want to kill somebody.
JUNE
You sure can.
MAY
You can look at somebody and get sick.
JUNE
You could just throw up!
MAY
You can murder someone in your thoughts, you can murder someone just because of who they are.
JUNE
In your . . . thoughts.
MAY
I’m a murderer.
JUNE
A murderer?
MAY
Murderer! Murderer!
JUNE
Answer me. If you know what’s good for you, you’ll come clean. Why’d you do it?
MAY
(in Bette Davis character) I didn’t do it!
JUNE
You said that before!
MAY
And I’ll say it again. I can keep it up as long as you can.
JUNE
Listen, sister, you’re gonna fry for this. It means the hot seat for you.
MAY
It does if you can pin it on me, and I don’t think you can.
JUNE
I think I can.
MAY
I didn’t really kill anybody.
JUNE
( disappointed) I thought maybe you did.
MAY
(as May) I thought about it. I don’t have an alibi. I can’t account for my time, for my time during the murder.
JUNE TURNS OFF THE FLASHLIGHT AND THEY GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS STATE JUNE
It’s not that much time.
MAY
Hours pass and you don’t get anything done.
JUNE
You pass the time.
MAY
Killing time.
JUNE
So little time.
JUNE
Once I dreamt that she was dying, . . . funny, the dream . .. although she was perfectly healthy, she was dying because death was . . . persistent . .. well organized, and persistent . . . she had, I don’t know ... a problem, like when a sleeper gets tangled up in the bedsheet . . . something tortuous that just waking up would have solved . . . but death was persistent, well organized and persistent . . . she was naked, on her back, pelvis tilted upward, and death was leaning over her, wooing her . . . she protested . . . the tilted pelvis showed resistance . .. she always resisted with that part of herself ... I dreamt she died that way.
I NEVER TOLD HER THOUGH
mine are white and clean, I’ve been dreaming.
MAY
I’ll tell you the whole truth, just not right now. Later maybe in an hour, or a week or a year, just not right now. (She assumes the “interrogation position ” sitting in the back window of the car) Yeah I knew him. I knew him but not well. We had fun. I showed him the time of his life, such as it was. But he’s gone now and don’t you think that is better? You don’t? Are you going to take his side? Oh good, good, take his side. Take his whole body, nobody else wanted it I’m afraid. Not now anyway. Maybe later. I’m doing my best, you know that. (Thunder and lightning; June turns off the flashlight and turns around; May slides back down into the back seat)
JUNE
Here comes the rain.
MAY
Yeah, you can smell it.
JUNE
All this rain is good for stuff.
MAY
What stuff?
JUNE
Plants.
MAY
You better shut that window.

I saw this picture in a magazine. A man took pictures of a river at night where crocodiles swim, some river or other in some country or other and it was just black with brilliant sparklings in it like diamonds, and those diamonds were the crocodiles’ eyes reflecting light. And it said they do that in wars, they take night pictures to see enemy eyes.

MAY
Make it a sloe gin fizz.

The women are not being called suspects and the slayings are not officially termed serial killings. However, the similarities are so striking that investigators feel compelled to warn the public, particularly middle-aged white men travelling alone. There’s a possibility one or more persons are out there targeting these individuals.
MAY

MAY
By what?
JUNE
When you said, “Take a lover.”
MAY
Oh - if you’re not satisfied with me, find someone else to love.
JUNE
But I love you.
MAY
I know. We’ve been together a long time. Maybe our relationship needs a little spicing up.
JUNE
Oh, you mean splitting up.

No, it doesn’t mean we have to split up. We could just give each other the freedom to have an affair.

That was a joke. I feel perfectly fine except I think I’ll throw up. And then I’ll take all your favorite photographs and cut them in a million pieces and flush them down the toilet. I’ll throw money at you in a public place! And then I’ll lock your cats out all night long and hope they get lost, and then I’ll mix up your seed packets so the wrong thing grows in the wrong place, and then I’ll take your snow-globe collection and throw it in the garbage in another county!

Unh hunh. You meet the most interesting people on the Interstate. Unh hunh. I love the Interstate. It leads to all parts of the body of the world! When I’m on the highway I feel like iron in someone’s blood.

Police were told by a convenience store manager on Wednesday morning about two suspicious women staying at the Gater Lodge Hotel. They’ve been staying at the twenty-five dollar-a-night motel in a run-down part of the city since Friday. The women, one blonde and the other brunette, match the description somewhat of composite sketches of the women being sought. Police say if the women turned out to be responsible, it would be something malignantly new under the Florida sun.
MAY CRAWLS INTO THE BACK SEAT

I grew up in Augusta, and I went from Augusta to May. Augusta to May, like a summer going backwards. I was up in Tallahassee where spring comes in January and leaves quick in February as if the cops just came looking for it. I had come down to buy a car. There was this cousin of mine selling a car. I went and looked at the car, agreed to buy it. That night, to celebrate, I took myself to a little tavern near the motel, right on the highway. Bourbon and Coke was on its way from the table to my lips when May walked in. It’s trite, meeting someone for the first time in a bar. But this wasn’t like that. I stood up. When she walked in, I stood up. Like I had been expecting her. She stood in the doorway for a moment, then walked over to me, laughed and said, “So let’s see it.” It was a bizarre thing to say. It was a painted-up, bold thing to say. And I had no idea what she meant by it. God, she was beautiful, and her fingernails were dirty. Her hands were sexy like sex itself, they were sticky and young, they seemed to tell a story, and I could tell I was staring at them, I wanted to put her hand in my mouth, and she said it again! “So let’s see it.” So I took her to see my car. I hadn’t paid for it yet. She got in it, backed it up, revved it up to sixty, and crashed it into the cement wall at the end of the street, it was a dead end. A fake dead end. Right beyond that wall was another street. I don’t understand Tallahassee. We bought another car and moved here.
JUNE
Just the two of us in the rain.
MAY
Yeah, so?
JUNE
Like a million years ago in the floods in the ark. Nothing but rain and two of every kind. . . . Two cows . . .
MAY
Yeah, I went to church. I went to Bible class every Thursday. Not Sunday. Thursday. They said Sunday was a day of rest, but I slept through class so it would have been fine. Fine on Sunday, but they had it Thursday. I used to sleep while the teacher read out loud from the Bible. I’d sleep with my eyes open ... it was like dozing in front of the eleven o’clock news . . . names and places . . . violent deaths, stories that were supposed to hit close to home. Every once in a while I remember something from the Bible ... a name just comes up out of the mist . . . like Jehosaphat or Moab. Or something. I think of lightning and no electricity. I like the Bible because it’s about people living in the country. Violent know-it-alls, living in the country. It’s the wild stuff I like . . . sex in caves among family members to keep the race from dying out. Violent rainstorms without end. Kings. Secrets. The way nothing ever made any sense. Even though the Bible is supposedly about law and order, there never was any. Just people screwing and sweating and killing in the country or up on a mountain carrying stones and talking to people who weren’t there.
JUNE
Wait, wait.
MAY
Let me go, let me goooo!
JUNE
Go ahead . . . wait, no, easy now, will you? You don’t know what you’re doing!
MAY
I know what I’m doing!
JUNE
Believe me, you don’t know what you’re doing!
MAY
What do you know, what do you know about my life? I’m a fed-up tortured soul, but does the world care? It just lays there. Listen, listen, listen to it, it’s ignoring me (she tries to shoot). The world is ignoring me . . .
JUNE
No, no, no, no, let’s work this out, huh? Let’s not do anything hasty, huh? Think back, when did this all begin?
MAY
When I was born . ..
JUNE
Let’s not go back that far! When did the real trouble begin?
MAY
I was born in a little town outside of Chicago . . . Miami! It was beautiful, the blue sea stretching as far as the eye can see. White-capped waves waving. It was beautiful. I grew up there. I grew up believing I could do anything. Be anything, I could be president, and my father sent me to nursing school.
JUNE
You must have been very happy!
MAY
I was miserable!
JUNE
Of course you were!
MAY
But then I went to work in the county hospital, with all the doctors and nurses rushing back and forth, back and forth, and the elevators going up and down, up and down. Everything going around and around. It was incredible.
JUNE
You were miserable!
MAY
I loved it!
JUNE
Of course you did!
MAY
I’d wake up every morning with a smile on my lips and a chuckle in my heart. Hahahahahahah. Don’t laugh! (She points the gun at June)
JUNE
Don’t laugh! All right! No!
MAY
I was a fool, floating on the flotsam and jetsam of the night shift .. .
JUNE
You were overworked.
MAY
You could see me washed up on the shore of an underpaid job . . .
JUNE
You were a bum.
MAY
I had no life, just work all night and too tired to do anything else. Coming home in the cold mornings, wind and rain blowing around me . . . feet aching . .. (She starts to cry).
PLATE
Don't Laugh! Photo
JUNE
Boohoohoo.
MAY
(pointing the gun again) Don’t cry!
JUNE
Don’t cry!
MAY
It was then that fortune smiled on me . . .
JUNE
Well, it’s about time!
MAY
I got a job with a prominent specialist, Dr. Thomas. I worked days, I was in charge. Can’t you visualize it? Picture it. Just picture it (she sings) the perfect job in a private practice tralala tralala.
JUNE
Tralala tralala.
MAY
(with the gun in June's face) Don’t sing.
JUNE
Don’t sing, no!
MAY
That was Dr. Thomas’ song. Dr. Thomas was a spoiled son of a . . . plastic surgeon. But he showered me with things. He showered me with fringe benefits
JUNE
He changed.
JUNE
(recovering) You really can talk!
JUNE
Let’s talk. Let’s look on the bright side. Wasn’t there a bright side?
MAY
Well, there was. The next day he came crawling back to me on his hands and knees begging my forgiveness, he didn’t mean it.
JUNE
You misunderstood.
MAY
I made it up . . . then he showered me with things ... a four-day week, an hour for lunch, a raise in salary . ..
JUNE
Yes.
MAY
But then he changed . . .
JUNE
He changed (she’s aware of what’s coming).
MAY
He followed me into the ladies’ room. I could hear his footsteps coming up behind me. I turned around and there he was. I
JUNE
(climbing into the front seat) You sure can talk. Good riddance to the bum.
MAY
What do you mean calling Dr. Thomas a bum? He was no bum. He was a gentleman. He showered me with things. The newest equipment, computers, electronic thermometers, receptionists, secretaries. He made me nurse of the month. And then he changed . . . he followed me into the ladies’ room. I could hear his steps coming up behind me and there he was. I couldn’t stand it anymore. I said “Take that and that and that” . . . (May goes wild , beating up June and following her into the back seat).
JUNE
(trying to recover) I guess you really told him, huh?
MAY
I feel a lot better.
JUNE
Well you got a lot out.
MAY
I feel a whole lot better.

You came when I was young Too young to know That there’s nothing there in the dark That’s not in the light That’s what scares me Boogie man

Once we picked wild raspberries together by the railroad tracks. At night. Ridiculous. She said she knew where they grew, and I loved to make preserves. She said we couldn’t go during the day, it was forbidden. Against the law! Of course we went at night . . . raspberries . . . little clusters of edible garnets . . . the darker, the sweeter . . . when they’re at their prettiest, they’re too young to eat . . . and the raspberry bramble is so protective of her bower . .. thorns ... we brought metal pots ... it was dark, and there was that odd, hot wind, and we crouched down where the trains passed, we were eye level with the train wheels, like being in the mouth of an animal. She forbade me to cry out when the thorns burned my skin, and in the dark I crushed more berries than I picked ... it was torture, not knowing when the pain was going to come, and trying not to scream when it did, and trains kept coming. By morning my fingers were blue with berries and blue with blood and my lips were blue with cold and the horizon was purple as if we’d crushed all those berries against the sky. All those raspberries hidden somewhere in the sunrise . . . she washed my hands for me . . . sucked the bruises . . . even that reads like a dream to me, but she says she never dreams. And I believe her.

Ocala police said today that they had arrested a woman believed to be the killer who in the last year had slain as many as seven middle-aged white male motorists whose bodies were found alongside highways of North and Central Florida. The woman is being held without bail. Police said they had not determined her motives, but investigators who interviewed relatives and acquaintances of the woman did say that her relationships with men in her younger years were not the best. (The lights come up on May and June in the front seat with a white sheet covering their bodies up to their necks) The commissioner of Florida Department of Law Enforcement said he trusts that the arrest will be a relief to people in the area and that residents could now rest easy.

JUNE
Buenos noches Madrid. It has taken me a long time to get here this night. But now I am here. This time my lover is in jail. It does not matter what she has done. My heart is always with her. And with your permission I will dedicate this song to her.
JUNE
One night ... there was just this one night ... one night ... it was ... I don’t even know when it was ... a little time ago, not a long time ... I looked over at her and I just wasn’t sure anymore ... we don’t smoke . . . we don’t usually smoke, but that night we were smoking ... we were smoking feminine cigarettes, I forget the name . . . they’re long and skinny like tampons . . . Maurice or Vavoom or something like that, with a V ... we had the radio on, and a little inlet of that nameless river was opening out in front of us .. . she tried to put her cigarette out, but it skipped away from her in a little fit of wind . . . you know, when you smoke a cigarette in winter, the wind smokes it with you ... it burns down so fast you don’t even know if you really smoked it or not . . . and one of the sparks from the end just held the ground and died out real slow ... it looked like a planet very far away in the night sky, dying out like a tiny point against the asphalt . . . and we both watched it . . . stared at it ... couldn’t stop. And when it finally went out, we were afraid to look at each other .. . both of us just staring at the point where the spark had been . . . afraid to meet eyes ... I knew when I looked at her I was going to see something ... something I had been . . . saying no to . . . something she knew, and I knew, but we didn’t know together . . . and that’s like not knowing at all. ... So finally after a real long time, her forehead and my forehead sort of lifted up . . . and when I looked at her ... her eyes .. . everything I knew about her and about our daily life ... I wasn’t sure about it anymore . . . wasn’t sure if it was true ... like I had made it up ... or read about it a long time ago and forgotten what I read . . . and nothing was on between us except the radio . . . and this story about a prostitute from Okala, Florida and death . . . and I wanted to slip into that story and I think she did too ... it felt like we were twin murderers with amnesia ... innocent only because we forgot ...
MAY
Then what?
JUNE
Stop.
MAY
Come on ... what would happen then}

Wash up! What for?
MAY
We kiss . .. we kiss several times.
JUNE
We kiss for courage!
MAY
Right!
JUNE
We don’t even feel like kissing . . . we’re too scared to kiss! We kiss for courage!
MAY
You’re absolutely right!
JUNE
We kiss for memory. We kiss before we fall into history.
MAY
We want to be remembered.
JUNE
We kiss to be remembered . . . They’ll remember us . . . they’ll talk about us . . . we’re falling into history . . .

No! You’re wrong! They’re looking forward to things! They pay like dreamers!
JUNE
Bullshit.
MAY
Okay! They pay like sleepwalkers!

We come back out.
MAY
Giggling . . . the men are smiling at us . ..
JUNE
We get back in the truck . . .
MAY
You think it’s a truck?
JUNE
Four-wheel drive.
MAY
Pickup . . . big horsepower.
JUNE
Imagine, measuring things in terms of what they used to be! Horsepower! 250 horsepower! As if a car or truck could be likened to 250 lean, beautiful horses! That would be 1,000 flanks of legs gleaming in moonlight galloping someplace . . .
MAY
Where?
JUNE
What?
MAY
Where next?
JUNE
In the truck . . .
MAY
Then what?
JUNE
That’s like imagining people in terms of apes! To say a person, like a really smart person, has 250 ape-power!
MAY
So we’re back in the truck . . .
JUNE
You kiss one, I kiss the other . . . MAY
JUNE
You’re right ... I’m in the front seat, kissing this ... ape ... and my eyes are open as bulletholes looking right at you.
MAY
I love when you look at me.
JUNE
I’m hungry . . .
MAY
Let’s keep going.
JUNE
I’m not interested! I want something to eat!
MAY
Let’s go to my garden and pick tomatoes.
JUNE
At this hour?
MAY
What’s wrong?
JUNE
It’s broad daylight . . .
MAY
So?

The garden in daylight is the closest you come to a dream. MAY
JUNE
I don’t believe you.
MAY
What don’t you believe?
JUNE
I don’t believe you don’t dream.
MAY
I don’t believe you do.
JUNE
And then we kill them . . .
MAY
We abandon them . . .
JUNE
The bodies . . . that’s all they were.
MAY
Bodies.
JUNE
Bodies hunting bodies.
MAY
We relieved them by killing them. It was a relief.
JUNE
(holding the guns in her hands) What were you thinking? MAY
JUNE
Were you dreaming?
MAY
No! I was thinking.
JUNE
What about?
MAY
Math.
JUNE
What?
MAY
Mathematics.
JUNE
What about them?
MAY
About ... if you divide a number by zero.
JUNE
What then?
MAY
If you divide a number by zero it’s like putting a white sheet over the number.
JUNE
Like it’s dead?
MAY
Yeah . . . like it died in the hospital . . .
JUNE
After an operation?
MAY
Yes . . . after an operation . . .
JUNE
By a fat surgeon?
MAY
Yes ... a round, middle-aged man with white skin . . .
JUNE
Soft white skin when you shake his hand, vulgar soft . . . MAY
JUNE
Rich bastard . . .
MAY
And other things . . .
JUNE
Tell me.
MAY
There’s a number for everything . . .
JUNE
A phone number.
MAY
No ... a number ... a number of times . . .
JUNE
Of times?
MAY
Yes ... a number of times ... a number of times . . . that we’ll do things and say things . . . let’s say .. . how many times we’ll kiss . . .
JUNE
How many times we’ll fight . . .
MAY
How many times it’ll rain . . .
JUNE
How many times we’ll say how many times.
MAY
Before we . . .
JUNE
. . . die.
MAY
In Bible class they said the very hairs on your head are numbered.
JUNE
Can I count your hairs?
MAY
No.
JUNE
Why not?
MAY
It would take too long.
JUNE
Please?
MAY
We have no time.
JUNE
We have time.
MAY
No.
JUNE
We have . . .
MAY
No . . . but you can divide me by zero . . .
JUNE
Can I?
MAY
Yes ... cover me in white . . .
JUNE
Can I cover you in white?
MAY
Yes, please . . .
JUNE
And lay you to rest?
MAY
Yes, please . . .
JUNE
Is there a number how many times I can do that?
MAY
Yes ... but I don’t know . . .
JUNE
You don’t know?
MAY
No ... I don’t know.
JUNE
(to audience) I’d love to watch her really kill somebody. Kill somebody by the railroad tracks in the wind while the trains went by, somebody with a beard of thorns and a crotch as hard and bitter as an unripe raspberry. Y’all know anybody like that?

Oh no sir, not at all.

PEGGY
It’s about a famous film star - in the fifties - she has to flee to Europe.
LOIS
How exciting!

She’s been summoned to testify. McCarthyism, witchhunts, you know. So she fakes her own suicide.

He does everything for me, he even dresses me. I like it. Why should I worry about it if we’re complicit in it? (Lois enters with a tray and serves tea) I like him taking care of me and he likes to do it. We appear perfectly normal. He’s just one step ahead of me. I love him and if it makes him happy, I’m happy. We’ve talked about change, but it’s just at the talking stage. We try and grow together. That’s why it’s lasted so long. But it’s hard to change. Sometimes he ‘lets me’ get dressed by myself, but it makes him irritable and he criticises me and picks at me all day. But I do it anyway. (She starts to exit)

That’ll be your publisher.
LOIS
Don’t worry. They’ll ring back. Have some cake.
PEGGY
I’m not hungry.
LOIS
You don’t have to be hungry to eat cake. Here (she offers some on a fork), try. I baked it myself. (She feeds her)
PEGGY
Mmmmm that’s wonderful. What a good idea.
LOIS
I knew you’d like it. (She continues to stuff Peggy’s mouth with cake)
PEGGY
I am a writer aren’t I?
LOIS
Of course you are ... At least you can put that in your passport ... You should keep a diary. Publishers are always interested in personal recollections.
PEGGY
Won’t that take a long time?
LOIS
Oh - about a lifetime.
PEGGY
(with her mouth full of cake) Take my shoe off. Go on take it off. Massage my foot.

I, er, don’t really think . ..
PEGGY
What’s the problem
LOIS
I am, sir.
PEGGY
Then be servile.
LOIS
I think you’ll find it’s a bit more subtle than that.
PEGGY
Sir!
LOIS
Sir!
LOIS
(breaking out of character) I’m not happy with this game. Let’s try another one. (She exits around the stage left screens with the tea tray) I’ll describe it to you. You can write it down and then we can send it out with the shirts to be laundered (she appears in the doorway briefly then peers over the screens on stage right) and I’ll come back all stiff and clean and you’ll love me then won’t you?
PEGGY
I need a more comfortable chair.
LOIS
(disappearing behind the screens) I should plunder the past. I might turn up something useful. I could inspire myself rather than everyone else. (She enters through the doorway and returns to character) Have you considered redecorating, sir?
PEGGY
Brown, plain, masculine.
LOIS
And the bedroom, sir? (She rolls the chaise longue to stage right with Peggy on it)
PEGGY
The same. Functional. Nothing too fussy. Comfortable of course.
LOIS
Of course.
PEGGY
Maybe a few cushions.
LOIS
Carpet? (She exits)
PEGGY
Rugs.
LOIS
I would recommend wall to wall, sir. To keep out the draughts. (She enters with a blanket and covers Peggy)
PEGGY
Perhaps.
LOIS
And curtains. (She exits)
PEGGY
Oh yes, curtains. At every window. Closed.
LOIS
All day, sir? (She returns with cushions)
PEGGY
It’s the light. ... I suffer from migraine.
LOIS
I see, sir.
PEGGY
You do?
LOIS
Oh yes, sir. There’s a small room in the attic, sir. Perfect for a maid. (She exits)
PEGGY
A woman?
LOIS
(from offstage) They usually are sir.
PEGGY
Is that strictly necessary?
LOIS
If sir wishes to host functions. (She enters with a glass of beer on a silver tray)
PEGGY
Functions?
LOIS
Do’s, sir. Social events.
PEGGY
Perhaps. One day. When I’m more ...
LOIS
Established?
PEGGY
Comfortable.

In yourself, sir?
PEGGY
In the house, Barratt. In the house.
LOIS
Your drink, sir.
PEGGY
What?
LOIS
Your beer, sir.
PEGGY
Oh . . . good.
LOIS
( noticing the purple gown on the screen) I’m sorry, sir. I didn’t realize. You have company.
PEGGY
Company?
LOIS
A guest, sir. A female guest.
PEGGY
A woman! Where?
LOIS
Here, sir.
PEGGY
There is no woman here. No woman in this house. Just me . . . and now you it seems.
LOIS
As you wish, sir. In that case may I draw your attention to the article of clothing to your left.
PEGGY
A-a-ah-h! (She covers her head with the blanket)
LOIS
I think I’m correct in assuming it’s a gown.
PEGGY
Don’t touch it!
LOIS
Yes. I was right. It is a gown. Shall I remove it, sir?
PEGGY
Burn it!
LOIS
That seems very drastic, if I may say, sir.
PEGGY
Just get rid of it.
LOIS
In that case, sir, I’ll fetch the paraffin. (She breaks out of character and taunts Peggy with the dress) You’ve got a guilty secret and I’m not gonna try and drag it out of you. I’m not gonna pry because I’m safer not knowing it and you’re safer not saying it. (She exists to behind the scrim in the stage right screen. The following scene takes place behind the screens)
PEGGY
(breaking out of character and exiting to behind the scrim in the stage left screen) I didn’t know we were so concerned with safety.
LOIS
What’s with the we all of a sudden. What do you mean we? Why are you using this word from the past, from the innocent past, when it was just you and me. There was a time, I was the only one. Now I’m the sad and lonely one.
PEGGY
That’s so low using song lyrics. So low.
LOIS
Now when you say we it could mean anyone. You and them. Not necessarily me is included in the we, if you catch my meaning.
PEGGY
Isn’t this what we wanted? You’re asking for it, you’re really asking for it.
LOIS
It’s only the secret I’m asking for, despite my reluctance to do so.
PEGGY
I’m not going to tell you.
LOIS
I don’t want to know. (The lights go out behind the scrim)
PEGGY
( entering through the doorway in character) I’d like some . . .
LOIS
(following) Toast?
PEGGY
Ah yes and . . .
LOIS
Eggs - bacon?
PEGGY
Did you . . .
LOIS
Freshly ground, as requested.
PEGGY
And the . . .
LOIS
Times.
PEGGY
I’d like some . . .
LOIS
Toast?
PEGGY
Ah yes and . . .
LOIS
Eggs - bacon?
PEGGY
Did you . . .
LOIS
Freshly ground, as requested.
PEGGY
And the . . .
LOIS
Times.
PEGGY
I’d like some . . .
LOIS
Toast?
PEGGY
Ah yes and . . .
LOIS
Eggs - bacon?
PEGGY
Did you . . .
LOIS
Freshly ground, as requested.
PEGGY
And the . . .
LOIS
Times , sir.
PEGGY
What’s this?
LOIS
(placing a telephone on the pedestal ) A telephone, sir.
PEGGY
I never ordered one.
LOIS
I thought it best, sir, should there be an urgent need for it. PEGGY
LOIS
An accident . . .
PEGGY
But there won’t be any accidents will there, Barratt? That’s why you’re here. You’re a precaution I’ve taken. Isn’t that so?
LOIS
I might not always be here, sir.
PEGGY
What do you mean by that? You’re not going to leave me are you? I couldn’t bear it if you left me. You told me you’d be here for ever.
LOIS
I won’t leave you.
PEGGY
I don’t care what you do. Just don’t leave me.
LOIS
I won’t leave you.
PEGGY
I love you. I’ve always loved you. Since the day I was born. LOIS
PEGGY
Why should you leave? You’re comfortable, aren’t you? Well paid. A fully equipped kitchen. A large garden.
LOIS
I have an elderly mother, sir.
PEGGY
But what would I do?
LOIS
I’d make sure you were well looked after.
PEGGY
It’s got very dark.
LOIS
Time to shut the curtains. Oh what shall I do, sir?
PEGGY
Barratt?
LOIS
About the phone, sir.
PEGGY
I suppose it can stay.
LOIS
Very good, sir.
LOIS
( on the phone) Yes . .. Yes 4 . . . everything’s perfect. (She hangs up the phone) Just the telephone company, sir. Testing the line.
PEGGY
( typing) Barratt
LOIS
(entering) Oh, excuse me, sir. I’m sorry to disturb you.
PEGGY
I’m on the typewriter.
LOIS
Yes I realize that, sir.
PEGGY
It’s a crucial moment.
LOIS
Yes I’m sorry, sir. It’s just that . . .
PEGGY
Could we finish this later?
LOIS
Of course, sir. I’m very sorry, sir. It won’t happen again. (She exits)
PEGGY
Damn!
LOIS
(from behind the scrim in the stage right screen) The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain. The rain in Spain . . .
PEGGY
What are you doing?
LOIS
Practising.
PEGGY
Barratt .. . ( Lois enters unseen and stands behind Peggy) Barratt . . . Bar . . .
LOIS
Yes, sir?
PEGGY
What’s that terrible noise?
LOIS
It’s the men, sir.
PEGGY
What men?
LOIS
the workmen in the cellar, sir. There’s some trouble with the foundations. (She moves Peggy on the chaise longue to downstage center)
PEGGY
Will it go on long?
LOIS
Quite some time, sir. It’s a big job, considering the state of the house when you arrived.
PEGGY
I hope I’ve done the right thing in coming here.
LOIS
Of course, sir. It looks perfectly acceptable from the outside. PEGGY
LOIS
They came recommended. But I’m keeping an eye on them. (She manipulates Peggy's body into a stereotypical masculine pose) Watching their every move, studying them carefully. Then I can report back to you, sir. Every detail.
PEGGY
Is that strictly necessary?
LOIS
Oh yes, sir. (She slaps her on the back , forcing her to sit up straight) We wouldn’t want the house falling down, now would we?
PEGGY
You might bring me a beer.
LOIS
I was just about to, sir.
PEGGY
And Barratt!
LOIS
Yes, sir?
PEGGY
I don’t want to be disturbed.
LOIS
Very well, sir. (She takes the phone off the hook and walks upstage to the doorway and puts on a bloody butcher's apron) I’ll stand behind the screens and wait. I have all the props and costumes I need to pull this off. (She exits)
PEGGY
(standing on the downstage end of the chaise lounge) I don’t cry anymore. I used to cry when I was a girl. Now I don’t cry. It feels great. I get mad a lot now. I get so mad that the only way to feel right is to be aggressive. I can’t help it. Then I apologize, and that feels good. I can’t help it. It feels right. I feel good. I don’t
LOIS
(entering) What are you doing?
PEGGY
Eating fruit.
LOIS
Which kind?
PEGGY
Oranges.
LOIS
Are you sure?
PEGGY
What do you mean, am I sure?
LOIS
Are you sure they’re oranges?
PEGGY
They look like oranges, taste like oranges, smell like oranges. LOIS
PEGGY
Who mentioned grapes?
LOIS
I did. I mentioned grapes.
PEGGY
Why change the subject, we were talking about oranges. LOIS
PEGGY
What skins?
LOIS
The orange skins?
PEGGY
Oh, you mean the peel?
LOIS
Yes, the peel. Where is it?
PEGGY
I ate it.
LOIS
You ate it?
PEGGY
All of it. It’s good for the skin.
LOIS
I know what it’s good for. That’s not the point. You don’t eat grapes ’til the end. Then you gorge yourself.
PEGGY
I’m gorging now.
LOIS
Ha!
PEGGY
Ha?
LOIS
(Bringing her hands from behind her back to reveal knives and forks between her fingers like giant silver claws) I knew you wouldn’t be able to restrain yourself. I knew!
PEGGY
It didn’t take a genius to work that one out.
LOIS
I make no claims for genius. Call it intuition.
PEGGY
Female intuition?
LOIS
I wouldn’t know anything about that, sir.
PEGGY
Then get back to the kitchen.
LOIS
You’ll give yourself away, sir, and I won’t be able to mend it. (She lays Peggy out on the couch like meat on a slab and displays each body part with the knives and forks ) See these arms? These arms aren’t that big, they’re not that developed, can’t lift a lot of weights, but men don’t screw with their arms. See these legs? They’re not especially sporty legs, they’re a little flabby and they can’t run that far, but men don’t screw with their legs. See these hands, they’re not that great. I mean, they can do some damage and have, but it doesn’t matter because men don’t screw with their hands. The back
PLATE
I knew you wouldn't be able to restrain yourself Photo
PEGGY
I haven’t left the couch for three days. Or is it four?
LOIS
It’s been a week. (She moves Peggy on the chaise longue to stage left)
PEGGY
A week! How time flies!
LOIS
How’s the screenplay coming along, sir? (She exits)
PEGGY
It’s dried up. I’ve no ideas left. (Lois enters with a blanket and tucks her in) Thank you. Maybe I’ll go upstairs.
LOIS
What for?
PEGGY
Don’t know. Something to do. I can’t really remember what it looks like.
LOIS
Big. Dark. Cold.
PEGGY
Oh, that’s right.
LOIS
Damp. Echoey. Gloomy.
PEGGY
That’s enough . . . Talk to me. Amuse me.
LOIS
It’s not in my job description.
PEGGY
Anything. Tell me anything. What’s happening downstairs?
LOIS
I found the cat eating a kitten but apart from that, nothing new. Just the same old routine . . . I’ll get you another blanket. (She exits and returns immediately with a blanket) You look cold.
PEGGY
No. I’m fine.
LOIS
Take it. There, that’s better. You look ill.
PEGGY
I do feel tired.
LOIS
Overdoing it. Stress. What you need is a nice cup of tea. I’ll get us one in a minute. Just let me rearrange these pillows.
PEGGY
No really.
LOIS
Keep still. There. Comfy? Oh dear, there’s a smudge on your nose. How funny you look. (She gets out a handkerchief) Lick it. Go on. Now keep still.
PEGGY
Ow!
LOIS
Don’t be such a baby.
PEGGY
It hurts.
LOIS
Do you want me to kiss it better?
PEGGY
Is that proper?
LOIS
We make our own rules, don’t we sir?
PEGGY
I suppose so. I don’t know. I can’t think. I’m too tired. LOIS
PEGGY
I don’t want any tea.
LOIS
Yes you do. You like tea.
PEGGY
It’s all we do. Drink tea.
LOIS
It’s good for you, refreshing, calming.
PEGGY
I don’t like it.
LOIS
Yes you do. You do like it. You love it. You drink it with milk and one sugar.
PEGGY
No I don’t.
LOIS
You like it with lemon.
PEGGY
I don’t.
LOIS
You like it black.
PEGGY
No, I . . .
LOIS
You drink Assam and Darjeeling and Ceylon.
PEGGY
Stop it.
LOIS
And Lapsang Souchong and Earl Grey and especially English Breakfast.
PEGGY
No.
LOIS
You like it iced in summer and in November you drink it with milk and honey.
PEGGY
No.
LOIS
And when you get ill, you drink it with whiskey. (She loses control ) Yes, you do. You, do, you do, you do. Don’t ever tell me you don’t like tea again. (Out of character ) I like this game.
PEGGY
Sure you do, you love this game.
LOIS
But what happens now?
PEGGY
What do you mean?
LOIS
So the movie star moves to London and she takes a manservant and then he lives with the drapes pulled and the phone off the hook.
PEGGY
Off the hook?
LOIS
So we won’t be disturbed, sir.
PEGGY
Wise, Barratt.
LOIS
Thank you sir, not at all. But, then what? (She pushes the typewriter toward Peggy with her foot)
PEGGY
I don’t know what you’re getting at.
LOIS
Don’t you think we could use a maid sir?
PEGGY
A what?
LOIS
A maid, sir, a housekeeper, a woman about the house, some one to pick up . . . (she hands her the typewriter) you know . . .
PEGGY
This isn’t helping.
LOIS
What isn’t?
PEGGY
This isn’t. It’s supposed to be firing me up. Instead I’m exhausted, I can’t do anything.
LOIS
Go back and sit down. I’ll bring you some tea.
PEGGY
Who will?
LOIS
I will.
PEGGY
Do I know you? Have we met?
LOIS
Tea - and cake.
PEGGY
I want coffee. Make it strong. Put three heaping spoonfuls of espresso in the Melita or it’s useless to me. I like my coffee strong. Forte. It’s gotta give me a slug of energy. Make mine strong. Make mine. Make mine a double espresso.
LOIS
Coffee will make you nervous.
PEGGY
I do have a headache.
LOIS
I’ll bring you an aspirin.
PEGGY
I think I’ll lie down.
LOIS
It’s probably best . . . sir. (She places the phone back on the hook. It rings immediately. Lois watches it as it rings then picks the receiver up and places it back down , cutting off the connection. Sound of wind)
IT MUST BE JANUARY

PEGGY
(lethargically pecking on the typewriter) I’m working.
LOIS
I’m helping. Shall I adjust your chair?
PEGGY
No thanks.
LOIS
Do you need any more paper?
PEGGY
No thanks, I’m fine.
LOIS
What about a ribbon for your typewriter?
PEGGY
No problem.
LOIS
Need any new ideas?
PEGGY
I’m still trying to capture the sense of power you get when you’re loved so completely and utterly that your every need is not only . . .
LOIS
. . . met . . .
PEGGY
. . . but . . .
LOIS
. . . anticipated.
PEGGY
Right.
LOIS
Would you mind if I came a bit closer, sir?
PEGGY
Go on.
LOIS
How about here, sir?
PEGGY
That’s fine.
LOIS
You wouldn’t mind if I just sat right here, would you? PEGGY
LOIS
I’ll just sit right here. (She traps Peggy with her arms and leans into her face) So I’m sitting in January thinking about April. April in Paris, New York in June, October in Berlin. . .
PEGGY
Berlin?
LOIS
Berlin!
PEGGY
What the hell are you getting at?
LOIS
Nothing you need concern yourself with, sir. You look sleepy. Why don’t you have a nap?
PEGGY
You’re right, I can barely keep my eyes open. But I can’t sleep. There’s too much work to be done on the screenplay.
LOIS
Leave it to me, sir. (She pushes her back into a reclining position) Just leave it to me. (She walks to the telephone and picks up the receiver) Hello is anyone there? Anyone out there? Am I talking to anybody? Can anyone hear me? Anyone on the line
PEGGY
Barratt?
LOIS
(appearing through the stage right scrim as she dresses in a maid's uniform) Your job is to fall in love with me.
PEGGY
I already fell in love with you in Italy.
LOIS
It was Berlin.
PEGGY
Berlin?
LOIS
(in a fake German accent) Don’t you remember? How could you forget so easily?
PEGGY
Karin? .. . Oooh, Karin. (She stands up) We haven’t played
PLATE
I'll have to detach myself, like an appliance with detachable parts. Lois
LOIS
(peering over the edge of the screen as she dresses) Slow down. First you have to woo me.
PEGGY
Woo you? I hardly know you?
LOIS
Yes, you know, seduce me with poetry, win me over with tokens of your love.
PEGGY
Can’t we just fuck?
LOIS
Later. First you have to get me in the mood.
PEGGY
I could sing to you but I’d need a band.
LOIS
I think I hear music.
LOIS
(interrupting the song) No, no, no, no, no!!
PEGGY
I’m sorry?
LOIS
You’re supposed to be singing to me; to me. The love object. Instead you’re singing about yourself. That’s so typical of a butch. (She picks up the cushions and blankets in a huge bundle and begins to exit )
PEGGY
Just like a femme to throw a fit . . . never satisfied.
LOIS
Do you want me?
PEGGY
I always want you.
LOIS
Then you’ll have to try a little harder.
PEGGY
I’ll have to stand back. I’ll have to detach myself, like an appliance with detachable parts.
LOIS
Oh no, I want the whole damn Hoover. I want to be sucked up and ground down.
LOIS
(after the first lines of the song) That’s better. (Lois exits with the cushions , enters with six large framed photos of her body parts and places them in a semi-circle at the front of the stage. She exits and enters with a round orange carpet and places it center stage, covering the fish mosaic. She falls immediately on the carpet in several cheesecake poses. She notices the chaise longue which is now covered in red velvet, moves it onto the carpet, then falls on the couch in more poses. She notices the pedestal , removes the telephone and climbs up and sits on the pedestal in a final pose at the end of the song. The set has now been transformed to the 1970s colors and style of Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant. Throughout this next section Lois and Peggy play themselves playing with the roles of Karin and Petra from the same film. In the role of Karin, Lois speaks with a fake German accent.
PEGGY
I’m so glad you came. Are you comfortable? Can I get you anything? A snack maybe - or a drink?
LOIS
(still posing on the pedestal) Maybe later. PEGGY
LOIS
Yes, here I am.
PEGGY
Talk to me, tell me about yourself.
LOIS
What is it you want to know?
PEGGY
Anything. Everything. You past, your future. What you want to do with your life?
LOIS
Do? I don’t want to do anything. Except maybe fall in love. PEGGY
LOIS
Is it?
PEGGY
Oh yes. Though you must have had many lovers?
LOIS
I really can’t remember them. I remember cars, and fur coats and holidays, but I don’t recall faces.
PEGGY
You’re such a tease.
LOIS
Am I?
PEGGY
I find it very stimulating.
LOIS
Do you?
PEGGY
Oh yes. Tell me about your family.
LOIS
All dead.
PEGGY
All. My God.
LOIS
A boating accident. Drowned. All of them.
PEGGY
Not even one survivor.
LOIS
None.
PEGGY
A sister perhaps? Or a brother?
LOIS
None I tell you. They were horribly burnt. Unrecognizable. PEGGY
LOIS
In some ways. At least since I left Freddy.
PEGGY
Freddy?
LOIS
My lover of the last fifteen years. But it’s over now. Finished. I don’t really want to talk about it.
PEGGY
But I want you to.
LOIS
This is neither the time or the place.
PEGGY
(out of character) Going somewhere?
LOIS
( out of character) I might if you carry on treating me this way.
PEGGY
Let’s not quarrel.
LOIS
Well you started it.
PEGGY
You were the one who mentioned Freddy.
LOIS
Only as a reference to the past.
PEGGY
So tell me one thing. This Freddy. (Back in character) Is it a man or a woman?
LOIS
(in character) Does it matter? What will it tell you? For your information, Freddy was a man when I knew him. Before that? Who knows?
PEGGY
And now?
LOIS
God in Heaven! Should I care? Maybe you’re Freddy. Maybe I’m Freddy. It’s just a name. You see, you’ve upset me now. (She flails her legs in a tantrum on top of the pedestal)
PEGGY
You must be protected. After what you’ve been through. You must be looked after while you recover. (She grabs her legs to calm her)
LOIS
That’s the general idea. I’m cold. Get me a frock.
PEGGY
A frock? But I love what you have on already!
LOIS
It’s too cold for this game. Get me a dress. After all it is what you do isn’t it. You are an internationally famous clothes designer.
PEGGY
Am I? That’s right I am. (She lets go of her legs so that Lois nearly falls off the pedestal) And you are?
LOIS
On the brink . . . (she tries to regain balance) of a fabulous career.
PEGGY
As?
LOIS
(still struggling) An icon.
PEGGY
It must require very special qualities.
LOIS
Oh it does. (She finally regains composure) On the other hand, with the right wig and clever lighting . . .
PEGGY
You’re so funny.
LOIS
I am amusing in an unthreatening way and I laugh prettily at the jokes although I don’t always understand the punchline.
PEGGY
But you’re very intelligent.
LOIS
I am that too. I am also colder than I was five minutes ago.
PEGGY
The dress! I forgot. Forgive me. You can have anyone you want. (She exits)
LOIS
(taking off the apron so that she is naked except for the purple g-string) Do you have something in purple?
PEGGY
Of course.
LOIS
Skip the underwear. I find it claustrophobic.
PEGGY
But then you’ll have nothing to slip into my pocket at the coffee shop. (She hands her a purple sequined tube dress)
LOIS
I hate cappuccino.
PEGGY
I would appreciate the gesture.
LOIS
(putting on the dress) I exist only for your pleasure.
PEGGY
And I love you. I love you, I love, you, I love you. Life will be different from now on, Karin. Now we have found each other. I will spend every waking hour worshipping you. You will always be safe and I shall always protect you. I could take you apart. (She lifts her off the pedestal and holds her on her knee with one foot resting on the chaise longue) Take you apart from the hustle of the crowd to the coffee bar just before you get to the cinema near the square. And somewhere between the espresso and pannetone, between the walk and don’t walk, I could stop you just like that. Slip my hand up under your coat and feel your breasts. I know they’re there and I reach for them. Don’t pull back. Your reaction will draw attention. If you don’t look to see who’s looking, no one will. Just let me be the guard. I’ll watch and touch at the same time. It’s your job to keep still. Drink your coffee, chew your cake and swallow. I’ll feel the food as it travels down your throat. I’ll chew it for you. I’ll mix my saliva with yours to aid your digestion. Don’t move; you’ll attract attention and I won’t be able to get the zipper down without being heard. (She zips up the dress and lowers her onto the couch)
LOIS
Do you own a television?
PEGGY
Why don’t you look at me any more?
LOIS
I’m doing my toenails.
PEGGY
And then? (She gives her a hand mirror)
LOIS
I can’t read the future. I’m thirsty. Get me a drink.
PEGGY
It’s eleven o’clock in the morning.
LOIS
Not in New York.
PEGGY
Martini?
LOIS
Thank you. PEGGY
LOIS
Hasn’t everything?
PEGGY
You’ll put weight on. I say this for your own good. Because I love you.
LOIS
(looking into the mirror ) Me too.
PEGGY
You do? Say it. Just once. Say it.
LOIS
Say what?
PEGGY
I love you.
LOIS
Yeah, okay.
PEGGY
Okay what?
LOIS
You’re fine. I mean (into the mirror) I love you.
PEGGY
You are a goddess. Your hair, your eyes, your breasts . .. (she unties her cravat and signals to Lois that a different game has begun. Lois assumes a submissive position and Peggy blindfolds her with the red cravat) See these eyes? They see themselves in the mirror. They are mirrors and the desire lies in her own reflection, in the corners upside down in the brain and back out again projected onto you. You know, the way eyes do that. But femmes don’t fuck with their eyes. (She covers Lois's mouth with the cravat) You see these lips? Quivering, unable to keep still, filling up with tears that drip from the eyes. When she pouts she sees her own reflection. Lips, painted red like blood, dangerous, parting in desire. Knowing how desirable she is to you, knowing that one flick of the tongue will draw you in and capture you, hold you fast, unable to move unless she lets you in. But femmes don’t fuck with their mouths. (She binds Lois’s hands) See these hands? They want what you have. They will grab your things and add them to their own things. They want to hold it all. They think you’ve got it and they want it. The polish on the nails tells the story of green with envy, signals you all is not as it appears. But femmes don’t fuck with their hands. (She binds Lois’s feet as Lois lies on her back) You see these feet? They don’t know which way to move. They move toward you and then back, not being able to make up their minds, changing their direction ’til you go crazy. You reach for them and they’re gone, you can’t get a grasp on them. But femmes don’t fuck with their feet. (She strad-
LOIS
(bringing her face close to Peggy’s) I have a guilty secret.
PEGGY
They fuck with your minds.
LOIS
I’ve got a guilty secret. I keep it in my belly. I pass it off as wind. I got gas, I say when strangers look at me knowingly. I got a stomach ache I say and I don’t eat much - my belly’s too full, too crowded with all those secrets sloshing around, slipping into my bloodstream and making for my brain. Then I go crazy. I can handle that. I’m crazy, I say. I can’t talk to you, I’m crazy.
PEGGY
I’m crazy. Crazy for you.
LOIS
Don’t come any closer.
PEGGY
Why not?
LOIS
I’ve no deodorant on.
PEGGY
I don’t care.
LOIS
I do. Anyway I want to read my horoscope. (She lies on her stomach and looks into the mirror)
PEGGY
I can tell your future. (She climbs on top of Lois)
LOIS
Does it include you?
PEGGY
By your side. Making love to you twenty-four hours a day. (She pushes Lois down)
LOIS
Don’t you ever get tired?
PEGGY
Not with you, I would spend an eternity in your arms. LOIS
PEGGY
So, are we going to have sex now? (She pushes back down) LOIS
PEGGY
Yes. (She pushes back down)
LOIS
(crawling out from under Peggy and onto the floor) How can I have sex now when I have such a . . . stomach ache?
PEGGY
Who mentioned you?
LOIS
So you want sex with someone else?
PEGGY
I wouldn’t say no. LOIS
PEGGY
I could get excited about sex.
LOIS
But not with me?
PEGGY
Not at the moment, no.
LOIS
Who with then?
PEGGY
Come again?
LOIS
Who do you want to have sex with now, at this moment, if not with me?
PEGGY
No one in particular . . . Anyone.
LOIS
Anyone? So you’d have sex with anyone else, anyone in this whole theatre rather than with me. I’m that awful am I?
PEGGY
Why does my wanting to have sex with someone else make you an awful person? We have good sex.
LOIS
You think so?
PEGGY
Don’t you?
LOIS
Not really. Not anymore. Maybe at the beginning . . .
PEGGY
Maybe?
LOIS
... at the beginning and oh, I don’t know . . . lots of times. Like New Year’s Eve. (She removes her wig and exits, then reappears between the screens and places an orange vanity case on top of the pedestal, then stands behind it and delivers her monologue out of character) I have a guilty secret. I keep it in my basement. When I was a child I built a house in the basement. It was made from other people’s furniture and packing cases. Most of it was covered in green mold, which was appropriate since it was a house of correction. I was the madam, the director, the fiihrer. Other children would come to my house and I would tell them what to do. Binding their legs with their own underwear, I would place them in different positions, silently giving a title to the picture I had created. Sometimes I would stuff a pair of my father’s socks down the front of my pants, and if they had performed well I would let them kiss or nuzzle my crotch. I would expose their genitals. I would put sticks between the girls’ legs and rocks down the boys’ pants. Soon I gave up words and they would know by the look in my eye or the curl of my lip which tableaux to perform. No one ever said no. Not the policeman’s son or the preacher’s daughter. We all knew I had the biggest dick. (She staggers back onstage with the wig in her hand)
PEGGY
Where have you been?
LOIS
Out.
PEGGY
I know that, where?
LOIS
Dancing.
PEGGY
Alone?
LOIS
Some of the time.
PEGGY
Where did you go?
LOIS
A bar somewhere in the city. Then a club.
PEGGY
What kind of a club?
LOIS
(putting the wig back on and reassuming the character of Karin) Just an ordinary lesbian fetish club.
PEGGY
Who did you dance with?
LOIS
A woman. A beautiful lesbian boy.
PEGGY
How old was she?
LOIS
About half your age. She was very sexy.
PEGGY
Did she make love to you?
LOIS
No. She fucked me.
PEGGY
Oh God. Why do you tell me these things?
LOIS
You asked. And besides, we agreed not to lie to each other. Shall I tell you the details?
PEGGY
You disgust me.
LOIS
She had me over the seat of her Harley-Davidson.
PEGGY
With the engine running?
LOIS
Of course.
PEGGY
Were you alone?
LOIS
Apart from her friends.
PEGGY
People were watching?
LOIS
There’d be no point otherwise.
PEGGY
Why can’t you lie to me. Why can’t you tell me something I want to hear?
LOIS
Okay. It’s not true.
PEGGY
No? What were you doing?
LOIS
Walking by the river writing love poems to you. PEGGY
LOIS
Scattered on the waters!
PEGGY
That’s very beautiful.
LOIS
Thank you.
PEGGY
Is it true?
LOIS
No, of course not.
PEGGY
( taking off the wig as Lois falls into her lap) Can’t we take a break from all this? I wish we could just go to a cafe and have coffee and another coffee and read the paper. And when I’d look up between pages, I’d see you there lifting your cup to your lips. And I’d imagine how sweet they are and how hard they press against mine, like you want to smother me and punch me. And they’ll be playing Otis Redding and the coffee will be in those white heavy mugs. And it will be morning and there’ll be so much hope and endless time.
LOIS
What do you want?
PEGGY
I want what you want.
LOIS
Not fair, I want you to tell me. I want you to describe it in words that make your mouth go dry.
PEGGY
I want to lock myself up and throw away the key.
LOIS
What else do you want?
PEGGY
I want to feel hopeful.
LOIS
Okay, close your eyes and I’ll tell you all the things I’m going to do to you and it will take hours and then I’ll ask you to dance.
PEGGY
I feel hopeful already.
LOIS
Kiss me and get it over with quickly. Hurry up. Kiss me godammit. (They kiss) There now, that wasn’t as big a deal as we thought after all was it?
PEGGY
It wasn’t the kissing you that was so powerful. You shouldn’t have touched my tongue with yours. That changed things.
LOIS
I just wanted to see if you were paying attention. Are you paying attention? Can you see me? How do I look? I’m dressed. I’m ready. Shall we dance? (Cha cha music) She’s going to dance with me now .. . you’re going to dance with me. (She moves towards the audience) You’re going to lead and I will follow. (She kicks over the picture frames) I will relinquish, surrender, yield, submit. I will be seized in a state of following, in a state of two steps and high
PEGGY
( the music continues as Lois dances around Peggy) How much floor have we covered? An inch? How long have we been dancing? A second? A minute? Fifty years?
LOIS
Fifty years! And all I got was roses. I wanted pearls and you gave me roses.
PEGGY
Red is not my favorite color.
LOIS
Color me blue.
PEGGY
I sent me your blue note -
LOIS
It wasn’t perfumed. I was surprised.
PEGGY
Maybe it wore off crossing the Atlantic.
LOIS
So much is lost at sea. They say the band played on when the Titanic sank. All those notes lost at sea.
PEGGY
When I get old I’ll still slick back my hair.
LOIS
When you get old you’ll be distinguished, mature, graying around the temples. You’ll have on sensible shoes and comfortable clothes. When I get old I’ll be cold in my stockings and bare legs. I won’t be so steady on my feet and I’ll feel foolish in my lipstick. Move a little closer. (They return to the cha cha; still comic but a bit more desperate) Listen to it. Feel it. See it. Look how round . . . cha cha cha, I am . . . cha cha . . . how perfectly formed . . . cha cha cha. I wilt at the slightest compliment. I swoon at the sound of my own voice. (The monologue breaks for a dance sequence in which Lois is determined to seduce Peggy) My mother always said I would need something to fall back on ... a couch or a pair of arms and even when I was at my best she said I would have to look like I needed a little help . . . (they continue the dance) but pay close attention. (The cha cha becomes more of a tango in which Lois begins
PEGGY
I guess it was a little too far for me to go this time. I should have waited ... I should have gone slowly, I had plenty of time. I rushed it. Funny how a kiss can do that. Before there was no hurry, but once you kiss you have to have more and right away. It changes everything. (The phone rings. She dives for the phone) Hello? . . . Who is this? . . . NO!!!!!!!! (She slams down the phone. It rings) Hello? (She slams the phone down) I hate you. I hate you. (The phone rings. She picks it up angrily and then realizes it’s a friend) I’m not hungry! ... just coffee and cigarettes ... I feel fine . . . (She places the phone down. The phone rings) Hello? Who’s there? I’ll call you back; no number? . . . There must be a number, look again
LOIS
(flashing a large flashlight around the set like a searchlight and manipulating her voice as if it's coming from a loudspeaker. Peggy moves around the set trying to avoid the light) This is it! We’re closing in. No hiding any longer. It was just a matter of time and the last five minutes on that carpet was all the proof we needed. We’re just outside your window. We can see your every move. We know what you’re wearing. Your dry cleaning has given you away. (She shines the light on the typewriter. Peggy dives under the carpet and moves toward the typewriter , retrieves it and moves hack center stage , still under the carpet) We’re closing in. We’re coming in your basement. We’re unpacking hour crates and looking through your photographs. We have the purple dress. We know everything. Come on. Give it up. Hands up. Surrender.
PEGGY
Where are the walls?
LOIS
( Entering, picking up the phone and placing it backstage) Gone. Tumbled down.
PEGGY
Just now? When I was on the phone. You turn your back for five minutes and everything’s different.
LOIS
Not everything. Here, put these on. She throws Peggy a pair of pajamas similar to the ones she’s wearing) You’ll catch your death walking around in your underwear.
PEGGY
Who are you? (Lois rolls up the orange carpet , revealing the typewriter underneath) I’m sorry, I know that sounds very confrontational, but it came out like that. Who are you? How did you get in? Have I seen you before? Have they sent you? (She grabs the typewriter from Lois who is trying to read what she’s written) How can I know I can trust you?
LOIS
Don’t you remember me? (She lifts the carpet to her shoulder and turns upstage, nearly hitting Peggy on the head as she bends down to place the typewriter)
PEGGY
You seem a little familiar . . .
LOIS
(exiting with the carpet) You won’t remember me; there were so many people around.
PEGGY
I have a feeling that you’re very important to me, just give me a minute . . .
LOIS
You’ve had plenty of time already. Do you want some coffee?
PEGGY
You’re wrong. (She puts on the pajamas)
LOIS
Excuse me?
PEGGY
I said you’re wrong.
LOIS
Oh, yes, you’re right.
PEGGY
I’m usually right. Refreshing, isn’t it?
LOIS
( entering with a pillow and blanket) Start again.
PEGGY
So you’re back. (Pause) I’m sorry, it just came out like that. So you’re back.
LOIS
Yes.
PEGGY
What do you have to say for yourself? Where have you been?
LOIS
Gone.
PEGGY
Did you have a good time?
LOIS
Yes ... I missed you.
PEGGY
I couldn’t remember what you looked like and I had no photo of you. But now I remember, now that I see you.
LOIS
I’m tired. It’s like when I used to visit my mother, no matter how I felt when I got here I would always feel exhausted when I saw her and immediately fall asleep on the couch. (She falls onto the floor with her head on the pillow and covers herself with the blanket)
PEGGY
I’m not your mother.
LOIS
You bring it out in me.
PEGGY
I dreamt about you.
LOIS
Stay out of my dreams.
PEGGY
Did you dream about me at all?
LOIS
I thought about you once in a while. Do you want some coffee?
PEGGY
Okay. And cake, or no no, wait, a biscuit, the ones with the coconut shreds that stick in your teeth. You have no idea what I go though during the night. For all you know I’ll be dead when you wake up. You wouldn’t know that I’d gotten the ebola virus, lost all my teeth to that gum disease, opened a show without memorizing my lines and just missed the low interest rates and now had
LOIS
If there’s no coffee, will you have tea?
PEGGY
If I have to. In that case I can’t have a biscuit. I’ll have cake. Some of that sponge cake you make so well. I’ll have tea and cake. It makes more sense. (Lois starts to get up, then falls back to the floor, unable to stay awake.) I pretend it’s just ordinary to see you and I control myself from smashing your head into my chest to rid myself of the nightmares of losing you in the night while you sleep through it all. (Lois pulls herself to her knees and begins to crawl towards the doorway) Could you pass me the paper?
LOIS
Here. (She throws Peggy a rolled-up newspaper)
PEGGY
You want to do the crossword?
LOIS
After I’ve made the tea.
PEGGY
We’re growing older and we’re spending nights apart. When I first met you, I got down on my knees and said there wasn’t enough nights in the rest of our life together and I wanted to spend each one with you. I didn’t want to miss one. (She opens the paper to the crossword) Okay - hey - it’s been done.
LOIS
What?
PEGGY
The crossword. When did you do that? That’s not fair. We always do them together.
LOIS
(entering) Show me. That’s yesterday’s paper.
PEGGY
Where’s today’s?
LOIS
Somewhere -PEGGY
LOIS
It’s the same place. It just looks different. More relaxed. PEGGY
LOIS
In a minute. The kettle is boiling.
PEGGY
That’s not the kettle, it’s the phone.
LOIS
Shall I answer it?
PEGGY
I’m not here. I can’t speak. I’m too thirsty.
LOIS
I’ll let it ring then. (She exits)
PEGGY
Whatever. Just get me some tea. Oh yeah, your girlfriend called.
LOIS
My girlfriend called? (She enters with a deck chair in her hand)
PEGGY
She wanted to talk to you.
LOIS
What did you tell her?
PEGGY
I told her you weren’t here.
LOIS
You told her I wasn’t here?
PEGGY
Yeah.
LOIS
Who said you could say that?
PEGGY
I said so.
LOIS
You said so?
PEGGY
Yeah.
LOIS
Yeah? (They fall into the rhythm of a familiar fight/game) PEGGY
LOIS
Yeah?
PEGGY
Yeah.
LOIS
Shut up.
PEGGY
Shut up.
LOIS
Shut up.
PEGGY
You shut up.
LOIS
You shut up.
PEGGY
You shut up.
LOIS
Shut your face.
PEGGY AND LOIS
(making up) Awwwwww . . .
PEGGY
Where are we? (She sees the deck chair in Lois’s hand) We’re at the beach. My God, which beach?
LOIS
Not that beach. The film hasn’t been made yet. (She sets the deck chair up stage right) Has it? Is that what you were doing while I was away? Making movies? (She moves to the typewriter and looks at the paper)
PEGGY
(pursuing her) Yes and this is how it ends . . . the butler
LOIS
(hiding under the deck chair) Is that true?
PEGGY
No, I just made it up.
LOIS
Well then, no cause for alarm. (She sets up the deck chair stage right facing the audience)
PEGGY
Which doesn’t answer my question.
LOIS
Which is?
PEGGY
Where are we?
LOIS
Work it out. You’re the writer. Set your own scene. Describe it to me. (She sits in the deck chair)
PEGGY
1 can’t. I can’t describe a place I don’t know.
LOIS
Well then describe me. Am I bored?
PEGGY
You’re angry.
LOIS
Is there a difference?
PEGGY
I don’t know. You’ve been away. Maybe I could have answered that once but now . . . (she exits)
LOIS
So what about now? Let’s play now.
PEGGY
Don’t want to. (She looks through the props and set pieces (( off stage”)
LOIS
Go on.
PEGGY
No.
LOIS
Why not?
PEGGY
I can’t make up now. I can only invent the past or the future.
LOIS
We can imagine.
PEGGY
Your imagination’s too terrifying.
LOIS
Not if you write it down.
PEGGY
Then it’s history.
LOIS
Then it’s a lie.
PEGGY
So how do you record the truth?
LOIS
Whose truth? I’m not looking for truth. I’m looking for opinions. What’s your opinion of me?
PEGGY
You want the truth?
LOIS
No! I want your opinion.
PEGGY
That’s a different story.
LOIS
Where I come from a story was as good as a lie. Lie was a dirty word. It sounded dirty in the mouth. Maybe that was from the threat of soap. I used to imagine the whole bar in my mouth with the suds dripping down my chin, more afraid of choking on it than of the taste. So if you told a lie it was a story. Maybe that’s how I developed my distaste . . . for story . . . like the bar of soap . . . not something I can truthfully say belongs in my mouth.
PEGGY
(entering with another deck chair and the book Venus in Furs and sitting in the deck chair, perpendicular to Lois) I’ll tell you a story.
LOIS
A lie you mean.
PEGGY
I met a princess today.
LOIS
How do you know she was a princess?
PEGGY
She had a long name.
LOIS
Did she have golden hair?
PEGGY
No.
LOIS
Then she’s a fake.
PEGGY
She made me feel old . . . and . . .
LOIS
You’re not too old. Well you’re not too old for me and . . . I’m not too old for you . . .
PEGGY
You did it again.
LOIS
I did what again?
PEGGY
You cut me off.
LOIS
I cut you off?
PEGGY
I don’t remember what I was going to say.
LOIS
Oh yeah and why not?
PEGGY
’Cause you interrupted me.
LOIS
That’s because you were taking too long.
PEGGY
You think so?
LOIS
Yeah, I think so.
PEGGY
Yeah? (They fall into the same rhythm of the fightlgame that occurred earlier in this section)
LOIS
Yeah.
PEGGY
Yeah?
LOIS
Yeah.
PEGGY
Shut up.
LOIS
Shut up.
PEGGY
Shut up.
LOIS
You shut up.
PEGGY
You shut up.
LOIS
You shut up.
PEGGY
Shut your face.
LOIS AND PEGGY
(making up) Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww . . . The phone rings.
PEGGY
That’ll be your girlfriend. (Lois goes for the phone and it stops ringing)
LOIS
Start again.
PEGGY
What?
LOIS
Let’s make a clean slate. Start again.
PEGGY
I’ll have to empty my heart. I don’t know if I can do that. The phone rings.
PEGGY
That’ll be your girlfriend.
LOIS
(going for the phone; it stops) Start again, that didn’t work. PEGGY
LOIS
We’re in different moods.
PEGGY
Then we probably aren’t playing right.
LOIS
Then start again.
PEGGY
I have more important things to think about.
LOIS
I’ll check on the kettle. (She goes for the phone and it stops before she gets to it) Who is it?
PEGGY
Wrong number. (The phone rings once and stops) Wrong number.
LOIS
Wrong number, again?
PEGGY
Thirteen calls in fifteen minutes. It’s beginning to worry me.
LOIS
Thirteen! If everything you said was true you’d be two hundred years instead of fifty. (She exits and searches through “back-stage” props)
PEGGY
Why tell a story unless it’s exaggerated? If I feel a relationship was fifty years long, then calling it “fifty years,” rather than the fifteen it was, is truth. The calendar is not truth. Everything that goes into that relationship affects how time feels . . . Why not be creative?
LOIS
(picking up a tennis racket) Okay, let’s be creative.
PEGGY
Sexually?
LOIS
(peering around from behind the folded screens) Yeah, you start.
PEGGY
Seducing you, you mean?
LOIS
No, let’s change it. I’ll seduce you.
PEGGY
How will I know when you start?
LOIS
You’ll know.
PEGGY
Are you in the mood?
LOIS
You want the truth?
PEGGY
I know the truth.
LOIS
(entering with the tennis racket in her hand) Why do you always say that?
PEGGY
Because it’s true.
LOIS
And you exaggerate everything.
PEGGY
I exaggerate everything?
LOIS
Yeah and you can’t see past the nose on your own face. PEGGY
LOIS
And you have one thing on your mind.
PEGGY
Yeah?
LOIS
Yeah!
PEGGY
Yeah?
LOIS
(entering again into the rhythm of the fight!game, but this time the words are barely audible and only the rhythm remains) Yeah.
PEGGY
Shut up.
LOIS
Shut Up.
PEGGY
Shut up.
LOIS
Shut Up.
PEGGY
Shut up.
LOIS
Shut up.
PEGGY AND LOIS
Awwwwwww . . .
LOIS
Guess what I brought you?
PEGGY
A nice cup of tea?
LOIS
A tennis racket.
PEGGY
A tennis racket? I wanted a whip!
LOIS
Well then, your serve. (She hands Peggy the racket)
PEGGY
No, what I wanted was some commonplace sadism like in French films.
LOIS
So you’re not a real sadist?
PEGGY
Of course not.
LOIS
What are you, then?
PEGGY
I’m researching for a screenplay. Obviously, I’ll have to invent it myself.
LOIS
You can do that. You’re a writer.
PEGGY
Relax. There’ll be a perfectly reasonable explanation.
LOIS
Someone could be trying to get through.
PEGGY
Who?
LOIS
I don’t know. Anyone. Someone . . . Someone could be trying to contact us and repeatedly get the busy signal and will sooner or later get tired of trying and give up, and not bother to call again.
PEGGY
Like your girlfriend?
LOIS
Like the Chinese takeaway.
PEGGY
You’re right. (She exits)
LOIS
( moving her deck chair downstage right) It’s been two weeks since we ordered and I’m starving.
PEGGY
(entering with a blanket and pillow) There’s some jam in the fridge.
LOIS
I ate it. (She exits)
PEGGY
When?
LOIS
With a friend.
PEGGY
You slut that was our jam.
LOIS
Relax, there’s lots of jars in the back. (She enters with a long string of fairy lights and begins to hang them across the set pieces and props at the back of the stage so that when they are lit they resemble city lights)
PEGGY
They’re full of air. (She moves her deck chair downstage left and sits)
LOIS
Air?
PEGGY
From Amsterdam and Hawaii. Berlin, New York . . . We had air from London but it got used up when you went away. When I breathed it I could see you singing for me while I lifted you in the air.
LOIS
How high?
PEGGY
As high as I could. We told each other secrets.
LOIS
Where?
PEGGY
In the basement.
LOIS
Were we hiding?
PEGGY
From the guests we’d forgotten we’d invited.
LOIS
What did we do?
PEGGY
We went swimming in the ocean. You wore a purple dress. LOIS
PEGGY
Not exactly.
LOIS
What time is it?
PEGGY
Late, I think.
LOIS
I miss having windows.
PEGGY
That’s your fault.
LOIS
My fault? How come?
PEGGY
You took the walls down. No walls. No windows.
LOIS
What comes down must go up.
PEGGY
Not necessarily.
LOIS
How SO?
PEGGY
Ask your mother.
LOIS
Meaning?
PEGGY
About your father’s pajama pants - “What can’t get up, can’t get out.”
LOIS
Start again.
PEGGY
No walls, no windows, no doors.
LOIS
We never had doors.
PEGGY
No door, no locks.
LOIS
No locks, no keys.
PEGGY
No keys, no car.
LOIS
Well, that’s that then. No escape.
PEGGY
A car! That’s a great idea! (She moves onto her hands and knees in front of the typewriter)
LOIS
For what?
PEGGY
The end of the screenplay could be a car chase. For instance, the transgendered movie star, after re-uniting with her lover, the maid, is pursued across Germany by the . . . Interpol, the FBI and the CIA and . . .
LOIS
The House on Un-American Activities . . .
PEGGY
And the House on Un-American Activities Committee and end up . . .
LOIS
Going over a cliff.
PEGGY
Going over a cliff!
LOIS AND PEGGY
Naaaaaaaaawwwwwwwww!!!
BLACKOUT
A love song in the style of “The Ten
LOIS
( reading from the rolled paper) Her hands felt like cold steel when I grabbed onto them. I walked and walked along the river until I found her in the park, all bold and dark and huge, in the fading light of an already gray day. Her arm was upraised and I could see the veins in her forearm. From where I stood her hands looked enormous, half the size of her arm. Her fingers were worn out on the edges from so many people touching her. I grabbed her giant hand where the steel had actually changed color and wanted her to lift me up and take me to a safe place. Her hand was cold from the metal it was made of and from the autumn air, and although it felt strong and solid and hard and capable of lifting me, it didn’t move, it didn’t budge, even with my whole body weight pulling on it. All there was left for me to do was to pull myself up with the strength of my own body and caress her cold arched back and ass beneath the folds of material and then slide down onto the bright grass and sit on the wooden bench by the river and add my tears to the Thames, to the thousands of tears already churning in that fast moving river. The waves lapping on that strange dark small beach along the wall sound like an ocean, covering the loud smacks of my heart against my chest. My mother told me keep moving. So I took her with me. I picked her off the bench and it started bells ringing, all of them including Big Ben. (There are the sounds of a riverside park with a bell chiming in the distance) They wouldn’t stop so I covered my ear with one hand while pulling her across Trafalgar Square with the other. Pushing and pulling her to Charing Cross, trying to make sense of her cold steel hands, her desire run cold. And then throwing myself into the early evening London alley where every place I knew was shut. In the fake city of London. (The fairy lights fade up, resembling the night view of a city from across
PEGGY
(taking the scroll of paper from Lois's hand and replacing it with a cup of tea) Do you know when I was in high school I learned geography on a map that showed that the United States was bigger than Russia.
LOIS
No!
PEGGY
You see, there’s a lot of things you don’t know about me.
