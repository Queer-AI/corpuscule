PART ONE

NARRATOR
Finally, the story they said couldn't be told shatters the airwaves! Brought to you by House of Shag'N'Stuff, where tomorrow's carpets are here today, and by Clams A-Go-Go of Passaic, where our motto is: "Shellfish is a swell dish!" Happy housewives know that when it comes to eating out, nine out of ten men think of one thing:

MAN #1
Give me fish!

MAN #2
I want filet!

NARRATOR
And remember! We deliver! When you're thinking of sending something special to that special someone, why not say it with fish!
WOMAN
Yes?

DELIVERY BOY
Three shrimp dinners!

WOMAN
I didn't order any shrimp dinners …. This must be somebody's idea of a sick joke!

( Door slam.)

NARRATOR
Yes! That's exactly right! It's the Well—


( Cast screams.)

NARRATOR
—of Horniness! The continuing saga of one woman's sojourn in the septic tank

( toilet flush)

of the soul!

LOUISE
Harold! Come over here! Right this minute!

HAROLD
What is it, Louise?

LOUISE
It's those two new girls on the block, Harold, something about the way they walk, something about the way they talk … something about the way they look … at each other …. Harold, I could swear they're Lebanese!

( Theme from "Twilight Zone.")

HAROLD
You're just imagining things, Louise. They're just a couple of sorority girls.

NARRATOR
Have we got news for you, Harold. Those two girls are members of the Tridelta Tribads, an alleged sorority, but in reality just a thinly veiled entrance to the Well

( scream)

of Horniness! The setting, a peaceful New England town, just a town like many others, a town that clasped American values to her bosom!

( Baby crying.)

An American town—where every winter day is a white Christmas

( humming "White Christmas")

and every Wednesday night is Prince Spaghetti Night!

( Female voice calls: "Anthony!")

Just a town, a town like many others with its local pubs and taverns.

( Cork pop. WAITER's voice: "Monsieur, ze Blue Nun, ze 1979!")

And dinner theatres where tone deaf emcees flourish and where the citizens can go to meet or cheat that someone special. But beneath the apparently serene breast of new-fallen snow, a whirlpool rages ….

( sucking noises)

sucking the weak, the infirm, the original, and all others who don't wear beige down … down, down. As carrots in the Cuisinart …

( blender)

so are souls in the Well

( scream)

of Horniness! Meet Georgette.

( Phone dialing.)

GEORGETTE
Hello, White Casa? The usual. You know the way I like it—extra hot.

NARRATOR
Coming from one of the town's most established families, her pedigree was unblemished except for a drop of Catholic blood on her mother's side of the family. But underneath the cloak of respectability, evil budded in her bosom. By the time she had pledged her college sorority, Georgette had already fallen into the Well

( scream)

of Horniness! And Vicki, the town's leading Excedrin consumer:

VICKI
Darn these childproof tops!

NARRATOR
A recent emigrée to this town like many others, she came to this quiet hamlet to forget. By day she clips coupons

( scissors)

and attends Aquacise classes. By night she prays for amnesia. Few would guess this well-groomed word-processing trainee was once of the sisterhood of sin. The memories gnaw at her mind like starving hamsters in a Kleenex box.

( Scratching.)

Is there any hope for Vicki? Is there any hope for anyone once they've fallen into the Well

( scream)

of Horniness? And here's Rod:

ROD
Honey, I'm home! Hey, hey, hey, whatcha got for me?

( Glasses clinking.)

VICKI
I made some Harvey Wallbangers!

NARRATOR
Vicki's fiancée, Georgette's brother Rod, once had dreams of becoming a golf pro. But like many young men of his milieu, his youthful idealism was trampled by his drive for success. The punch bowl from his graduation open-house was barely drained when he became a VP in the family business—a chain of discount carpet warehouses. Rod and Vicki—on the surface just a couple of lovebirds

( kiss)

about to tie the knot!

( Choking sounds.)

Then our happy couple makes a date with destiny.

( Theme from "Jeopardy.")

ROD
Hey, Vick, whaddya say to a little R'N'R?

VICKI
Uh, okay.

ROD
Why don't I give my sister Georgette a ring? I been dying for the two of you to meet.

VICKI
Oh, Rod, I really don't feel up to a crowd.

ROD
What's a crowd? She's family. Besides, you'll love her and

( snaps his fingers)

come to think of it … you two were in different chapters of the same sorority!

VICKI
What did you say, dear?

ROD
The same sorority … the Tridelta Tribads. Come on, Vick, I remember how you loved that club and those gals!

VICKI
You don't understand, I can never see those women again.

ROD
So who says you have to mention the sorority at all … you'll be gabbing about color swatches and floor buffers. Why in no time at all you'll be bosom buddies.

( Rod picks up telephone.)

VICKI
Now I'll never be able to keep the secret of my past from him—those so-called sorority sisters!

NARRATOR
Vicki—a would-be word-processor with a past she can't outrun!

VICKI
I can't believe his sister is one of them! They are … everywhere!

NARRATOR
Later that night, Rod and Vicki arrive at the fabulous new dinner theater, The Vixen's Den, where Georgette is already waiting.

BABS
Miss, you're gonna have to check that—oh, have't seen you in a while.

GEORGETTE
Oh, hi, how ya doing.

BABS
Since when do you care? Oh, sorry … it's just that … I thought … I mean … after we spent … together … it was special …

GEORGETTE
Can it, Babs, I'm here to meet my family. Hey, Babs—who's that foxy lady over by the palsms? Whatsa scoop on her?

WAITRESS
Miss, would you like a drink while you're waiting?

VICKI
Uh, I'd like a Harvey Wallbanger. Uh, miss, make it a double.

BABS
I don't know and I don't care!

GEORGETTE
Yeah, well I do. See ya around, Babs ….

BABS
Ah, okay, Georgette. Call me or I'll call you, okay Georgette, okay? If I said anything mean about the way we were, I didn't mean it ….

NARRATOR
Georgette cuts through the dining room as surely as a honey bee picks out the last wildflower in a filed of crab grass. And where is our hero? There he is, threading his way through the salad bar ….

( Dishes scraping.)

ROD
Pardon me, ma'am, but somebody else might want some croutons, too.

NARRATOR
Will Rod return in time to save his beloved from the predatory clutches of his own flesh and blood … ? We'll find out after this word from our sponsor ….

ROD
High cost of wall-to-wall keeping you awake at night? Like to cover up the cement floor in the master bedroom with a little snazzy something or other, but can't shell out an arm or a leg? Then visit New England's chain of carpet warehouses—House of Shang'N'Stuff. We're open twenty-four hours to serve you better! Take a look at these beauties! Oh, sorry, we're on the radio. Just listen to these colors! You wouldn't believe how loud they are: Green! Red! Orange! Yellow! Hot Pink! Yes siree, this week, and this week only, we're running a chainwide special on these polytrilon, one-hundred-percent washable throwrugs in designer colors! Throw 'em anywhere, the kitchen, living room, throw 'em at the kids … heh-heh! Dads! Tired of mowing that big green expanse of nothingness? Got a fortune sunk in weed killer? Pave the whole thing over and just toss around a few of these babies for accent! They'll never notice and I'll never tell! Once you see our low, low prices and easy terms you'll be bitten by the bug, too! Shag Fever! So hurry on down to any one of our convenient locations or come by our main branch and showroom right off Route 17 in this town, a town like many others!


(VICKI and GEORGETTE stand frozen during the monologue, in near-embrace.)

ROD
Vicki, hon, this is my sister Georgette. Hey, I'm so glad the two of you, my two favorite gals, are finally meeting.

GEORGETTE
So lovely.

( She kisses VICKI's hand.)

VICKI
Enchantée, I'm sure.

WAITRESS
The Pasta Arrivederci … coming in for a landing.

(GEORGETTE starts slurping on noodles.)

ROD
Georgette! For Chrissakes, this isn't a hamburger joint!

NARRATOR
Despite her resolve, Vicki finds she cannot resist the way Georgette plays with her food.

GEORGETTE
Whatsamatter honey? You sit in a puddle, or you just glad to see me?

WAITRESS
Excuse me, Miss, are you gonna order anything or are you just gonna eat hers?

ROD
Noodles all around, Garçonette, and while you're at it, how's about a little fruit of the vine to wash this slop down?

WINE STEWARD
Very well, Monsieur!

(STEWARD pours wine all over GEORGETTE's blouse.)

Oh, pardon! How clumsy of me.

ROD
Will ya get a load of that! What is it with you guys? Run a Wet T-Shirt contest on the side?

VICKI
Let me try! Usually if you get it while it's still damp …

ROD
Well, whaddya know? It's another testimonial to the miracle of synthetics!

( Fork falls.)

NARRATOR
As Vicki's fork clatters to the ground, something darker than etiquette draws Vicki down.

VICKI
Excuse me.

NARRATOR
What began innocently enough, takes a turn for the worse underneath the table. Vicki finds no cutlery, but Georgette's legs, two succulent rainbows leading to the same pot of gold.

ROD
I suppose I should wait until after dinner, but I really want to pick your brains on some of the places I've been looking into as possible honeymoon hideaways.

(ROD pulls a bunch of brochures out of his jacket pocket.)

I'm looking for something that has a lot to offer, particularly a good golf course. I bought Vick a set of clubs for her last birthday and darn it all if she doesn't have a better putt than I do! Well, that's neither here nor there. I just mean you can't spend all your time in bed, hah-hah. Right? This South Seas plantation offers a lot—twenty minutes from the Tampa-St. Pete Airport, and ninety minutes from Disney World and Busch Gardens. And Georgette, get a load of this private beach. It's pretty reasonable, too, if we take the American plan. The breakfast, the greens' fees and happy hour are thrown in. Although I must say I'm a bit wary of these all-inclusive deals! There's always hidden charges that amount to no savings at all. You gotta be careful, these damned travel agents see the rock on her finger and the stars in my eyes and they'll soak ya every time, I swear to God, and they'll laugh all the way to the bank, am I right? Well, here's some of the brochures—they all look great on paper. You can take a gander at them after dinner and Vicki wanted to … hey, hey, Vick, what's up? You find that fork yet?

VICKI
I see it but I can't quite reach it.

ROD
Well for Chrissakes, let's get the waitress. Vick—whatsa matter? You come up too soon?

VICKI
I feel a little hot, Rod. Maybe I'd better go freshen up.

ROD
You do.

(VICKI exits.)

Georgette, I'm a bit concerned with Vicki lately.

GEORGETTE
Yeah?

ROD
Something's fishy, I can't quite put my finger on it, can you?

GEORGETTE
I'm working on it. Maybe I'd better go check on her.

(GEORGETTE exits.)

ROD
Great, I'd hate for her to miss the floor show.

NARRATOR
But their romantic powder-room rendezvous is cut short!

( Gun shot.)

WAITRESS
Omigod! She's been shot!

NARRATOR
As Georgette's perforated remains cool by the powder room, Vicki gives the maître d' the slip.

VICKI
( hands waitress a slip)

: Could you wrap this for me?

NARRATOR
And is swallowed by the silent orifice

( swallowing sounds)

of the night.

NEWSBOY
Extra, extra! Read all about it! Future carpet queen slays sister-in-law during floor show!

NARRATOR
Vicki—ruthless killer, or just a girl with a lot of luck, all of it bad? We'll find out, after this word from our sponsor!

ROD
That's right … House of Shag'N'Stuff is expanding! We've opened a whole new floor with plenty of eager beaver sales people to serve you better! Here's one of them now. Come up here, little lady, and tell us all about it.

SALES LADY
Attention, Art Mart shoppers! We have a blue light special in the Generic Modernist department. In order to make room for the new '84s

( slash)

And while you're Art Marting, visit the deli and check out the new weiner wonder, "Pesto Pup"

( pup barking)

—cuisine on a stick. Thank you for Art Marting!

NARRATOR
But what really happened that fateful night at the salad bar? Was it something in the vinaigrette? Was there someone else who could have pulled the trigger? To many, the flight of the ex-muff-diver, future mop-squeezer, Vicki, was as good as a confession. What else but terrible guilt could make a woman in heels sprint? For in the cramped quarters of the gay-girl ghetto, blowing your girlfriend to kingdom come could be written off as taking your space! And what about Babs, the hat-check girl? Their one-night-stand left Babs stranded high on the bunny slope of love.

BABS
One night? It was a whole ski weekend at Stowed Finger Lodge!

NARRATOR
Who killed Georgette? And who cares? And what will become of Vicki? Could it be she faces a brighter future in a prison rehab program than in today's saturated word-processing field? And then there's Rod … whose entire life soured between the salad bar and the powder-room. For answers to these and even more trivial questions, watch for the next episode of the Well

( scream)

of Horniness.

BLACKOUT

NOTE: Stage directions throughout refer to sound effects unless otherwise indicated.

Scene 2: Victim Victoria
PART TWO: Victim Victoria

NARRATOR
The Well

( scream)

of Horniness! Part Two, "Victim Victoria." The setting, a peaceful New England town. A town like many others where murder and depravity offer a welcome respite from the tedious convenience of one-stop shopping. Just a town, a town like many others … with a gorgeous gendarme who loves girls almost as much as she loves murder.

MCCLIT
Garnet McClit, lady dick.

( Typewriters, police station office. Enter AL DENTE.)

NARRATOR
It was another spit-colored Manhattan morning. Al Dente found the usual cornucopia of crimes cluttered his desk at the New York precinct. The police chief was a cop's cop: tough and stringy as a pot roast with a face to match.

( Office intercom buzzing.)

DENTE
Yeah?
SECRETARY

( through intercom)

: Got a make on that DOA, chief.

DENTE
Okay. Send in Garnet McClit. Looks like this is her baby.


(GARNET enters. GARNET and AL size each other up.)

NARRATOR
Enter Garnet McClit, lady dick. An inspired Irish rookie from the concrete backwaters of the Garden State. Being an Irish tomboy left her with two options: the convent or the beat. She went with the latter, with no regrets. Once in a while, though, she dreamed of heading someplace more romantic, like Milwaukee, where being a cop and being Irish still meant something.

MCCLIT
Whatsa scoop, Chief?

DENTE
Your lucky day, McClit. You play it smart and this'll get you outta parking violations and into the big leagues. You know that new Amazon watering hole?

MCCLIT
The Vixen's Den?

DENTE
Yeah. Well, the boys just paid it a little visit.

MCCLIT
Snazzy joint. Food any good?

DENTE
They couldn't stick around to find out so they just got something to go. A stiff. Here, read all about it. Didn't take long for those nutty dames to start making pesto of each other.

MCCLIT
Georgette, that's bad.

DENTE
Big wheel, huh? Well, she's stopped turning.

MCCLIT
There's going to be trouble, Chief. Those tribads gotta short fuse. When the New York Pest gets a hold of this …

DENTE
Forget the Pest. When our boys get through rounding up their head honchas, those bra burners won't be able to get together a softball game, let alone a rumble. Gotta line on the suspect?

MCCLIT
Vicki, yeah. I know her. Who doesn't? Heard she defected a few years back. Word was she'd turned a real Breck girl. Gotta job, boyfriend, the works.


DENTE
She gave the maître d' the slip. We'll bag her soon enough, though. She can't go too far too fast in those heels. Tell me, how do those tribads feel towards a girl once she had a change of heart?

MCCLIT
I've been sniffing around this scene a long time. I seen a lotta these broads make a beeline for the straight and narrow. But I'm telling you, none of them has made it to the altar yet.

DENTE
So they take it kinda personal when one of the flock goes AWOL?

MCCLIT
Lets just say the tribads are not exactly pro-family.

DENTE
Are these dames ditzy enough to frame Vicki?

MCCLIT
No way, Chief. Vicki's a lotta things, but she's just not suitable for framing.

DENTE
Any way you slice it, it's our chance to bust up this daisy chain for keeps.

MCCLIT
Maybe so. Still these muff-divers have been spoiling for a rumble and now they've got an excuse. There's gonna be one helluva crackdown.

DENTE
You mean … ?

MCCLIT
What I'm saying is this: until you get that word-processor on ice, there's not a bisexual between here and Scranton that'll be safe.


(Blackout. Lights up in forest scene. VICKI running in circles.)


NARRATOR
Vicki ran and ran. Without direction, though not without purpose. But why did she run, if she were, indeed, innocent? Perhaps in her heart of hearts, there was something she longed fur more fervently than justice or even her own freedom. A sequel, perhaps? As the Zen masters have said: what is the sound of one hand clapping? Or as the TV moguls restated: what is the use of one great pilot without a thirteen-week run? And so Vicki ran until the wilderness lay all around her. Vicki knew she was lost. Alone with the elements.

Disembodied Voice Of God Or Carl Sagan Doing God
Oxygen, helium, hydrogen and whiskey sours, these elements form the building blocks of life as we know it.


( Twing snaps. Animal sounds.)

NARRATOR
Or was she alone? Her soul called out to the heavens

( phone being dialed)

… but as usual got a busy signal.

( phone busy signal. Ominous bird calls.)

Overhead, three bald scavengers circled with the deadly precision of a lazy Susan laden with tainted hors d'oeuvres.

VICKI
Who's there? Yoo hoo, here I aim.

NARRATOR
Somewhere in the uncharted recesses of her mind, Vicki knew she was the heroine and could not be killed off. Not with a series in the offing.


( Dream sequence music, with typing sounds.)


NARRATOR
Perhaps her old college chum, the writer, might construct a few close calls. She might have to run down a few blind alleys, in orthopedically hazardous footgear, bullets of myopic snipers snagging her nylons.


( During this narration, VICKI acts out her fantasy of landing a guest spot on a TV dectective show. She shifts into a more operatic mode.)

NARRATOR
Or perhaps it would be a gothic affair. She might be compelled to run across the moors, in a flimsy peignoir, nipples baying at the north star. But this much was certain: she would be rescued.


( Footsteps. A shadow approaches and eclipses VICKI.)

VICKI
Oh, no, no, no, God, no. You're not William Shatner.

NARRATOR
William Shatner? Is he in this?


( Blackout. Lights up on street scene with GARNET.)

NARRATOR
For Garnet McClit, seasoned sapphic flatfoot, Al Dente's theories were as meaningless as pork fried rice without the duck sauce. Who pulled the trigger and why? Vicki's guilt was another stale assumption she wouldn't buy and couldn't swallow. Pass the mayo, please. No, to Garnet, the field was wide open. So that left just … everybody. Only problem was--everybody seemed to have an alibi as airtight as a Tupperware cakesaver. Only person Garnet hadn't checked out was Babs, the hat-check girl. Sure, she knew Georgette had had a fling with her. So what? Tribads were known to change partners more times than Masons in a three-legged relay. Would Georgette have jeopardized a promising career in dental hygiene for a few moments of empty ecstasy with a hat-check girl? A woman whose phony accent fooled no one about her bridge-and-tunnel origins? Garnet didn't think so. Still … what about their affair? Just a Sunday drive—or a joy ride thru the Well

( scream; sound of falling body and splash)

of Horniness. Georgette was six feet under. Her side of the story died with her. But if she could have talked, what would she say?


GEORGETTE
( voiceover that comes out of nowhere, or more exactly, through an offstage reverb mike)

: Just in case you really want to know, Babs was the best-looking thing I ever saw. I got steamed up watching her cross the street. Whatever a broad's supposed to have on the ball, she's got it. My tongue felt a foot thick when we talked and if she'd asked me to jump, I'd a said, "How high?" So why'd I dump her? I'll tell you this. And you can tuck it away if it means anything to you. I don't like her and I don't know why.

MCCLIT
I wished I'd gotten the specs on the hat-check hussy. I wouldn't know her if she got in bed with me.

( Blackout. Ominous organ stab. Lights up in coffee shop with ROD and AL.)

ROD
When that deal on the linoleum mine comes through, I'll have the entire home-decorating industry painted into a corner.

DENTE
Don't get me wrong, Rod, my boy, idealism is great, especially in an election year. But you gotta remember you're talking about South America, you're talking about a lotta Catholics ….

ROD
What are you driving at, my man?

DENTE
I'm talking about Catholics—whole different ball game.

ROD
Is it as bad as all that? I mean they're still human.


DENTE
Human, yes, but they're afraid of patent leather. They do it in the middle of the day and eat macaroni and cheese after. They think God is made out of plastic and glows in the dark. Human, I wonder …

ROD
I know what you're trying to do, AI, but I gotta dream. Something to keep me going. I'm not going to give it up … it's all I got … now. I still think we got the right to a few things. To a roof over our head. To a nice piece of shag under your feet.

DENTE
Don't go too far, my boy, it's not just the Catholic thing here …. Some of these people aren't even white and put that in your pipe and smoke it. Shag, Rod, you're gonna give 'em shag? These people live in paper sacks and eat what the dog wouldn't touch. And why? Because they're lazy. Too damn lazy to go shopping. And frankly I just don't see how giving away throw rugs to Salvador is going to change all that.

ROD
Well, it won't. At least, not overnight.


( Pinteresque pause. Audience gets nervous, thinking the show has taken a bad turn.)

DENTE
Take a tip from me, all that lioneum ain't going to keep you warm at night.

ROD
Whatcha got for me?

DENTE
I gotta very classy dame for you … very low mileage … and she don't take tips ….


ROD
Can that fish, Al, I'm through with the lousy broads you dig up. The last one was so skinny I coulda sliced semolina on her hip bones.


( Blackout on ROD and AL. Lights up on street scene.)

NARRATOR
Garnet McClit took a long drag on her cigarette and leaned against the tenement doorway. She studied the glowing butt. And flicked it into the gutter. It was 11:30 P.M. on the Lower East Side. Most of the natives were just getting up. Then Garnet saw her.


( Enter BABS.)

NARRATOR
Something strangely exotic about the eyes, the way they seemed to float in her face like two wontons in a hot and sour soup. Her full figure stood out in sharp contrast to the clusters of anorexic clubgoers beginning to fill the street. Someone or something in Garnet's brain sent a wake-up call to her crotch.

MCCLIT
What're you doing out at this hour, hon? Pretty girl like you oughta be home, watching the funny car races.

BABS
It's curtains for me and my gal. Like she just didn't meet my needs. Besides, she was just a runt.

MCCLIT
You like big girls, huh?

NARRATOR
In the harsh light of the ghetto street lamp, the woman's eyes glittered like a tape measure. Garnet seemed to make the grade.


BABS
That's right. Real big. Like you.

MCCLIT
Too bad I'm a career girl.

BABS
Oh, I really go for girls with Blue Cross. You don't work around the clock, now, do you, Ms˙ Officer?

MCCLIT
I go home. Alone. To sleep.

BABS
Oh, that's too bad. Guess I gotta go sit on that tar beach all by my lonesome.

MCCLIT
What tar beach is that?

BABS
Just down the street. Sometimes I get real lonesome up there, just me and my Walkman.

NARRATOR
Watching her turn and walk away made the insides of Garnet's thighs feel like butter left out on a hot stove. But she was too much of a cop to cave in to simple lust. Just a fleshy little trashpasser—oh, excuse me, that's flashy little trespasser—Garnet thought, as she followed her into the building.


( As GARNET enters the building, BABS clubs hero. BABS grabs GARNET's gun.)

BABS
Ooh, picking up a bargain like this puts a girl in a mood for a real shopping spree. Something in the home improvement line. I gotta feeling a certain carpet salesman might feel like doing some private price slashing.



NARRATOR
Can she be stopped?

( Organ stab.)

Can a clerical worker who's tasted blood ever hope to break into middle management?

( Organ stab.)

Can anyone be satisfied once they've dipped into the Well

( scream)

of Horniness? Even as Babs weaves her wicked web, our hero is engaging in some innocent male bonding in another part of town.


( Blackout. Lights up in coffee shop with ROD and AL.)

ROD
Hey, buddy, do you see a waitress?

DENTE
I see this woman in white. But I don't think she's a waitress.

ROD
Why not?

DENTE
'Cause she looks like we're sick. What do you think about that?

ROD
I think we are sick and she's the cure. Hey nurse, nurse, me and my buddy are dying of hunger.


(WAITRESS enters. Maxwell House jingle is played. WAITRESS sets coffee cups down on table.)

ROD
Miss, is this decaf?

WAITRESS
But you said coffee.

ROD
But I meant Sanka brand coffee.

WAITRESS
Why didn't you tell me you didn't want real coffee?



ROD
Well now, Miss, Sanka brand is real coffee, isn't that right, Al?

DENTE
Sure is, Rob. Howsabout joining us for a cup, Miss?


( Exit WAITRESS.)

DENTE
You're still thinking about her, aren't ya?


(ROD sighs.)

DENTE
I'm going to say something and I don't think you're gonna be able to hear it, but Vicki was a cheap little poodle of a woman. She flunked outta community college and probably killed your sister.

ROD
Lies! Lies! I will not hear it! Vicki went away to school!

DENTE
Yeah, away to the Hoboken bilingual keypunch school. Hardly the Seven Sisters, now is it?

ROD
But I still love her!

DENTE
Rod, my friend, someday you're gonna find you got off easy. The woman had no depth. Taking the plunge with her woulda been like highdiving off the shallow end.

NARRATOR
Rod felt he could forgive Vicki everything, even her fried chicken, if only he could have her back. Suddenly, he felt protective towards her, the way sauteed onions must feel towards calves' liver.


( Lights down on coffee shop, up on the forest. VICKI is softly giggling with an unseen admirer.)



NARRATOR
Even as Rod finds himself knee-deep in thought, our finely wrought fiction is unraveling in another area.


( Theme music up under following, probably "America the Beautiful" would be the most appropriate.)

NARRATOR
To the north lay the majestic Catatonics. To the work-weary masses, these are the promised lands … where God's chosen people have chosen to spend forty days and forty nights in the wilderness, on the American plan. But the granite cleavage did not contain happy memories for Rod. For it was there during a family vacation, that his other sister, Dinette, was snatched from their campsite by ravenous raccoons. The family was left stunned, and … bitter! No more Sierra Club calendars for them! Even with the family in the carpet trade, it was the kind of scandal you couldn't sweep under the rug.

RANGER
They finally found that little tyke. What was left of her, anyway.

DEPUTY
Born with a silver spoon in her mouth.

RANGER
That's probably why they killed her.

NARRATOR
There was no way they could know their daughter lived, nor that the carcass found outside the Winnebago was not Dinette, but, in fact … a London Broil!

( Sizzle.)

Dinette remembered none of this. Not her brother Rod, twin Georgette, nor the split-level mediterranean mansion. Suckled by her ring-tailed abductors, she became like them—forced to hunt and prowl by night like the hideous half-human apparitions that haunt late-night TV. Roots, berries, and an occasional Eskimo Pie—on these she thrived. The forest provided her with all she needed; that is, except for the one thing she craved the most—entrance to the Well

( scream)

of Horniness. But now she had Vicki. She had hit rock bottom! Happy at last! It was a muggy summer night in the mountains. The clouds rested like soggy cotton balls upon the brow of the mountain. It was a night made just for lovers. Somewhere a loon cried.

Madge, what'd you do with the keys to the Buick?

NARRATOR
From their seclusion in the Christmas tree farm, the wild lovers watched the last rounds of a sudden-death golf tournament. How could they know the danger that surrounded them?


( Sound effects of faraway police sirens, drawing nearer. Offstage voice yells "Fore!" Golf balls start pelting VICKI.)

NARRATOR
Omigod! She's been hit! And from what I can see, quite badly! Her eyeliner's running down the street!


( Footsteps. VICKI slumps into DINETTE's arms, who starts to carry her offstage when we hear footsteps running closer. Flashlight on lovers.)

RANGER
There she is! Bag that she-devil! Don't let that varmint escape! Somebody call an ambulance!


(DINETTE drops VICKI and exits.)

NARRATOR
Yes, yes, of course.

( Dialing sounds.)

Is there a doctor in the house?


(DOCTOR enters from audience.)

DOCTOR
Here I am.

NARRATOR
You're too young to be a doctor!

DOCTOR
I'm a resident. I can do anything a real doctor can do except play mixed doubles. Bring her to my office!



NARRATOR
And so an ambulance bears Vicki away.


( Blackout.)

NARRATOR
At the hospital a dedicated team of professionals try to work Vicki in.


( Lights up in hospital. DOCTOR and VICKI with NURSE, who is BABS, acting very bored.)

BABS
No appointment, well dear … Ah, you're in luck! A cancellation!

DOCTOR
We're here to help you. But you must try to help yourself. Any small detail you can recall is important. Concentrate, how did you get from the nightclub to the mountains?

VICKI
I don't remember.

DOCTOR
What did you do there?

VICKI
I don't remember.

DOCTOR
Who were you with?

VICKI
( hesitates)

: I don't know …

DOCTOR
Are you sure?

VICKI
Yes, I'm quite sure. I've just had a terrible shock, you know.

DOCTOR
Yes, kidnapping and loss of memory are terrible, indeed, but nothing compared to the shock you'll get when you pay the bill. Now, dear, I just want you to relax and try to forget this nasty amnesia. That's right! Relax and try to breathe normally. Nurse, will you fix a cup of coffee to calm down the patient.



NURSE
Certainly, doctor. All right honey, how do you like it?

VICKI
I don't remember. Oh, doctor, doctor, it's terrible!

DOCTOR
Vicki, what is it?

VICKI
All I can remember is that I left my clothes at the laundry and lost the ticket. Now I don't remember what the bag looked like. Gone, all gone, my favorite socks, everything I ever loved … gone!

DOCTOR
Just relax and watch this crystal. You have box seats at a Ping-Pong tournament. Your eyes never leave the ball. You are getting sleepy, sleepy, sleepy ….

(DOCTOR falls asleep and starts snoring.)

BABS
Doctor, wake up.

DOCTOR
Ah, Vicki, what do you remember?

VICKI
It's no good, my mind's a blank ….

DOCTOR
Yes, we know that.

( To NURSE:)

I'm confident I can restore the patient's true identity.

BABS
You can, but why?

DOCTOR
Prepare 28cc of phenobarbothanx.

NURSE
Phenobarbothanx … pheno, as an antibiotic?

DOCTOR
Right.



NURSE
And barbo … as a sedative?

DOCTOR
Right.

NURSE
And thanx?

DOCTOR
And thanx for the memories!


( Organ stab.)

NARRATOR
Can the doctor restore Vicki's true identity? Can anyone save Vicki from the vegetable patch? Can … wait a minute. Haven't I seen that nurse before …? That's no nurse, that's her! Omigod! It's the proverbial hat-check girl in white-collar clothing. Tune in next week for the startling conclusion of the Well

VICKI
Listen, sister …

NARRATOR
—really talk to each other.

VICKI
A little piece of advice: you could be put on pre-recorded tape.

NARRATOR
This is the play women who love women have been waiting to see!

BABS
Can that chowder! Who wants to see an uptight WASP from the Midwest stumble around in a polyester dress? I'm the one they come to see.

THE ACTRESS WHO PLAYED GEORGETTE
Who's gonna see you on the radio?

NARRATOR
A collaborative effort—

BABS
This is my big moment! I got my teeth capped for this part!

NARRATOR
Unlike traditional theater …

ROD
Hey, hey, girls, come on—remember, there are no small parts—

MCCLIT
There are only small minds, Rod.

BABS
You should know, you've got one of the smallest!

NARRATOR
A proverbial filling up and spilling over of sapphic sentiment!

VICKI
Good things come in small actresses!

BABS
Tell me about it, I came in several small actresses.

NARRATOR
Yes, ladies and genders, our show is another fine example of women working together.

THE ACTRESS WHO PLAYED GEORGETTE
Where's my lipstick! Which one of you took my lipstick!.

NARRATOR
A testimonial to Womeen's love for one another!

BABS
I wouldn't touch anything of yours!

NARRATOR
Of their ability to surmount the limitations of their own egos, to work collectively!

BABS
I'm the star! I'm the star! I'm the star!

NARRATOR
In this, our final episode—

ROD
Thank God, I can't take another minute with these dizzy dames.

NARRATOR
-we find Vicki

( sound of panting, shoes running)

on the lam, in the picturesque Catatonic Mountains. She seems hopelessly lost—

ROD
Well, if it's hopeless I say let's just put on the laugh track and break out some brews!

NARRATOR
I said seems hopelessly lost, Rod.

ROD
Just checking there, buddy.

BABS
She's hopeless, all right.

VICKI
Now just a minute, Babs, you two-bit thespian!

BABS
Who are you calling a thespian? I'm a normal woman! I'm no introvert—not like the rest of you.

NARRATOR
Vicki is wandering in a daze.


( Sound of golf course up.)

VICKI
A daze! Oh, don't you think I should wear something that shows off my figure?

BABS
Not unless you're wearing a cast-iron girdle under it!

NARRATOR
We last saw Vicki, prostrate on a Lazy Boy

(VICKI snores)

about to get an injection to restore her memory.

BABS
Shall I call you at the hospital, Doctor?

DOCTOR
Why? I'll be at the golf course. I thought I could get in nine holes before "The Cosby Show."

NARRATOR
As the doctor exits, the nurse readies the needle … wait a minute—that's no nurse, that's her.

(BABS steps forward to acknowledge the hissing from the rest of the cast that increasingly greets her villainous appearances. She loves it.)

NARRATOR
Poor Vicki, nobody is there to hold her hand as she gets the prick. What's really in the needle? A regular Florence Nightshade, aren't we, Babs? And how did you penetrate the brotherhood of healing?

BABS
I'm a Kelly girl!

NARRATOR
Babs administers the heinous hypo, only to send Vicki down

DOWN

DOWN

( organ stab)

DOWN, into the Well

( scream)

of Horniness. Can nothing stop the testy temp worker? She callously climbs over Vicki

( sound of Babs grunting with physical effort)

who was as limp as a closet case on her wedding night. Babs begins dialing ….


( Dialing phone.)

BABS
Hello, I'd like to speak to Police Chief Al Dente …. No? Well, give him a message …. Tell him he can pick up that touch typist he's been trailing.


( Sound of phone hanging up. Blackout.)




( Lights up on Police Office.)

NARRATOR
Meanwhile, down at headquarters, Al Dente was feeling very excited. The feds had been on the case for weeks. Finally, after combing the area, they had turned up something.

OFFICER
( holds up a ratty-looking wig)

: Looks like human hair, Chief.

DENTE
Yes it does, but that's the beauty of dynel, my boy.

NARRATOR
Just as he thought, the word-processor had wigged out and run. The chief had seen it a million times before: when the chips were down, the chicks left town. They just couldn't take the heat, and if the heat didn't get them, it was the humidity. The chief was getting pretty steamed up himself.

DENTE
I'd have the supper-club sniper in the slammer if it wasn't for stupidity.

OFFICER
Sorry, Chief, I …

DENTE
My stupidity. I should have never assigned the androgyne to the case.

OFFICER
You mean Garnet?

DENTE
Sending her out by herself to sniff out a girl was like sending a blind man out without a cane.

OFFICER
I don't get it, Chief—

DENTE
They'd both disappear into the first manhole they'd uncover.

OFFICER
I still don't get it.

DENTE
That's the last tribad on the force, you hear me? They've got no ambition.

OFFICER
But Garnet seemed like such an eager beaver.

DENTE
Even on the ballfield—they don't care if they live or die in the bush leagues.

OFFICER
Chief, I got something on my mind.

DENTE
So spit it out.

OFFICER
( spits)

: I can't help but think, well …

DENTE
Well?

OFFICER
Well, maybe you're wrong about Vicki.

DENTE
Phooey.

OFFICER
I think she's innocent.

DENTE
If she's innocent, I'll eat her.

OFFICER
But Chief, YECH!

DENTE
You want me to believe the femme was framed? And not only framed, but fingered? But by who?


( Organ stab.)

NARRATOR
And how many?


( Organ stab. Phone rings.)

DENTE
( picking up the phone)

: Police morgue. You stab it, we slab it. Is this a takeout or a delivery?

CALLER
I gotta little massage for Garnet McClit.

DENTE
What?

CALLER
Tell her I got her clues, she can pick 'em up anytime.


( Dial tone and organ stab. GARNET's theme up.)

NARRATOR
The cryptic call sheds no light on the case at hand. But it did remind the Chief that the lady dick had not been spotted since the last commercial. While the Chief mused, Garnet was still struggling to regain consciousness. Bab's blow had taken the edge off the sapphic sleuth's ordinarily sharp senses. Even the simplest thing—standing up—seemed as difficult as putting on a girdle under water.

( Gurgle and snap.)

Garnet didn't know who or what had hit her. And what of the mysterious woman she had met? Now, she was a knockout, thought the leggy gumshoe as she stumbled home.

( Key in door.)

The detective declined to disrobe but immediately fell into a stupor.

( Thud.)

It wasn't as comfortable as a futon, but it was about all she could afford on her salary.

(GARNET lights a cigarette.)

As for the case, it went on the back burner. But in the morning

( rooster)

all Garnet's theories were still half-baked. She'd have to scrape something together for the Chief.

(GARNET's theme out.)

While we wait for the punchline, Rod is back at the ranch-style poring over some new carpet commercials.

( Water pouring.)




( Ding-Dong!)

BABS
Avon calling!

NARRATOR
But when he opened the door … This was no saleslady.

ROD
Hey, hey!

NARRATOR
From her careless capri pants to her skimpy halter top, Rod's eyes swept over her hills and valleys like two pilots on a search-and-destroy mission, missing only one thing:

( organ stab)

the Redhead was packing a rod!

( Trigger clicks.)

BABS
Okay, Mr˙ Carpet King, don't try anything funny. Not that that's a danger in this show. I'll make a sister outta you real fast!


( Hospital ambience music.)

NARRATOR
Back at the hospital, a bevy of blonds arrive to frisk our friend Vicki.

BLOND A
A: The chief said they're gonna pin this caper on you.

VICKI
What! And leave a mark in my dress? Just let him try ….

BLOND B
He said to find something …

BLOND A
Anything …

BLOND B
And make it stick ….


( Organ.)

NARRATOR
Vicki was almost at the breaking point. She had been pursued all over the state, from hotel to motel. She had lost her curling iron and was— gasp—almost out of Sweet 'N Low. Would this torture never end? Once again she called out to the heavens …


( Dialing, ringing, recording up.)

ROD
Hi! Thanks for calling. I'm not able to come to the phone right now, but leave your name, number, and religious persuasion after the beep and I'll get back to you.

( BEEP!)

NARRATOR
Then she heard the most vicious vixen bark out:

BLOND A
Spread 'em, sister!

NARRATOR
The command seemed strangely familiar to Vicki. As she complied she thought …

VICKI
PRISON!!

NARRATOR
She would have prayed for amnesia, but she didn't know if her insurance would cover a relapse. In desperation, she thought of England. But that was worse than prison!

VICKI
At least in prison they had central heating and decent coffee!

NARRATOR
She felt a hand run the length of her leg.

( Feet running.)

VICKI
Find anything you like?

BLOND B
Just browsing.

VICKI
Well, if you don't see it, just ask for it. Maybe I have it in the back.

BLOND A
She's clean.

VICKI
Maybe you should get a second opinion.


( Hospital out.)




( Car doors opening, slamming; typing. Police office up.)

NARRATOR
Vicki is escorted downtown for the arraignment while Al Dente waits for Rod and Garnet. There has been no answer at Rod's residence.


( Ringing phone.)

DENTE
Maybe he's on his way. Or maybe he just got tied up.

( Ominous organ stab.)

MCCLIT
Whatsa scoop, Chief?

DENTE
I got the housewife on the hotseat.

MCCLIT
So why the long face?

DENTE
It's not that I care about that crummy little clerical worker. The broad's a brat. But Rod is my buddy.

NARRATOR
At the mention of his friend's name, the chief was choked with feeling.


( Gagging.)

MCCLIT
( on reverb or voice over)

: This must be that male bonding I've heard so much about.


( Office sound effects fade to courtroom ambience.)

NARRATOR
For his friend's sake, Al decides to spare Rod and spoil the child, Vicki.

JUDGE
Order! Order in the court!


( Various voices are heard ordering: "BLT!" "Two eggs whole wheat toast!" "Whiskey down!" "More Fire!" "Russian dressing!" ad nauseam.)

JUDGE
Okay, Vicki, let's make a deal!

( Game show theme music up.)

Do you want the sentence I just offered you? Or will you take the cell Carol Merrill is standing in front of? Or how about I give you five bucks for the phone number of every woman you ever slept with?

NARRATOR
Vicki passes up the chair, the sofa bed, and the Judge's generous offer of amnesty in exchange for a date, in order to take an all-expense-paid trip for one

( cheers and applause)

UP THE RIVER!

( Groans.)




( Cell door closing.)




( Jail ambience up.)

BABS
No more word-processing for you, honey! It's license plates from now on!

( Cackle, cackle.)

NARRATOR
Can Vicki survive her stint in the slammer?

( Organ keys.)

Is it the end of the line for this lezzie?

( Organ keys.)

We'll find out after this word from our sponsor!


( Disco music up.)

ROD
It's Saturday night in hipcity and you're a loose woman on the loose—you want to move and groove to the latest beat, you want to go

( singing)

"Where the boys …" Aren't!

BABS
That's where we'll be!

ROD
If you're like us.

BABS
And we know you are or you wouldn't be listening.

ROD
You want to cut the rug at your favorite Amazon watering hole. And in this town, a town like many others, the place to go for girls is … the Vixen's Den! And this month … we're having a sale! We've slashed our already low, low prices on wine, women and song!

MCCLIT
That's right, the girls are really coming out for this one!

ROD
We want you to come and come again! So hurry on down to the Vixen's Den, right off Route 17 in this town, a town like many others!

BABS
Oh, and tell 'em Babs sent ya.


( Disco music out.)

NARRATOR
Vicki was very upset. She didn't realize the prison uniforms would have horizontal stripes!

VICKI
Oh God, I'm all hips!

INMATE A
Oh, yoo-hoo.

INMATE B
How ya doing, Goldilocks?

INMATE A
( in a stage whisper)

: We haven't had a blond in a while.

VICKI
Oh, hello, I'm sorry I'm … I've never been behind bars before.

INMATE C
Whatsa matter, don't you drink?

INMATE A
Don't mind her, my little turnover.

INMATE B
Whatcha get sent up for anyway? Mugging an Avon lady?

INMATE C
Scratch somebody's eyes out at the sale table?

INMATE A
( in mock sympathy)

: Shoplifting at Bonwit's again, tsk, tsk.

INMATE C
Ah, let up girls, she's taking it kinda hard.

INMATE B
( lecherously)

: That's not all she's gonna be taking kinda hard when we get through with her.

INMATE A
Relax, Goldilocks …

INMATE C
We're just tyring—

INMATE A
—to make you—

INMATE B
—feel—

INMATE A
—welcome. Right, girls?


( Unison sounds of affirmation.)

INMATE B
We wish we could make you feel really welcome, but they locked the broom closet.

INMATE A
Shush, you gotta give her something to look forward to …

NARRATOR
In desperation, Vicki buries her head in her skirt.

( Mumbling from VICKI.)

INMATE C
You might as well get used to it.

INMATE B
Goldiwet.

INMATE C
Honeydung.

INMATE B
Little Miss Pussytwat. You're one of us now.

INMATE A
After all—

INMATE C
—we're all—

INMATE A
—sisters—

INMATE B
—under the skin, aren't we, girls?

INMATE C
You could learn to like it …

INMATE A
We could teach you …

NARRATOR
Vicki began to wail.

INMATE B
Come on, save the wails.

INMATE C
Oh, go on and scream. It'll break the monotony.

VICKI
Let me out! I'm not supposed to be in jail! I'm white and I can work if I have to!

INMATE B
Oh, leaving so soon? Tsk, tsk, don't let us keep you.

VICKI
I don't belong here! This must be a misprint, a typo, I don't like this anymore! And you … all of you … I don't like you either!

INMATE A
Ouch!

INMATE B
Ooh! She really knows how to hurt a girl!

INMATE A
Come to think of it, you may be right.

INMATE C
Maybe you don't like us, —

INMATE B
—but—

INMATE C
—you are like us—

INMATE B
—dearie.

INMATE A
And you do belong here with us.

NARRATOR
Vicki knew they were baiting her. But she didn't go for it.

VICKI
No thanks, I ate a heavy lunch.


( Blackout. Organ.)

INMATE A
What happened?

INMATE B
Who turned out the lights?

INMATE C
Damn it all, I told you if you put too many vibrators in one socket this'll happen every time.


( Organ. Lights up. GARNET theme up.)

NARRATOR
While Vicki had been incarcerated, Garnet was at home piecing together the evidence until she got a clear picture of the villainess … Babs!


( Hiss. Sound of car.)

MCCLIT
I gotta get to the bottom of this.


( Car speeds up.)

NARRATOR
Immediately she rushed to the prison, the crime of the scene. Little did our gamey gumshoe know there was no bottom to the Well

( scream)

of Horniness!

( Organ to prison sounds.)

During all the confusion, Garnet entered the prison and grabbed Vicki in the dark.

VICKI
That's not the dark.

MCCLIT
And you're not a real blond.

VICKI
Bye, girls, hee hee.

INMATE B
Don't kid yourself, honey, there's no bi-girls here.

INMATE A
You'll be back, too—

INMATE C
—Goldilocks.

INMATE B
Sooner than you—

INMATE A
—think.

MCCLIT
Come on, let's make tracks.

VICKI
But won't that make it easier for them to follow us?

MCCLIT
Good point. We'll go in my car.


( Car doors open/close—running car.)

NARRATOR
Vicki instinctively put her trust in Garnet. But she was taken aback by the brunette's casual attitude.

VICKI
Darn, I shoulda asked for a receipt.

NARRATOR
Her fate was in Garnet's hands.

VICKI
That isn't all I've thought of putting in Garnet's hands.

NARRATOR
But for now, Vicki was content. She hated sex in cars.

VICKI
It reminds me of an unhappy affair I had with a geologist that left me between a rock and a hard place.

NARRATOR
Garnet, a dyed-in-the-wool tribad from the word come, studied her companion. Vicki was just her type. Garnet, cursed with the kind of carnal appetite that no single girl could satisfy, had, in desperation, turned to married women.

MCCLIT
This Vicki is made of pretty tough stuff.

NARRATOR
All this running around could ruin a girl's hairdo.

MCCLIT
But not hers, no sir. No listless locks on this lezzie.

NARRATOR
When did that busy, busy gal, our heroine, find the time to tend her tresses?


( Organ stab.)

NARRATOR
Finally, Garnet could not stand the silent meeting of the mutual admiration society.

VICKI
They have me convicted already.

MCCLIT
You've been holding up fine so far. I know it's been a lengthy exposition and you're tired. But don't go to pieces on me now.

VICKI
I can't help it. I can't go on much longer like this. You don't know what it's like, always on the go. Living outta a suitcase. If I don't get a chance to go to bed soon, I don't know what will become of me … or the show. But you probably don't understand. You're not a blond.

MCCLIT
No, I'm a brunette, but I have feelings, too.


( Car swerves to roadside.)

VICKI
What's the matter? Why are we slowing down? Are we out of material?

NARRATOR
Vicki's eyes met Garnet's. Their gazes locked.

( Click.)

VICKI
Garnet … I … I'm a wanted woman in seven states.

MCCLIT
Make it eight, baby. You're wanted by me in the state I'm in.

NARRATOR
For too long the lady dick had been tortured by the woman sitting next to her …. But the sight of her breasts jiggling—her thighs whispering together—was too much. Garnet traced the outline of Vicki's body with her lips. Vicki's passion stirred. Something in her oven of love began to rise. She threw her head back on the car seat. She felt just like a pair of French doors awaiting Loretta Young's entrance.

( Radio being tuned.)

Garnet played Vicki as expertly as a teenager plays a transistor. When she felt she had had some pretty good reception, Garnet moved in on some fine tuning.

( Radio: "One Adam 12, One Adam 12, come in please.")

A call from the car radio mangles the mood.

MCCLIT
Roger, I read you.

DISPATCHER
Roger's off tonight. It's Friday.

MCCLIT
Right, Whatsa scoop?

DISPATCHER
We have a 411 underway at the carpet warehouse off Route 17.

VICKI
Rod!


( Car moves off.)

NARRATOR
As Garnet and Vicki speed to the scene of the crime …

( Organ.)

Omigod, that's no radio dispatcher ….

( Organ.)

That's her….

( Organ. Hiss.)

You Kelly girls really get around, don't you? And what have you done with Rod?

(ROD gagged and mumbling. BABS laughs.)

Bound and gagged in his own office! And why drag our heroine into this wholesale horror?

( Organ.)

BABS
Well, you wanted to see her again, didn't you? Better make it a good look, because it'll be your last.

( Hiss.)




( Door creaks open. Echoed footsteps.)

NARRATOR
Garnet and Vicki enter the warehouse …

VICKI
It's kinda quiet in here for a shootout, doncha think?

MCCLIT
Vicki, a cop doesn't think in a crisis.

BABS
Hold it right there! If it isn't Van Dyke and Van Dick! Well, well, Garnet, we meet again. What took you so long?

MCCLIT
Search me.

BABS
An excellent suggestion, sucker. We'll start with Ms˙ Twinkie Tits over here.

MCCLIT
Babs!

VICKI
Is there something funny about my breasts, honey?

MCCLIT
Not a thing, dear …. Now see here, this is no way to treat a lady. Where are your manners?

BABS
This is no comedy of manners, dick, despite rumors to the contrary. This is just business as usual for tribads.


( Organ; mumbling sounds from Rod.)

VICKI
Rod! Here I am!


( Dream music starts.)

BABS
You can't go back to him, sister. If it was him you wanted, you shoulda figured that out a long time ago.


( Gunshot.)




(BABS laughs.)




( Dream music up.)

ROD
Honey, Vick, it's just a bad dream, wake up. You're with me now, you're safe.

VICKI
I can go back! I will! You'll see … I'm gonna be a good wife!

ROD
Wake up. Of course you'll be the best little wifeypoo a man could ever want.

VICKI
Rod! Omigod … You're not tied up …

ROD
Right you are. I got the night off so I could take you out to dinner. You musta dozed off while I was on the phone.

VICKI
But … I … was …

ROD
Honey, you were dreaming.

VICKI
But everything seemed so real.

ROD
You know how dreams are. But darling, I'll tell you what's real … you and I …. Why don't you freshen up while I go start the car?


( Music up.)

NARRATOR
As carrots in the Cuisinart so are the souls in the Well

( scream)

of Horniness. Goodnight and have a nice life.
