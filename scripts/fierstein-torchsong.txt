ARNOLD
Damned Elmer's glue! Just let me finish emasculating this eye and I'll be right with you. (Fixes it. Poses in the mirror.)
HERE
Discusses his wonderful relationship with his mother. B
AND THERE
Married, "Just in for the Weekend," and terminally ill. Those affairs are the worst. You go into them with
ED
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I was just trying to duck that pool cue. Gets pretty crowded in here on a Saturday. Your foot okay? Good. (He turns away, but then can't help sneaking a look at the stranger. He smiles and turns away embarrassed, then turns to him again.) No permanent damage, I hope. To your foot I mean. . . . Good. (He turns away again, but still tries to sneak a look behind him. He gathers his courage and confronts the stranger with a huge smile.) Look, the name's Ed Reiss. My friends call me Ed. (No response) I'm Sagittarius. . . . What's so funny? . . . Oh, well, some people like to know that stuff. I don't believe in any of it myself, but I have done some reading about it. See, I like to know what's expected of me. (He stares with a huge grin.) You have a beautiful smile. . . . No, really, you do. Can I get you another beer?
ED
Oh, wow. Your place is really great.
ARNOLD
I'm glad you like it.
ED
No, it's really fabulous. But, would you mind putting on a light?
ARNOLD
There's not much to see.
ED
There's you.
ARNOLD
Better?
ED
Better . . . and better. You're shaking.
ARNOLD
Nervous, I guess.
ED
Me, too.
ARNOLD
Really?
ED
Really.
ARNOLD
I'm glad you asked me home.
ED
Me too.
ARNOLD
Ed?
ED
Yeah?
ARNOLD
I feel... I don't know . . . kinda scared.
ED
Better?
ARNOLD
Better . . . and better.
ARNOLD
"Having completed the hexagram, compare it to the chart on page 228." (He flips to the chart and compares his scratch-ings to it.) Here it is. Number thirty-eight. (He searches excitedly for the right page. He finds it.) Here we go. "Hexagram Thirty-eight, Koo-eee-iiiii. The Estranged."
ARNOLD
Goddammit, Murray, what took you so long? . . . The shower could have waited, Murray. . . . The shampoo in the shower could have waited, Murray. . . . The man with the shampoo in the shower could have waited, Murray. Anyway, I can't talk now. I gotta keep the line free. (Starting to hang up) What? . . . I just wanted to make sure the phone was working. . . . Ed. All right? I'm expecting a call from Ed. . . . When? Well, it is now Tuesday, eight p.m. Well, Ed's gonna call sometime after Tuesday eight p.m. . . . Of course he's gonna call, Murray. You think I'd sit by the phone for six days if he wasn't gonna call? . . . You are getting on my nerves, Murray. Look, he is a very busy man. With a great many responsibilities. He will call me when he is able. And I will understand. Got it? When you have been seeing someone
ED
Hello?
ARNOLD
Hi. Was that you?
ED
Oh, hi. Was what me?
ARNOLD
Just now on the phone. Was that you trying to get me?
ED
No.
ARNOLD
Oh. Then I wonder who it was. See, I just walked in this second. (Nonstop) You know, I've been out of town all week. And I was fumbling at the door with my luggage and the keys when I heard the phone ringing, so of course I dropped the keys, and when I bent over to pick up the keys I dropped the luggage, so of course since I was nervous and the phone was ringing one of the cases uncaught and opened up and everything fell out all over the place. So, finally I got the door open and kicked everything inside, dove at the phone,
ED
I was going to call you real soon. I've just been really busy.
ARNOLD
What's the difference, we're talking now. By the way, you remember that Helen Morgan record I played last time you were here? Well, I was able to find another copy in a little secondhand shop uptown. It's almost like new. So I picked it up for you.
ED
Thanks.
ARNOLD
You're welcome.
ED
Look, Arnold, I can't talk right now. I've got a friend coming over for dinner and uh . . .
ARNOLD
That's okay. I just called 'cause I thought it was you calling. So, give me a call when you're not so busy.
ED
I'm sorry. I'll call you tomorrow.
ARNOLD
Hey, no problem. I understand.
ED
What do you understand? You never give me a chance to call you. Every time I'm just about to, there you are calling me.
ARNOLD
ESP maybe? (No response) Well, just think of all the money I save you on phone calls.
ED
You're impossible. You know that?
ARNOLD
Yeah. It's a wonder you put up with me.
ED
So, how was your trip?
ARNOLD
My trip? Oh, my trip. Okay. Who's coming over for dinner.
ED
A friend. You don't know him.
ARNOLD
How do you know? I know lots of hymns
ED
You are impossible.
ARNOLD
So, is it an old him or a new him?
ED
Why do you do this to yourself?
ARNOLD
I'm just asking. Can't a person show a little interest in another person's life? (Pause) So?
ED
A new one.
ARNOLD
Aha. Where'd you meet him? The Stud?
ED
I've really got to go now, Arnold. I'll call you soon, all right?
ARNOLD
That's what you said last week.
ED
Well, maybe if you waited and gave me a chance to call. . .
ARNOLD
That's all I'm asking you for
ED
Arnold, I don't want a scene on the phone. I'll call you tomorrow and we'll get together and talk.
ARNOLD
What's wrong? Until last week, I could've sworn things were going great for both of us. What's happening?
ED
Not now, Arnold.
ARNOLD
Yes. Now.
ED
Arnold, I'm just going to get angry.
ARNOLD
So get angry! Just talk to me! (Silence) Hello? Are you there?
ED
I'm here.
ARNOLD
I miss you. (Pause) I think about you all the time. (Pause) I'm so damned horny.
ED
You need a job.
ARNOLD
I've got a job. I need a lover.
ED
Well, I don't. There. Is that what you wanted to hear?
ARNOLD
No. But it's a beginning. What do you need?
ED
A friend. I've said that all along. If you'd listen sometimes instead of. . .
ARNOLD
You've got a friend. And a lover too. All in one neat package. That's modern efficiency at work.
ED
It is not what I need.
ARNOLD
How do you know? Maybe it is. You'll never be sure unless you give it a try.
ED
I have tried, Arnold.
ARNOLD
No you haven't! (Softer) You haven't. I wish to God you had, but you haven't.
ED
Arnold, this is not going to do any good for either one of us.
ARNOLD
What makes you so sure of what's good and what's not? Maybe it's just what we need. Maybe it's just what / need. You can't expect me to just sit around here waiting for you to call.
ED
I never asked you to. I told you to go out, have a good time, meet other people . . .
ARNOLD
I can't, all right? I'm not built that way.
ED
Well, I'm just not ready to make that kind of a commitment.
ARNOLD
I'm not asking you to. But if I have to accept you going out, then you have to accept that I'm not.
ED
You really are crazy.
ARNOLD
I'm lonely.
ED
That's not my fault.
ARNOLD
Wanna bet?
ED
You've got no right to make me feel guilty.
ARNOLD
I happen to be in love with you. That must give me some kind of rights. And if that don't give me the right to see you, then at least I got the right to bitch about it. (Long silence) You said that you loved me. You do remember telling me that, don't you?
ED
Yes.
ARNOLD
Then, do you or don't you?
ED
You know how I feel about you.
ARNOLD
I don't. I wouldn't ask if I did.
ED
Yes. I love you.
ARNOLD
Then what's going on?
ED
What do you want me to say?
ARNOLD
I want you to say what's on your mind. That's what I want. I want you to tell me how in two short weeks we have gone from being lovers to whatever the hell you'd call this?
ED
You are being very difficult.
ARNOLD
You are being very difficult. (Hard) Talk to me, goddammit! (Silence) Is it your parents coming North? Is that it? Are you ashamed of me?
ED
Of course not.
ARNOLD
Then what?
ED
Not on the phone. What if I come over straight from school tomorrow?
ARNOLD
No! I've got to hear it now. I know what'll happen if you come over, everything will be great just like it always is
ED
Arnold, I really cannot talk to you now. She'll be here any minute. I'll see you after work tomorrow, okay? (No response) Arnold? Hello?
ARNOLD
She? Did you say SHE?
ED
Shit.
ARNOLD
Oh, "Shit"! Thank God. For a minute I thought you said "She."
ED
I did say she. I am seeing a woman.
ARNOLD
And you called me crazy!
ED
Now you know why I didn't want to discuss it on the phone.
ARNOLD
Oh, sure. I can see how much more understandable it would be discussed calmly over a postsexual cigarette. (Long pause) It is your parents.
ED
No, it isn't!
ARNOLD
Then why all of a sudden like this?
ED
It's not all of a sudden. I just happened to meet her now, that's all. Don't make believe I never told you about my relationships with women.
ARNOLD
Sure, you told me about your woman relations. But I thought you meant sisters and aunts and nieces.
ED
That's not funny.
ARNOLD
I think it's hysterical. (Long pause. He tries to remain calm.) So . . . how long has this been going on?
ED
Not long.
ARNOLD
How'd you meet her?
ED
My friends Bob and Janet asked me if I was seeing anyone because they knew this girl they thought I might like to meet.
ARNOLD
And what did you say when they asked if you were seeing anyone?
ED
I said that I wasn't. (Guilty pause) Well, I could hardly tell them about you, could I?
ARNOLD
God forbid!
ED
What are you thinking?
ARNOLD
I am thinking about how it feels to be a no one in the life of someone you love. (Pause) Tell me about her.
ED
Why don't you call me a bastard and hang up?
ARNOLD
I want to understand. Talk to me.
ED
I can't. . .
ARNOLD
Please.
ED
Well, she's wonderful.
ARNOLD
Bastard!
ED
You asked!
ARNOLD
I did, didn't I. It's the masochist in me. What'd you tell her about me?
ED
Nothing.
ARNOLD
That does seem to be my name. You did tell her you were bisexual, didn't you?
ED
No. I didn't think it was important.
ARNOLD
Of course not. How silly of me to even mention it.
ED
I'm not so sure that some secrets aren't better kept that way.
ARNOLD
You don't feel that's just slightly dishonest?
ED
No. We have a more mature relationship than that.
ARNOLD
Pardon my naivete. I didn't know that there really was
ED
This weekend.
ARNOLD
I don't believe a word of this. And you're still going to tell me that they have nothing to do with this sudden burst of heterosexuality? (No response) Look, Ed, I don't know much about the straight world, but I do know that when a guy takes a gal to meet his folks, for the weekend no less, that this is no casual affair. (No response) Don't you feel you're being unfair to lead her on that way? (Not to mention what you're doing to me.) (No response) Don't you think she has a right to know what she's letting herself in for? (No response) What's the matter? Catch your tongue in the closet door?
ED
You're really dragging me over the coals.
ARNOLD
Why should I be the only one with a barbecued ass? If I may ask another stupid question
ED
That's up to you.
ARNOLD
Not entirely.
ED
I had hoped that we could go on seeing each other. You may not believe this, but I really don't want to lose you.
ARNOLD
That's hitting below the belt; appealing to my Susan Hayward fantasies. . . . "Arnold, Back Street Woman"!
ED
That's not the way it is at all!
ARNOLD
Then take me to meet your parents.
ED
I could if I wanted to. They'd understand.
ARNOLD
Oh, I know they'd understand. It's you that can't. At least you didn't lie when you said you weren't scared for them to meet me. You're scared they'll meet you!
ED
Thank you very much. Your kindness is appreciated.
ARNOLD
Listen, Mr. Reiss. At this moment I don't think you
ED
You helpless?
ARNOLD
Dumb, huh? (Cracking) I don't understand. I thought... we were so happy. That we were so special. The way we made love . . . the way you cried in my arms. . . . You said you loved me. . . .
ED
I do. I always will.
ARNOLD
Then what are we doing?
ED
I don't know. I'm confused . . . I'm frightened.
ARNOLD
Ed, come over.
ED
No, I can't. I have made up my mind. I know what I want. I'm doing what I have to do. I know that you are hurting, but that is my decision.
ARNOLD
You can't see what you're doing.
ED
Yes I can. I'm not like you, Arnold. I can't be happy living in a ghetto of gay bars and gay restaurants and backrooms, scared that someone will find out that I'm gay and maybe get me fired. I hate those queens with their bitchy remarks and Bette Davis imitations. I don't want any part of that.
ARNOLD
But that's not us. . . .
ED
I want more. I've got to be proud of who I am.
ARNOLD
How can sleeping with a woman make you proud of yourself if you know you'd rather be with a man? How can you ever get any respect from anyone if you won't be yourself? There's no you to respect!
ED
And just where's your self-respect? Huh? I certainly don't see any here!
ARNOLD
You wanna see my self-respect? Here's my self-respect! (He slams down the receiver as the light blacks out on Ed. Then . . . calmer.) I fell right into that one.
SCENE FOUR
ARNOLD
ARNOLD
Look, Murray, I am not that lonely! This here's as far as I go. My standards may lie just left of reactionary, but my limit in a backroom bar is the front room. Maybe I just better go home, huh? Thank you for taking me out but. . .
OKAY
quick mind, sharp wit, glowing personality. But, Murray, what if I don't glow in the dark?
ARNOLD
Careful, some of that might rub off on you.
ED
You scared me. (Holding out his arms) Hello, Arnold.
ARNOLD
Hello.
ED
Bet you thought you'd never see me again. (Pause) You look fantastic.
ARNOLD
Well, aren't you a deah to say so!
ED
The stage manager said it'd be all right for me to wait for you in your dressing room. You don't mind, do you? (No response. Arnold sits and begins to peel his face off.) When I asked for you as Arnold he didn't know who I meant. (A little laugh) You look beautiful . . . really. Lost a little weight, I see. (He reaches out to touch Arnold.)
ARNOLD
Please . . .
ED
Sorry. I guess you're still pretty angry, huh?
ARNOLD
No, I'm not still angry. This is brand-new. What are you doing here?
ED
I wanted to see you. I've been worried about you. (Arnold shoots him a look.) I wanted to make sure that you were all right.
ARNOLD
How'd you know I was here?
ED
I saw an ad in the paper.
ARNOLD
That ad should have satisfied your curiosity.
ED
I had planned on seeing the show and just leaving, but when I saw you onstage I had to come back and talk to you. (Pause) Been a long time.
ARNOLD
Five months ago you checked out on me with a single phone call. You said that you knew what you wanted and that I wasn't it. I haven't heard a word from you since. What do you want?
ED
Just to see you.
ARNOLD
You've seen me. Get out.
ED
Arnold, please. I'd like to talk to you.
ARNOLD
No.
ED
Wait, just listen to me for a minute.
ARNOLD
NO!
ED
It's got nothing to do with us . . .
ARNOLD
I said no, goddammit! Now, just go and leave me alone. (Softer) The one nice thing I could say about you was when you left, you left. No matter what I thought of your reasons or lack of them, you kept your word. . . .
ED
You knew I'd come back to see you. I told you that I wanted us to be friends. You mean a lot to me. (Pause. He makes the "I love you" sign and holds it up.) Arnold? . . .
ARNOLD
Don't get cute with me.
ED
Maybe I shouldn't have come here, but as long as the harm's done can't I talk to you? Just until you're dressed? It's important to me.
ARNOLD
Sit down.
ED
So, how you been?
ARNOLD
Can we somehow manage to skip the little niceties and get right to the meat. I know you're here for something.
ED
There is something I have to tell you, but give me a little time. It's not the kind of thing I can blurt right out.
ARNOLD
How are your folks?
ED
They're fine. My father had a little trouble with an inner ear infection, but it cleared up nicely.
ARNOLD
They go back South for the winter?
ED
They left two days ago.
ARNOLD
Two days?! What took you so long?
ED
What?
ARNOLD
Ed, you can forget it. It's over. You are not coming back.
ED
You don't understand . . .
ARNOLD
I have never done time in the closet and I sure as hell ain't gettin' in one for you.
ED
But, I don't want to come back. (Arnold stares.) Really. Things are going great with Laurel. I tried to tell you. I came to talk to you as a friend. (Arnold turns back to the mirror. Ed continues merrily.) We spent a really fantastic summer upstate. We stayed at my parents' place in Florida for a week, then back up to the farm. I got a lot done on the house, including a new chimney.
ARNOLD
And what'd you do with what's-her-face?
ED
Laurel. Well, at first things were sort of strained. She'd hang around me all the time wanting us to work together. But I talked to her and finally she began doing things on her own. It was hard for her to understand. She doesn't take criticism very well. She tenses up and gets very quiet. Mid-August my sister sent her two kids up for a few days and Laurel took care
ARNOLD
Sounds wonderful! Pa out in the fields, Ma tendin' the young'uns, Grandma and Grandpa rockin' on the porch. I'm just sorry you and Laurel couldn't have spent the summer together.
ED
You should have seen how Laurel cried when the kids left. But that was nothing compared to the way she carried on when we came back to the city.
ARNOLD
Sounds like she does a lot of crying.
ED
Not so much anymore. We had a talk about that.
ARNOLD
Sounds like you do a lot of talking.
ED
We have a very honest relationship.
ARNOLD
I can see that. You two living together now?
ED
No. We haven't made that kind of commitment yet. To tell you the truth I'm not sure I could take being with her all the time. She has a way of closing in on me. Actually, it was much easier spending time with you. More relaxed. You're easier to talk to. (Pause) I thought about you a lot up there. We would have had a great time.
ARNOLD
I'm not the farmgirl type.
ED
No, you would have loved it. (Pause) I worried about you; how you were getting along.
ARNOLD
You could have called and found out.
ED
I thought about it. Once, when everyone was out of the house, I even started dialing.
ARNOLD
What happened?
ED
I didn't think it was fair to build up your hopes.
ARNOLD
There's just one thing I regret about our affair.
ED
What's that?
ARNOLD
That I never beat the shit out of you!
ED
You are still angry.
ARNOLD
Where's a tape recorder? No one would ever believe this.
ED
Maybe I'd better go.
ARNOLD
No, please, I'm sorry. Stay, we'll have some wine.
ED
What kind?
ARNOLD
House white. Buck-fifty a gallon! You do the honors.
ED
Kinda warm, isn't it?
ARNOLD
But cooling off nicely. I'm glad you came.
ED
So am I. (Takes a sip and gags) God! How do you drink this stuff?
ARNOLD
In large doses. So, tell me, how's your sex life?
ED
. . . Great.
ARNOLD
As good as with me?
ED
You're doing it again! Asking questions that you really don't want the answers to.
ARNOLD
Maybe I do.
ED
Arnold, I'm not sure the sex we had was always as good for me as it was for you. Sometimes I felt it got out of control.
ARNOLD
Meaning what?
ED
I don't know. Those last few times, it was like losing myself. I remember once, I don't even think I was conscious. All I remember was kissing you and then nothing until waking in your arms, my body all wet. . . .
ARNOLD
And that's bad?
ED
It's not what I want.
ARNOLD
Funny; it's what I pray for.
ED
Well, that's fine when you're twenty-four. But I'm going on thirty-four. I have other needs.
ARNOLD
Look at us together in the mirror. Now, who would ever believe that you were ten years older than me? I'm aging about as well as a Beach Party movie.
ED
You're beautiful.
ARNOLD
Is that why you left?
ED
I didn't leave you because Laurel was prettier.
ARNOLD
I know that. I've seen her. (Pause) That morning, after the phone call, I waited in a cab across from your building and watched the two of you leave for work. I was pretty shocked.
ED
We can't all look like Virginia Hamm. I happen to think she's very beautiful.
ARNOLD
Where would you be now if I was a woman?
ED
What?
ARNOLD
If I was a woman. Who would you be with?
ED
But you're not.
ARNOLD
But if I was. Would you ever even have looked at her?
ED
I love her, Arnold.
ARNOLD
Like you loved me?
ED
Like I could never love you.
ARNOLD
Because you never did love me. You were too busy running scared to love me. You were scared I'd leave you. Scared . . . someone would find out about us. Scared . . . you'd let yourself free for once in your life. Oh, I'm vain enough
ED
I did love you. Everything would be very easy for me if I didn't. But I do. (Long silence) Sometimes . . . sometimes when I have trouble reaching orgasm I imagine you behind me just about to . . .
ARNOLD
Does she know? (Ed shakes his head.) Have you talked about me at all?
ED
She knows your name. She found one of the drawings you made. The one of the tree outside my dining-room window. She may know more. I saw her looking at that music book you gave me. She didn't say anything, but remember you wrote poems to me on half the pages. (Longpause) I couldn't, Arnold. It's not what I want.
ARNOLD
What did you want to tell me. Huh? (Softly) You can talk to me. I'll understand.
ED
It's nothing really. Just a dream I had last week. I dreamt that I was in my parents' house and I went down to my father's workshop and got an old rag and a can of turpentine. Then I went to the kitchen and got a plastic bag. I took all the stuff back up to my bedroom, where I soaked the rag in the turpentine and put it into the plastic bag. Then I got into bed, made myself comfortable, pulled the covers right up to my neck, and then put the plastic bag over my head. The strangest part was as I gathered all the stuff, as I got into bed, as I began blacking out from the fumes ... I was enjoying myself, laughing up a storm. (Break) The phone woke me in the morning. It was Laurel. I couldn't understand what she was saying. Half of me was trying to listen to her, the other half trying to figure out the dream. I felt dizzy as I went back to bed, and there, on the pillow, was the plastic bag with the turpentine-soaked rag. (Long pause) I couldn't tell anyone else about it. (Taking Arnold's hand) This is what I've always wanted
ED
I'm so scared. I need you.
ARNOLD
Okay. Time out. Everybody
ED
Yes.
ARNOLD
Good. Then get out! (He grabs back his hands angrily.) Do you have any idea of what the last five months have been like for me? I cried on so many shoulders . . . I'm sure I lost half my friends. But I always knew you'd be back. But I thought that when you did come back ... I don't know, that you'd finally have your shit together. And here you are, more fucked up than ever. (SHU indecision) Have you got your car with you? (Ed nods) Go get it. I'll . . . I'll get dressed and meet you out front.
ED
Want me to drive you home?
ARNOLD
Huh?
ED
I'll get the car. (He exits.)
ARNOLD
So, what now? Huh? If I take
FUGUE IN A NURSERY PREMIERED AT LA MAMA E

PRODUCTION STAGE MANAGER
Richard Jakiel
A NOTE ON THE MUSIC A FULL SCORE FOR CLARINET
Arnold by the Cello, Alan by the Clarinet, Laurel by the Violin, and Ed by the French Horn. The musical notations of the text corresponded to the ones of the score.
LAUREL
Thirty-five. Rather unfancy in appearance. Thoughtful
AND BRIGHT
Eighteen. Shamefully beautiful. A frightened child in hustler's clothing.
IMPORTANT
In reading this script, it is imperative that close attention be paid to stage directions and character names, as the text may become unclear without that information.
ARNOLD
Happy Home for the Bewildered.
LAUREL
Hello? Is this Arnold?
ARNOLD
That's what they tell me.
LAUREL
Hi. I don't know where to start. We've never met. . .
ARNOLD
Sounds like my life story. Hang on a second, would you? {Muffled slightly) HEY! Could you turn that thing down?
ALAN
Who is it?
ARNOLD
I don't know, but if you'd turn that fakaktah thing down, I'd find out!
ALAN
If it's Murray, tell him I wanna speak to him. {The radio noises fade out.)
ARNOLD
Hello. You still there?
LAUREL
Look, am I interrupting something?
ARNOLD
Nothing you'd wanna write home about. (Sound of a toilet flushing) Well, come on. Speak up. I'm a drag queen not a mind reader.
LAUREL
Well, like I said, you don't know me but we have a mutual friend. Ed Reiss.
ARNOLD
Is that what you called to tell me?
LAUREL
No. I'd better start again. You and I have never met. But, I think you'll know who I am. My name's Laurel. Ed and I live together. We're . . . lovers. As you know, Ed has a farm upstate where we spend the weekends and our vacations. Anyway, we got to talking and thought it'd be nice to have you up to visit for a few days. Still with me?
ARNOLD
I'm way ahead of you! I'm sorry, but I'm not into any of that kinky stuff.
LAUREL
That wasn't our intention at all. I just thought you might like to get out of the city for a few days. Ed's told me so much about you and I've wanted to meet you for the longest time . . .
ARNOLD
Whose idea was this?
LAUREL
We'd both like you to come.
ARNOLD
Yeah, but whose idea was this?
LAUREL
What's the difference? The point is, I know how much Ed values your friendship and that the two of you haven't seen that much of each other lately, which probably has to do with you and I not knowing each other, but hopefully this weekend will straighten all of that out. So, what do you say?
ARNOLD
I don't think so. I appreciate the invite, it was swell of you to call, but I don't think it's such a good idea. But look, maybe after the summer you and I could get together for lunch or something . . .
ALAN
Wait a minute, I wanna go.
ARNOLD
Hang on a second, would you? (Muffled conversation) Listen, Laurel, do you think it'd be all right to bring a friend?
LAUREL
Of course. Please do. I'm sorry I didn't extend an
ARNOLD
He doesn't know about Alan.
LAUREL
Well, by all means bring him. That'll make the weekend nicer still; to have the both of you. So, we'll pick you up on the Friday train.
ARNOLD
No. We'll be driving up. Alan can borrow a car.
LAUREL
Great. Let me give you the directions.
ARNOLD
That's all right. I think I can remember how to get there.
LAUREL
Of course, you've been here before. So, we'll see you Friday. I can hardly wait.
ARNOLD
Okay. See you then.
LAUREL
Bye-bye. (Sound of phones clicking off)

LAUREL
Isn't this civilized? (Pause) Do you think they have enough blankets? Maybe I should . . .
ED
They'll be fine.
LAUREL
But it gets awfully cold . . .
ED
Laurel, they'll be fine.
LAUREL
All right. Don't be so grouchy. (Cuddling) Wanna . . . ?
ED
Aren't you tired at all?
LAUREL
I'm too excited about having them here. Don't you wanna . . .?
ED
Didn't you say you had some paperwork to do?
LAUREL
You're an old fart, you know that?
ED
Where's that newspaper?
LAUREL
This is just so civilized! Guests up to our country home for the weekend. I can't tell you how excited I am.
ED
We have had guests before.
LAUREL
I'd hardly compare this to having your sister and her kids or your parents or even friends from school up. Imagine being hostess to your lover's ex and his new boyfriend. Now, if that isn't civilized, then what is? It's downright Noel Coward. How's your English accent?
ED
What?
LAUREL
It might be fun to use English accents all weekend.
ED
Would you stop.
LAUREL
What're you being so grouchy about? I'm just fooling around. (Teasing) Are my domestic fantasies making you nervous? Don't worry. I promise I won't propose to you.
ED
Very funny.
LAUREL
What is your problem?
ED
I don't see why they can't spend a few quiet days up here without all this rigmarole.
LAUREL
I'm excited. That's all.
ED
... because this is not the weekend that I had planned.
LAUREL
I have no idea what you're talking about.
ED
Alan. That's what I'm talking about.
LAUREL
What about him? He seems really nice.
ED
I should've known Arnold would pull something like this.
LAUREL
Now, look, I told you that Arnold asked me if he could bring a friend and that I told him he could.
ED
You had no right to. . . . This weekend was supposed to be just the three of us.
LAUREL
So what's the big deal? We've got enough food for four. I didn't have to open another room or anything. What'd you expect Arnold to do? Sit around with us all day, then watch us toddle off to bed while he slept alone? It's better this way. You'll see.
ED
No, you'll see. Did you catch the way he fawned over him at dinner? He practically cut his steak for him.
LAUREL
No more than I fawned over you. (Cuddling) And I did cut your steak.
ED
I could've killed you for that.
LAUREL
You're being ridiculous. There are bound to be compensations on all four of our parts. After all, the two of you were lovers. So little games and jealousies are bound to pop up. But I'm positive it's going to be a great weekend.
ED
Did you see how he made such a point of running off to bed early? "Oh, I'm so tired. All that good food has done me in." His hands all over the boy.
LAUREL
Well, if I had something as pretty as that to go to bed with, I wouldn't stay up late either.
ED
You think he's pretty?
LAUREL
Uh-huh.
ED
I don't like them that young.
LAUREL
I do. (No reaction) They make a nice couple. Don't you think? (No answer) I think Arnold's a very handsome man. Don't know why he'd want to put on a dress.
ED
You really like them that young?
LAUREL
What?
ED
As young as Alan.
LAUREL
Sure. Why not? All that energy. Did you hear the way their bedsprings were squeaking?
ED
I think I do pretty well in the squeaking department.
LAUREL
You do, huh?
ED
Well, making certain allowances for wear and tear . . .
LAUREL
It's too early in the race to make a plea for sympathy.
ED
You want to race? (Excited) All right, we'll race. And may the best man win.
LAUREL
And now, ladies and gentlemen, in the center ring, driving a 1968 Serta Orthopedic . . . Couple Number Two . . .
ED
Hey, no tickling before the gun.
LAUREL
On your marks. . . . Get set. . . . Go!
THE LIGHTS QUICKLY BLACK OUT ON THEM AND SNAP ON FOR ALAN

ALAN
Hello.
ARNOLD
If you can't say something nice, don't say nothin' at all. (He rolls over.)
ALAN
Get your fat ass out of bed and get me something to eat. I'm hungry.
ARNOLD
Talk dirty to me.
ALAN
What? . . . Are you asleep?
ARNOLD
God, you're gorgeous. (Rolling away) Now, go away.
ALAN
Come on, wake up.
ARNOLD
But I'm having this flawless dream.
ALAN
About me?
ARNOLD
If it is, will you let me go back to sleep?
ALAN
Yes.
ARNOLD
It's all about you.
ALAN
What about me?
ARNOLD
My God, you really are awake.
ALAN
That doesn't matter.
ARNOLD
Maybe not to you . . .
ALAN
Stop changing the subject.
ARNOLD
Waste not, want not.
ALAN
Tell me the dream. (Holding him off)
ARNOLD
If you like it can we? . . .
ALAN
No.
ARNOLD
Then I'm going back to sleep.
ALAN
Then I'm going to see if anyone else is up.
ARNOLD
Give my best to the bisexuals.
ALAN
Only he's bisexual. She's straight.
ARNOLD
How do you know?
ALAN
She told me so.
ARNOLD
Too bad. Mixed marriages never work.
ALAN
Yeah, then what were you doing with him?
ARNOLD
Slumming.
ALAN
And what're you doing with me?
ARNOLD
Nothing. It's gone.
ALAN
It'll be back.
ARNOLD
But it won't be the same.
ALAN
Of course it will.
ARNOLD
Do you ever think before you speak?
ALAN
No. Do you?
ARNOLD
Frequently. It passes the time while you're speaking.
ALAN
Be nice.
ARNOLD
Go back to sleep and wake up horny.
ALAN
You still haven't told me your dream.
ARNOLD
Why'd you wanna come up here this weekend?
ALAN
What's this black shit on the pillow?
ARNOLD
What black shit on the pillow?
ALAN
This black shit on the pillow.
ARNOLD
It's black shit on the pillow.
ALAN
Bullshit.
ARNOLD
Bullshit, black shit, why'd you wanna come?
ALAN
What do you mean?
ARNOLD
Never mind. Talk dirty to me.
ALAN
Tell me the dream.
ARNOLD
I ain't tellin' you nothin'. You lied to me.
ALAN
About what?
ARNOLD
You said it would come back. What's it waiting for?
ALAN
It's waiting to hear the dream.
ARNOLD
Is it really into that sort of stuff?
ALAN
We're waiting.
ARNOLD
How old are you?
ALAN
You know how old I am.
ARNOLD
Tell me again, I need reassurance.
ALAN
The dream?
ARNOLD
I know who you are. You're the son I always avoided having. Why's the lamp on?
ALAN
It's still dark out.
ARNOLD
Is there a storm?
ALAN
No, the sun's not up yet.
ARNOLD
You woke me in the middle of the night again?
ALAN
Do you mind?
ARNOLD
Of course not. (Taking the boy into his arms like a child) Come on. What frightened you?
ALAN
Nothing. I just felt like talking.
ARNOLD
Comfortable?
ALAN
Tighter. Did Ed ever have bad dreams?
ARNOLD
Everyone does.
ALAN
Did you have to hold him?
ARNOLD
Talk dirty to me.
ALAN
Get me a dog.
ARNOLD
Why?
ALAN
I want one.
ARNOLD
I don't give you things.
ALAN
Yes you do. (Arnold stiffens.) No you don't. But, a dog's not a thing.
ARNOLD
All the more reason.
ALAN
C'mon, get me a dog.
ARNOLD
I have no money for a dog.
ALAN
You can get one at the pound. They're free.
ARNOLD
Then get one yourself.
ALAN
I will. Can I keep it at your place?
ARNOLD
You shouldn't wear cologne. It tastes terrible.
ALAN
Sometimes they have dogs up for adoption in the paper. Where's that other copy of the Voice?
ARNOLD
Under the bed. (Alan starts for it.) No, don't move. I want to remember me like this forever.
ALAN
I want a cigarette anyway.
ARNOLD
Is that what you tell the other models at the studio; that I buy you things and that's why you live with me?
ALAN
No. Of course not.
ARNOLD
You make more money modeling for an hour than I do in a week. I don't buy you things. Don't say I do.
ALAN
I don't.
ARNOLD
Good. 'Cause I don't. Not things. Cigarettes. That's all.
ALAN
All right already. Want a cigarette?
ARNOLD
They're mine, aren't they?
ALAN
Then do you mind if I have one?
ARNOLD
That's why they're here. Don't do that to yourself; treat yourself like a piece of meat. It's what all them leering faggots do, so you don't have to do it to yourself.
ALAN
I don't.
ARNOLD
At least stop enjoying it. You don't have to be a model.
ALAN
You don't have to be a drag queen.
ARNOLD
How ridiculous! They're not the same things at all.
ALAN
What's the difference?
ARNOLD
A model IS. A drag queen . . . aspires.
ALAN
Great aspirations!
ARNOLD
Very funny. I'm serious, Alan. Fantasies are fine in the bedroom, but outside they're not fantasies, they're lies.
ALAN
What are you talking about?
ARNOLD
Your hustler trips.
ALAN
Would you stop? Where's that newspaper?
ARNOLD
Here.
ALAN
I love you.
LAUREL
I don't believe I've seen you this turned on in months. If that's Arnold's effect on you, then I think I'll ask him to move in.
ED
It's not Arnold, it's you.
LAUREL
Is that why you called me Arnold?
ED
I did not.
LAUREL
Oh yes you did. Deep into loving, you whispered into my ear, "I love you, Arnold."
ED
That's not funny. You shouldn't make up things like that.
LAUREL
I'm not. What're you getting so upset about? Minds wander during sex. It's like dreaming; all sorts of things pass through the mind. I once blurted out the phone number of the house I grew up in. I'm not upset you called me Arnold, so there's no reason for you to be.
ED
I never called you Arnold. That's something passing in your mind.
LAUREL
All right. So I misheard you. Take it easy.
ED
It's that damned kid. This was going to be a beautiful weekend. The three of us together. I thought. . . that having the two of you here together . . . that I'd be able to put a period on that whole section of my life. But the second he walked through the door I knew that I'd put the period there long ago and this whole weekend was unnecessary.
LAUREL
Well, thanks a lot. I'm glad you've made up your mind.
ED
That's not what I meant. I wasn't planning on comparing the two of you. Christ! Everything was going to be so simple, I wanted us all to be friends. Then Arnold had to bring that kid.
LAUREL
He also brought a cake, a lace tablecloth, and The Village Voice. (Handing him the paper) Enjoy them all.
ED
Come here and I'll read you the funny pages.
LAUREL
I have my own reading, thank you.
ARNOLD
Feels so strange. I can't get over it; you and I in this room with them in there. This was my room, y'know. I mean, we slept together in there but I kept my clothes in here in case any neighbors or family dropped in and peeked around. He didn't want them to think we were queer or anything. I can't believe I put up with that.
ALAN
So, what do you think?
ARNOLD
About what?
ALAN
Ed. Seeing him again with me to compare him to.
ARNOLD
Is that what I'm supposed to be doing?
ALAN
Sure. I have.
ARNOLD
So, what do you think?
ALAN
He ain't so hot. Not hot enough to be "The Great Love of Your Life" anyway.
ARNOLD
I don't consider him "The Great Love of My Life." But he's got his good points. He's good-natured, good-looking, good in bed . . .
ALAN
. . . good and boring.
ARNOLD
He's not good and boring. He's just plain boring. But there's worse things to be. I once knew this guy who . . .
ALAN
There's a lot of that going around.
ARNOLD
Hey, who's the straight man here?
ALAN
I'm at that impressionable age. You're rubbing off on me.
ARNOLD
I never touched the Gray boy.
ALAN
Feel better?
ARNOLD
Yeah. So anyway, I once knew this guy . . .
ALAN
Did you really love Ed?
ARNOLD
I guess so.
ALAN
And he loved you.
ARNOLD
I wouldn't say that.
ALAN
I would. I see how he looks at you. Why'd you two break up?
ARNOLD
We wanted different things.
ALAN
Like what?
ARNOLD
I wanted a husband and he wanted a wife.
ALAN
You ever think of going back with him?
ARNOLD
You can't go back.
ALAN
Why not?
ARNOLD
Because.
ALAN
Because why?
ARNOLD
Because . . . because . . . because people change. They're never the same twice. So how can you go back?
ALAN
Well, did you ever want to start out fresh again?
ARNOLD
Jesus Christ! Were you ever not true to form? Thank God I was not your mother. I could have denied you nothing. I am in awe of her that she denied you as much as she did for you to need to ask for so much now.
ALAN
When I said that I loved you before, you didn't answer me.
ARNOLD
I didn't realize that it was a question.
ALAN
Well?
ARNOLD
Here, read the newspaper. (Throws it at him) (Alan rolls away) Are you pouting? This child is unbelievable. Come, I'll read to you. Okay? Okay.
A SLIDE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN
CODETTA
ED
Banes, Iowa. "That'll teach them folks not to mess around with true love," beamed eighty-year-old Sarah Fonedwell as she left the Iowa courtroom arm in arm with her fifteen-year-old boyfriend.
LAUREL
You made me stop working to listen to that?
ED
I think it's very funny. Don't you?
ARNOLD
That's disgusting.
LAUREL
Would you think it was so funny if it had been an eighty-year-old man seducing a fifteen-year-old girl? You think the judge would have said it was all in her education?
ED
But it wasn't.
ALAN
I don't know, I think it's kind of sexy.
LAUREL
Sexy?
ED
Yeah, sure. Imagine his feeling of power. The strength he must have felt
ALAN
Think of the pleasure he gave her. I bet she even thought she was fifteen again.
LAUREL
You see him as the giver and her as the taker? That's even more perverse than I'd imagined it. I saw her giving her last favor; passing on her last gift to the next generation. But you see it as a simple matter of lust.
ED
Well, if you'd listened to the way she talked, you'd see she's obviously just a dirty old lady.
ARNOLD
I can't believe that anyone would be that self-destructive. I mean, if she was eighty to begin with, how old was she when it was over?
ALAN
Obviously, she was rejuvenated in his arms. A miracle of modern sex.
ARNOLD
The only miraculous thing about modern sex is that it exists.
LAUREL
Did you ever sleep with someone then wonder who gave more; or who enjoyed it more?
ARNOLD
Could we change the subject?
ALAN
They don't buy the milk if they can get the cow for free.
ARNOLD
That's what I like to hear
LAUREL
At the risk of rendering you impotent for the remainder of "The Milkman's Matinee," could you make love to me if I was an eighty-year-old woman and you a fifteen-year-old boy?
ALAN
Fierce, passionate love.
ARNOLD
Ah, but would I make love to you?
ED
Why not?
LAUREL
You could really sleep with an eighty-year-old woman?
ED
Are we talking about me or me if I was fifteen?
ALAN
At least she was willing to give it a go.
ED
I give what I can and trust that it's enough.
ALAN
Not unless you can slip in a few one-liners.
ED
I don't lie awake nights wondering whether I gave more or you gave more or about how old you are or if you're pretty or not. And yes, I could probably make love to an eighty-year-old woman. I could make love to an eighty-year-old camel. I could probably make love to anything ... as long as it kept its mouth shut.
ALAN
Shhhhhhh! (Listening) I thought I heard someone talking.
ARNOLD
It was probably Ed talking in his sleep.
ALAN
He talks in his sleep?
ARNOLD
Talks, screams, gnashes his teeth, kicks . . .
ALAN
Really? How'd you ever get any sleep?
ARNOLD
I never slept better.
ALAN
You really loved him, huh?
ARNOLD
We starting that again?
ALAN
I'm just curious. Why?
ARNOLD
Wha'd'ya mean, "Why?" Why does anyone love anyone? Because I did. Because ... I did. Because ... he let me.
A SLIDE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN
STRETTO
ALAN
I'm not talking to you. Deserting me all afternoon like that. Where the hell did the two of you disappear to anyway?
ARNOLD
We spent the afternoon in bed. Jealous?
ALAN
Why should I be? You didn't do anything.
ARNOLD
How do you know? We were alone for three hours.
LAUREL
If you say you only talked, then I believe you. Though I can't say I understand why you had to do it in bed.
ARNOLD
You remember that poem about sleep
ED
Something about there being no limitations on dreams?
ARNOLD
Yeah, that's the one. Well, I figure if everyone's equal in sleep then just lying down makes you at least reachable. Besides, that's where I do my best thinking. Don't have to worry about the body, it just relaxes, leaving all the blood for the brain.
ED
I used to call your bedroom the Nursery, remember? It was always so warm and comfortable and safe.
ARNOLD
I thought it was because we never went to bed without a bottle.
ED
And you saved every bottle we drank together. You still have them?
ARNOLD
Nah.
ED
You said you wanted to make something out of them.
ARNOLD
When we broke up I did. Quite a racket. (Mimes throwing bottles) And quite a mess. So tell me, what's new with you?
ED
Not much.
ARNOLD
Well, are you seeing anyone? (Ed laughs.) That wasn't supposed to be funny. You have been known to sidestep on occasion.
ED
Not since we've been together.
ARNOLD
Give it time.
ED
I doubt it. I really do love her very much.
ARNOLD
I'm happy for you. What can I say? It's what you said you wanted and I'm glad it's working out.
ED
Are you jealous?
ARNOLD
No. Should I be?
ED
You don't love him.
ARNOLD
What's that got to do with anything.
ED
'Cause I'm jealous of him anyway.
LAUREL
So, tell me about yourself.
ALAN
I had to talk to her all afternoon. Nothing else to do with the two of you running off. Y'know she tried to make me? It's the truth. And not even me. I mean it wasn't me she was trying to make, particularly. She's just got this thing for faggots. It's true. Ask her. She'll tell you the whole story. I think she likes to tell the story as much as she likes to make the faggots. Anyway, she's proved you wrong. You said people only went after me because of my looks, but she went after me because of my likes.
ED
This feels wonderful.
ALAN
You know, at first I was insulted; being wanted just because I'm gay. But, that's almost like being wanted for myself. ... I think I'm flattered.
ARNOLD
Hey, watch your hands. I'm a married man.
LAUREL
So, tell me about yourself.
ALAN
I'm a model. Clothes, toothpaste . . . anything they can sell with an All-American puss. I'd like to be an actor, but I think I'll let that ride until I've made all I can out of being the American Dream.
LAUREL
And what about your childhood?
ALAN
According to Arnold, it's only just begun.
LAUREL
Arnold really is something else. You two must be very happy together.
ALAN
Believe me, there are easier things than living with Arnold. He thinks it's immoral, that it makes him a lesser person to love me because I'm good-looking.
LAUREL
Oh, come on.
ALAN
No, really. He'd be much happier if I was his age, his size, his . . . size. Sometimes I'm not sure if he wants a lover or a bookend.
LAUREL
It's good that you have a sense of humor. Ed has none. But that's part of his charm.
ALAN
No wonder they didn't last.
LAUREL
Well, I think there's more to it than that. But I can't tell you how happy I am that Arnold has you. My reasons may be a little selfish. Y'know, they were still going together when I met Ed. I didn't know it, of course. If I did I never would have started seeing Ed. See, I met him through a friend from group . . .
ALAN
Group? Like in therapy group?
LAUREL
That's right. It's kind of a story, I guess. I had just come through a rather bad affair with a guy who turned out to be bisexual. (The bi leaning toward his new boyfriend.)
ALAN
A real live blind date. How exotic.
LAUREL
Blind indeed. We'd been dating for over a month before he ever told me about Arnold. But by then, it was too late to pull out without a fight.
ALAN
So you fought?
LAUREL
No, that's not what I meant. I mean, it wasn't a fight. I just pulled back enough to let Ed feel his freedom
ARNOLD
You never told me about the shrink.
ED
Because I know how you feel about "Shrinks." But really, the group's been very supportive. They've never pushed me toward any decision that I didn't want to make.
ARNOLD
Now I know where all that "I owe myself the chance to lead a normal life" bullshit came from. So, I suppose you're straight now?
ED
Not now. I always have been.
ARNOLD
And me? . . . And all the others, what were we—a phase you were going through?
ED
You always were a homosexual chauvinist. To you everyone's either gay or in the closet.
ARNOLD
What's sex like with her?
ED
It's very beautiful.
ARNOLD
Is it satisfying?
ED
I'm with her, aren't I?
ARNOLD
So, what does that mean? I could've kept you. You don't believe it, but it's true. I've done a lot of thinking about you and some of the others I've been through and I think I've found a pattern
ED
I never saw myself the villain.
ARNOLD
You never saw yourself period.
ED
I wouldn't have stayed. In the year that Laurel and I have been seeing each other I haven't once fooled around. And believe me, our relationship allows for that. No, I wouldn't have stayed. {Thinks) I bet you think you could get me back if you wanted to.
ARNOLD
I don't want to. That's precisely my point. Why waste all that energy? When an affair hits the skids you shed it like last year's fashion and head back to the streets. There are plenty more where that one came from. And that, my ex-husband, is what I call the miracle of modern sex.
LAUREL
We attend private sessions on Tuesdays and on Thursdays we have group. You and Arnold should try it. Maybe not the private sessions but a group's the ideal way to open up the lines of communication between two people and really solidify a relationship.
ALAN
Sounds inspiring.
ED
And what about you? You don't love that kid.
ARNOLD
You said that, not me.
ED
So, do you?
ARNOLD
Maybe. What makes you think I'm in love with anyone?
ED
Because we've been lying in bed together for over an hour in and out of each other's arms and you've yet to make a pass at me.
ARNOLD
That's not love. That's good taste.
ED
Come on, Arnold, who is it? No, let me guess . . . could it be me?
ARNOLD
God, the EGO!!!!
ED
I was only kidding.
ARNOLD
You wouldn't know him anyway. I don't know him. Not really.
ED
You wouldn't love him if you did.
ARNOLD
You're really impossible.
ED
Who is he?
ARNOLD
Well, you know The International Stud bar has this dark backroom where everyone goes to fool around. . . . What am I telling you for? I wouldn't know about such things if it wasn't for you showing them to me. Anyway, I've been going there a lot lately. Two, three times a week.
ED
What does Alan have to say about that?
ARNOLD
We have a very honest and open relationship. So, there's this guy there that I meet every night and we always get it on together. We haven't talked about anything really and we meet there only by chance. I mean, we haven't set it up that way or anything. It's just that he's always there
ED
No, go on, it sounds very romantic.
ARNOLD
Just forget it, all right?
ED
I'm sorry, but first you tell me you're in love. Then you tell me you can only get it on in a backroom. . . .
ARNOLD
That's not it at all.
ED
Have you ever made love together alone?
ARNOLD
No, but. . .
ED
Have you ever had a drink together in the light of the front room?
ARNOLD
He's very shy.
ED
Arnold, I think you've reached a new plateau of perversity.
ARNOLD
Hey, wait a minute here, who gospeled to whom about the advantages of the backroom. I'd never seen a backroom until after you. . . .
ED
I never took you into one.
ARNOLD
But that's where you would rather have taken me. If we'd met and stayed in the backroom we never would have had the problems we did.
ED
Is that your answer now? Put the blame on me. "Ed, you hurt me so bad. I'll never trust to love again." So, you're going to play this one nice and safe.
ARNOLD
Look who's knocking safety! Mr. All-American Heterosexual! Locked your life up tight, didn't you. Picked yourself a nice little wifey type, plain and lonely enough to never worry about her stepping out on you, pleasant and giving enough to boss her around to get her to do anything or go anywhere that you want. And you're gonna read my beads? (Arnold makes a dive under the covers.)
ED
Hey! What are you doing?
ARNOLD
Take it easy. I'm just looking for a second opinion.
ED
I thought you were trying to get to the bottom of me.
ARNOLD
Heterosexuality has done nada for your wit. Your feet stink.
ED
They weren't expecting company.
ARNOLD
What's this?
ED
My cologne.
ARNOLD
What is it, "Ben-Hur"? (Sprinkles it about) Now I'm in my element. Toss me a pillow. (Ed does.) Thanks. And just what's wrong with playing it safe? I can sleep when I want, eat when I want, fuck when I want. . .
ED
. . . want when you want.
ARNOLD
Cheap shot.
ED
Can I just ask you a question? If you don't love Alan, why do you stay with him?
ARNOLD
He needs me.
ED
Come on.
ARNOLD
All right, I need him.
ED
Forget I asked.
ARNOLD
What the hell would you know about need? You're like a baby in a crib, hands and fingers flexing, "Gimme. Gimme.'' You're all want. So, maybe I don't love him, but I need that gorgeous imbecile and I like to think that he needs me.
ED
So, he's like a pet.
ARNOLD
You're a pig, you know that?
ED
Arnold, I am exhausted from trying to understand.
ARNOLD
It gets easier with practice. He ain't complaining.
ED
Don't you think he deserves to be loved?
ARNOLD
Of course he does. Who doesn't? But, who is?
ED
I am.
ARNOLD
What do you suppose it is that makes me want to shove a chair up your nose? (Pause) What the hell am I supposed to do
ED
That's not what I meant. I'm very happy you have him, all right?
ARNOLD
You and Laurel working on having kids yet?
ED
We haven't really discussed it in detail.
ARNOLD
Don't you still want kids?
ED
Still? Who said anything about having kids?
ARNOLD
You did. Don't you remember? At the party there was that woman who arranged for gay couples to adopt. You probably don't remember, you said you wanted a boy, but you were gay then.
ED
I remember. But that was just talk. You know, a fantasy.
ARNOLD
Is that what it was?
ED
Sure, like our airplane, and our island . . .
ARNOLD
. . . and our relationship.
ED
That was one of the things that made me love you
ARNOLD
'Cause I didn't know it wasn't. Those things weren't fantasies to me. To me a fantasy is a Genie or a magic lamp, something impossible that you wouldn't really want even if you could have it. Our airplane, our island, our child . . . they
ED
What's the inflation ratio—items as opposed to check marks?
ARNOLD
Never counted.
ED
Am I on the list?
ARNOLD
Listed and checked off.
ED
That's cheating. You don't have me.
ARNOLD
Don't I?
ED
No.
ARNOLD
I'll be sure to correct my ledger first thing Monday morning.
ED
Tell me something, what would you do with a subscription to National Geographic?
ARNOLD
Look at the dirty pictures.
ED
Oh.
ARNOLD PULLS A PILLOW OVER HIS HEAD IN DISGUST AS A SLIDE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN

LAUREL
Hurry up, you two sleepyheads, breakfast is on the table.
ARNOLD
Sleepyheads?
ALAN
Breakfast? How'd you sleep?
ARNOLD
Awfully. I dreamt that I was walking down this twisting path and no matter how carefully I watched I kept stepping in cowpies. . . .
ALAN
You mean cowchips. Not pies. Chips.
ARNOLD
Whatever. Anyway, as I turned a corner around this big Camperdown elm I saw Ed squatting down naked making the cowpies ... or chips. Now, what the hell do you suppose that was supposed to mean?
ALAN
Maybe it was prophetic dreaming.
ARNOLD
Prophesying what?
ALAN
Maybe the toilet's gonna bust.
LAUREL
C'mon, you two. We'll be late for church.
ARNOLD
She say "Church"?
ALAN
Didn't you know, Ed plays organ for the services every Sunday morning.
ARNOLD
Give me a break. And they say dreams are meaningless?
LAUREL
Aren't you two coming?
ARNOLD
Actually, Laurel, I'd love to go but my religion strictly forbids entering any church for other than historical purposes
LAUREL
Nonsense. I have lots of Jewish friends that visit churches.
ARNOLD
Oh, but I'm not Jewish anymore. I've converted. I'm what you'd call a Scientific American. Yes. See ... we believe that all of mankind's problems can be solved with vitamins.
ALAN
Groan!
LAUREL
So, you have no need for prayer.
ARNOLD
I wouldn't say that. I'm often found on my knees.
ALAN
Groan!
LAUREL
But if you can't enter a house of God, where do you pray?
ARNOLD
Harvard.
ALAN
Groan!!! (Arnold leaps on him, laughing.)
ED
What's the matter?
LAUREL
Nothing. Are you ready?
ED
Are they coming down?
LAUREL
No. They're sleeping in.
ED
What's the matter? Did Arnold say something?
LAUREL
I'm not upset. Are you coming?
ED
This weekend's not turning out the way you thought it would either. Is it? Just remember, it was your idea.
LAUREL
I like Arnold. I really do. It's just. . . when I thought about this weekend I knew it was a setup for all sorts of competitions, comparisons . . . and I was ready for them. After all, I knew no matter what happened that I had you. I knew you'd made your choice between us and felt I could deal with anything knowing you had chosen me.
ED
That's what I've been saying all along.
LAUREL
Would you just listen? . . . That's not what's happening here. Arnold is so relaxed, as if he has nothing on his mind, like he's simply visiting friends for the weekend.
ED
What's wrong with that?
LAUREL
He's just too sure of himself. Like a kid all puffed up with a secret.
ED
Are you sorry they're here?
LAUREL
No. Just aware. (Lights out on them)
ALAN
You weren't very nice to her.
ARNOLD
I do have my limits, and one of them happens to be Sunday morning Mountain Church services. Actually, I'm shocked that Ed let her ask us at all. He probably would have introduced us as long-lost relatives. The charcoal-gray sheep of the family.
ALAN
Kissing cousins. So, what do you make of her?
ARNOLD
She's all right. A little too giving and gracious for my tastes, but deep down she's a survivor.
ALAN
How can you say that? She makes the same mistakes over and over.
ARNOLD
Once is a mistake. Twice a misfortunate coincidence. But three times and you can start writing your memoirs.
ALAN
He's number four.
ARNOLD
I wonder if maybe she's really gay? I know just the woman to bring her out too. Bet she'd make a great lesbian.
ALAN
And you'd make a great lamp.
ARNOLD
I'm afraid I'd make a great deal more than that.
ALAN
I'll make do. . . .
LIGHTS OUT ON THEM AS A SLIDE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN
STRETTO
ED
Laurel, that was a delicious lunch. Isn't she a great cook, Arnold? Besides being beautiful.
ARNOLD
Just delicious. And beautiful.
ALAN
I bet I've gained five pounds in the past two days.
ARNOLD
Here, let me help you with those dishes.
LAUREL
No, I'm fine. Ed, why don't you take Arnold and Alan out to the barn and show them our new canning machine. We've been canning all our own vegetables, you know.
ARNOLD
Really? Ed, why don't you take Alan and show it to him. He's the real can connoisseur in the family. I'll stay and help Laurel. We've yet to have a moment alone to compare notes on you.
ED
Just what Laurel's been waiting for.
LAUREL
Ed!
ED
Let's hit the road before the fur starts flying. Grab that bottle of brandy. No need for us to rough it.
ALAN
Go start packing. We're getting out of here tonight.
ARNOLD
Would you stop?
ALAN
I suppose you're going to tell me you spent another innocent afternoon in bed. Only this time with her.
ARNOLD
It was not an afternoon, it was only an hour. And we spent it in the kitchen doing dishes. You knew where we were. If you were lonely you should have come in.
ALAN
Oh, I wasn't lonely. I had lots of company. He tried to make me.
ARNOLD
Would you please . . .
ALAN
I'd like to be able to spend two minutes in this house without someone trying to shove me onto a couch . . .
ED
Would you like another brandy?
ALAN
. . . and you put down the studio? At least when someone makes a pass at me there, it's got a trip to Europe or a movie contract as part of the deal. Here it's "Alone at last!" and a dive for my zipper.
ED
Well, here we are
ARNOLD
Alan, when we walk down the street and an old lady asks you for the time, you swear she's trying to make you. Now, I'd be the last to say you weren't irresistible, but, Angel, there are limits. (Joins Laurel)
ED
We can sit on this haystack. (Alan joins him.)
ARNOLD
Isn't this civilized? Doing the dishes.
LAUREL
Stuck with the dishes. I feel like we went out to lunch, you thinking that I was treating and I thinking that you were treating and here we are
ARNOLD
No, I know, we're in-laws on one of them detergent commercials.
LAUREL
"Why, Marge, your dishes are so shiny. I can see myself!"
ARNOLD
"Well, so can I!" Platter, platter on the stack. Does she think I want him back? (He winces a bit.)
LAUREL
You work fast. I thought we'd kinda waltz around the table a few times first.
ARNOLD
Sorry, I thought we might as well get it out of the way.
LAUREL
So, do you?
ARNOLD
What do you think?
LAUREL
I think you do.
ARNOLD
Really. Why?
LAUREL
Well, you don't love Alan.
ARNOLD
I keep hearing that. What makes you think I don't love Alan?
LAUREL
How could you when you still love Ed?
ARNOLD
What makes you think I still love Ed?
LAUREL
Well, I know that from the start you loved Ed more than he loved you. . . .
ARNOLD
He told you that?
LAUREL
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
ARNOLD
Of course not. If it's true that one person always loves more than the other, why not be one who feels the most? But why would that make you think I'd want him back now?
LAUREL
You're here, aren't you?
ARNOLD
You asked me to come.
LAUREL
Still, you didn't have to. (Uncomfortably) Look, I know more about your relationship than you might think. We have few secrets and a great deal of openness. It's the kind of relationship we have. We share almost everything with complete freedom. . . . What I'm trying to say is that I know a great deal of what was said between you. . . .
ARNOLD
So?
LAUREL
Please. So, I know what it feels like to be in that position. You felt hurt, rejected, angry. . . . Then you started to wonder if there was ever anything between you. Or maybe you'd made it all up? Who's to blame for that? Who's to blame for breaking up?
ARNOLD
Are we talking about you or me?
LAUREL
You told Ed that you could get him back if you wanted to.
ARNOLD
I also told him that I didn't want to.
LAUREL
Then why do you call him all the time? I know about your calls in the afternoon while I'm at work.
ARNOLD
He told you that I call him?
LAUREL
I told you, we have a very honest relationship.
ARNOLD
Laurel, I don't want you to misunderstand and think I'm calling Ed a liar, but I've never called him. Yes, we've spoken on the phone, but he has always called me. And I've made those conversations as brief as was politely possible. He'd call and tell me all about how happy the two of you were and all about his family (none of whom I've ever met) and I'd say a nice little good-bye and that was that.
LAUREL
Then why'd you come up here?
ARNOLD
To see how my paint job was holding up. Y'know, I painted this room. Took me days. I was scared shitless of dripping on the floor; you know what a fussbudget Ed can be. . . .
LAUREL
I'm sorry. I have no right to talk to you this way. I'm pushing you to admit something that you're obviously not ready to face.
ARNOLD
You're pushing me all right! But I don't think you realize toward what. Laurel . . . are you happy with Ed?
LAUREL
The happiest I've ever been in my life.
ARNOLD
So what else do you want?
ALAN
To own a disco. (Lights out on Arnold and Laurel, leaving Alan and Ed quite alone) I knew this guy, he was a few years older than me, who'd met this older guy who set him up in business. I figured that I could do the same. But when I made my entrance into the Big Apple, and believe me, a blue-eyed blond of fourteen makes quite an entrance into any apple, I found that no one was interested in hearing about my business skills. In fact, no one was interested in anything much besides my price tag for an evening. See, people with tastes for blue-eyed blonds of fourteen are used to paying for it and consider a freebie suspicious, if not downright immoral. And so, I be-
ED
Arnold!
ALAN
No, Arnold was more of a detour.
ED
That's Arnold.
ALAN
One night, I went out drinking with a friend and got more than usually polluted. Somehow I ended up in a Lower East Side bar that had a drag show. Anyway, I wound up in a fight with this big black guy who threw me down on a table, jumped up on my chest, and put a knife to my neck. Everyone was screaming and crowding around to watch me get cut, when all of a sudden there was silence, and the crowd parted to make an aisle, and up through it like Moses through the Red Sea came this Amazon woman. You never seen anything like it. She was beautiful! Not like "pretty" beautiful, but like "mountain" beautiful. You know what I mean?
ED
That's Arnold!
ALAN
She put her hand out to the black guy like this, (He demonstrates the gesture with haughty glare) and he just handed over the knife and disappeared. No words, no nothing, just like that.
ED
When did you realize it was a guy?
ALAN
I was too drunk that night to realize that / was a guy. I sort of. . . fell onto that discovery the next morning.
ED
How'd you feel about it?
ALAN
I'm with him, aren't I? (Easing away. Holding up his glass.) More, please. (Ed pours.) Now, you tell me about you. That's the whole reason we're here.
ALAN
Sure is. Arnold didn't want to come, but I wasn't going to let this chance to see my competition go by.
ED
I'm no competition. (He moves closer again.)
ALAN
Well, then, my predecessor. Stop changing the subject. Tell me about you.
ED
Why don't you ask Arnold to tell you. I'm sure he's got lots to say on the subject.
ALAN
He has.
ED
And?
ALAN
He says you're a self-centered, insensitive, boring fool who wouldn't know love if it wore wings, a diaper, and shot heart-shaped arrows at your butt.
ED
Meaning himself?
ALAN
Meaning himself. (Lying down triumphantly) Anything you'd care to add?
ED
No, that'll do. (Lying down next to him) And what do you think?
ALAN
I'll reserve my judgment until I can make a closer inspection.
ED
Close enough?
ALAN
Too close for comfort. You asked me to sit in the hay, not roll in it.
ED
It was a two-part question. I think you're very beautiful.
ALAN
I thought you were reformed.
ED
I'm not proposing marriage to you. (Gently pulling him back) If you want me to stop just say so. Do you? (No response) I didn't think so.
ARNOLD
I don't know when to stop. That's my problem. Me and my fucking mouth. I didn't come up here to hurt her. I didn't even come up here to hurt him. (Though that would've been all right.) I was so proud of myself until now. I thought I was really handling this whole situation so maturely. I guess I was saving it all up for that. (To Alan as if he were there) I hope you're enjoying all this.
ALAN
Oh, I am.
ARNOLD
Good. 'Cause it's all your fault. Couldn't take no for an answer, you just had to come up here. Why couldn't I just keep my trap shut? I've always thought of myself as a kind person. Not saintly but generously thoughtful (in a bitchy sort of way). But since being here, I have said nothing that hasn't hurt someone
ALAN
How many dishes did she break over your head?
ARNOLD
Not enough to keep me quiet.
ALAN
You elaborated?
ARNOLD
Ad infinitum. I quoted every report I could lay my brain on concerning bisexuality and its inherent unresolved immaturity, backing each prejudiced selection with a biased statistic . . .
ALAN
I love when you get technical.
ARNOLD
. . . and finished her off with a quote from the man in question himself
ALAN
Mercy! Mercy!
ARNOLD
Can that crap. This is for real.
ALAN
What're you getting so upset about? Who ever listens to you?
ARNOLD
There's always a first time. Come here and comfort me! Can't you see I'm disturbed?!?
ALAN
Why should I if you're such a rat?
ARNOLD
Because the innocent must suffer, not the guilty. This is America.
ALAN
You ain't so tough. (Embracing) That feel better?
ARNOLD
And she took it. Stood there staring me straight in the eye and listened to it all. Never argued, just nodded. God, you smell so good.
ALAN
Better than him?
ARNOLD
Now you're gonna start? (Messing his hair) He's jealous of you. Really. He told me so himself.
ALAN
Who isn't? I have you, don't I? (Embrace) You shouldn't have disappeared with her all afternoon. How do you think I felt?
ARNOLD
How'd you feel?
ALAN
You just shouldn't've.
ARNOLD
What're you, a baby? I gotta sit and hold your hand?
ALAN
I came up here to be with you, not him. Let's get outta here.
THE LIGHTS LOWER AS A SLIDE APPEARS

ARNOLD
Hello?
ED
Hi. I woke you.
ARNOLD
Good guess. Hold on a second. (He sits up and tries to shake the sleep.) Hello? Listen I was gonna call you later to thank you for the weekend. (Morning cough) As you can hear, the country air's done wonders for me.
ED
I thought I'd call to make sure you two got home all right.
ARNOLD
Yeah, fine. We drove straight through.
ED
I really enjoyed having you here. So did Laurel.
ARNOLD
I'm glad. We did too.
ED
You know, we got a lot out of having you up here. We learned a lot about our relationship.
ARNOLD
You holding seminars?
ED
Couldn't you be nice?
ARNOLD
Sorry, morning breath and all.
ED
Is Alan there with you?
ARNOLD
No, he dropped me off, then headed out to Queens to bring the car back to his mother. I guess he spent the night.
ED
Oh. But he'll be back tonight?
ARNOLD
I suppose. What's the difference?
ED
I was curious, that's all.
ARNOLD
Something wrong?
ED
Not at all.
ARNOLD
You sound funny.
ED
No. But I do have a favor to ask.
ARNOLD
Shoot.
ED
Well. . . Laurel went into the city this morning to spend a few days. Just to check on some classes. . . . Anyway, I thought
ARNOLD
Shit, look, Ed, I'm really sorry I caused trouble. . . .
ED
Oh, no. We didn't have words or anything. I just felt that it would be better if we both had time to think about our relationship.
ARNOLD
I understand.
ED
I know you do. I love her very much.
ARNOLD
Have you tried telling her that?
ED
She's not like you, Arnold. She doesn't need to be reassured every hour on the hour.
ARNOLD
An admirable quality, to be sure.
ED
Will you talk to her?
ARNOLD
Don't worry about a thing.
ED
I appreciate it.
ARNOLD
Anything else?
ED
There is one thing more.
ARNOLD
Don't stop now.
ED
Did you have a chance to correct that list yet?
ARNOLD
What list?
ED
Of the things you want. Remember, I told you to erase the check mark next to my name.
ARNOLD
As a matter of fact, I haven't had the time. But don't you worry, I'll take care of it.
ED
Don't. I mean ... I'd like it if you left the check mark where it is.
LAUREL
So what'd you tell him?
ARNOLD
I told him I'd leave the check mark but erase the name.
LAUREL
You didn't?!?
ARNOLD
No, I didn't. But I should've. I don't know, sometimes I get the feeling he's learning, but God, it's a struggle. You going back to him?
LAUREL
I don't think so. I don't know.
ARNOLD
What'd your shrink say?
LAUREL
Not much. Nothing, as a matter of fact, nothing. He just kept asking me what I want. Over and over again, "What do you want?" "What do you want?"
ARNOLD
And what did you tell him?
LAUREL
I told him I wanted him to shut up.
ARNOLD
You didn't.
LAUREL
No, I didn't. But I should've. What do you want?
ARNOLD
I wanna beer.
LAUREL
You know what I mean.
ARNOLD
What do I want? What do I want? What do I want? Well, it would have to be something witty because you're depressed and it's not enough to be funny when talking to a depressed person. One must be cleverly diverting or at least playfully bawdy. . . .
LAUREL
Your brain is hopelessly delinquent.
ARNOLD
That's what I want
LAUREL
Alan and you are wonderful together. I'm sure everything will work itself out.
ARNOLD
I didn't know there was anything that needed working out.
LAUREL
Didn't you two have words?
ARNOLD
None we haven't used before.
LAUREL
Oh. I thought that was why you returned last night instead of this morning.
ARNOLD
Not at all.
LAUREL
What happened between Alan and Ed doesn't bother you at all?
ED
You blurted it out just like that?
LAUREL
I thought he knew. I meant it as a friendly remark.
ARNOLD
With friends like her who needs newspapers?
ALAN
I tried to tell you.
ARNOLD
I must say, you picked a great time to start telling the truth.
LAUREL
Why did you think I left?
ARNOLD
I thought it was something I said.
LAUREL
Don't be silly.
ALAN
Are you going to tell Laurel?
ED
What I do is my own business.
LAUREL
We respect each other's privacy.
ARNOLD
. . . and he still had energy for me. Oh, to be eighteen again! But, you and Alan didn't. . .
LAUREL
No! Why? He said we did?
ARNOLD
Well, I'm sure he meant it as a compliment... to both of you.
ALAN
I thought an open relationship meant that you told each other everything.
ARNOLD
You saw them together?
LAUREL
No. Ed told me about it after you left. He came into the bedroom and said he had something to discuss . . . discuss?! And he told me. He was crying. He said he was sorry. Not that he'd done it, but that he had to tell me about it. I was dumbfounded. I didn't know which of us to comfort; who was hurting more. So, I sat there. We didn't say a word, occasionally catching each other's eye and looking away again. After a while he went down to the kitchen and I packed a bag and left. I hadn't planned on leaving . . . but, it seemed the right thing to do. There I was, packed, at the door ... so I left.
ARNOLD
That wasn't very bright.
LAUREL
And what would you have done?
ARNOLD
I'd've shoved him headfirst into a meat grinder. But I would've hung around to see what came out the other end.
LAUREL
Arnold, you don't seem to be getting the drift of this at all. He made love to someone; your lover, with me not fifty feet away. What more reason would a person possibly need to walk out on someone?
ARNOLD
I have never felt so used in my life! I wanted to put a pillow over her face and snuff her out. (Mocking) "I hadn't planned on leaving." The gall! "What more reason would a person possibly need to walk out?" The nerve!!
LAUREL
So, this is the Nursery. It's not at all what I'd expected from Ed's description. I like it though. It's got a coziness ... a warmth. I can feel it.
ARNOLD
Thanks.
LAUREL
If this is the Nursery, does that make you the Nurse?
ARNOLD
Registered with the A.M.A. You need one? (Laurel nods and begins to cry) Nurse Arnold to the rescue. (He takes her
LAUREL
Like a claw in my stomach. Just once in my life I'd like to have an affair go on the rocks after the passion wears off; when I'm bored with the routine, the sex, the talk. I'd love to know what it feels like to have the flame rekindled by jealousy instead of this . . . having the rug pulled out from under me like this. Just once I'd like to be standing on sure ground when the blow hits instead of crawling around on my hands and knees like a baby.
ARNOLD
You want a hell of a lot out of life. Don'tcha? I'd settle for being able to say to someone, "I love you," and, whether I meant it or not, finding them still in bed the next morning.
ALAN
All you had to do was ask me.
ARNOLD
Ask you what?
ALAN
Not to fool around with anyone else, and I wouldn't have.
LAUREL
But you never asked me.
ED
Because I wanted you to feel that you could.
ALAN
You mean, you wanted me to feel that you could. All those nights you spent out in them backrooms
ARNOLD
That's not the same thing at all. I didn't even know those people's names.
ALAN
That makes a difference?
LAUREL
You mean, you want me to see other men?
ARNOLD
No. But I want you to feel free to.
ALAN
I do. And I did. So, what are you so upset about?
ED
It's the kind of relationship you said you wanted.
LAUREL
Just because I said that's what I want doesn't mean
ALAN
You're being ridiculous.
ARNOLD
You telling me that you don't see any difference between my innocent jaunts to the backroom and your vile debauchery this weekend?
ALAN
Not really.
ARNOLD
Well. There you have it!
ALAN
There I have what?
ARNOLD
Don't be such a smart-ass!
LAUREL
It's my own fault for expecting something different. The only thing different about each of the affairs in my life is the way they dumped me. Not even the way so much as the words.
ARNOLD
I know what you mean. My favorite kiss-offs are those little speeches
LAUREL
I much prefer the Continental version
ARNOLD
How about, "Let's not make any promises we'll regret later?"
LAUREL
You ever hear the one about the trial separation?
ARNOLD
As often as I've heard about their reconciliation.
LAUREL
"I've got to try my wings."
ARNOLD
"I've got to repark the car."
LAUREL
"I've got to live free!"
ARNOLD
"She meant nothing to me!" Oops. Sorry.
LAUREL
That's all right. It's nothing I haven't heard before.
ARNOLD
Gee, but it's GREAT to have someone else to blame. (They both laugh.)
LAUREL
I don't understand; how could Ed ever have let you get away?
ARNOLD
I'm lousy in bed. It's true. I don't relax enough. I guess I'm just an old-fashioned kind of guy
LAUREL
I don't know. What do you think?
ARNOLD
I think I'm the wrong person to ask.
ALAN
That's the first thing you've said all week that's made sense.
ARNOLD
Look who's talking.
LAUREL
I should at least give him a chance to explain.
ALAN
She'll stay with him. They were made for each other.
LAUREL
I owe him as much.
ARNOLD
It's wrong.
LAUREL
After all, what have I got to lose.
ARNOLD
It's all wrong.
LAUREL
Otherwise . . . what was it all for?
ARNOLD
I can't tell you how strongly I feel that it's wrong! (They are alone in the light.) You were wrong to do what you did! . . . Though I know why you did. And Ed was wrong to do what he did! . . . Though I know why he did. And Laurel was wrong to use what you two did!! . . . Though I know why she did. And I was wrong to do everything I did! . . . But I did. I don't know, maybe it all evens out in the end. I mean, if two wrongs don't make a right. . . maybe four do.
ALAN
So the score's all evened up.
ARNOLD
I can't tell with these "Make-'em-up-as-you-go-along" rules. Monogamy's a much easier system to keep track of.
ALAN
Well, look at it this way
ARNOLD
With a million new fascinating problems to discuss with her shrink.
ALAN
And we've got what we want. . . each other.
ARNOLD
You're awful pushy for a kid who ain't old enough to pee straight.
ALAN
Come here and I'll show you how pushy.
ARNOLD
Just let me turn out the lights.
ALAN
Why do you wanna turn out the lights?
ARNOLD
Because, even in times like these one must retain a degree of the old cherished decorum.
ALAN
Well, aren't we civilized.
ARNOLD
Terribly!
ALAN
Wait. There's one more thing I'd like to ask you.
ARNOLD
The answer is yes.
ALAN
But you don't know the question.
ARNOLD
Doesn't matter. I'm too tired to argue about anything so whatever it is, the answer is yes.
ALAN
Good. Because I love you too.
ARNOLD
Oh, for God's sake, Alan, after everything we've been through this weekend . . .
ALAN
Oh, shut up! (Embarrassed) Can't you take a joke?
A SLIDE
EPILOGUE
ARNOLD
That oughta fog up their glasses and empty their mugs. We'll use it between "Cry Me a River" and "Who's Sorry Now?" Just as a change of pace.
LAUREL
God, you're depressing.
ARNOLD
Laurel? Oh, no!
LAUREL
Thanks a lot.
ARNOLD
No, I didn't mean
LAUREL
Oh, no
ARNOLD
Really?
LAUREL
You say that like you don't believe it.
ARNOLD
Oh, no.
LAUREL
Let's not start that again. Aren't you going to say hello?
ARNOLD
Hello. Sorry, but this just ain't my day. My maid called in sick, my cleaning came in late, we've got these new numbers to rehearse . . .
LAUREL
Maybe I'd better not bother you.
ARNOLD
No, stay. I could use a little gossip in the midst of all this reality. (To pianist) Five minutes, hon. (Taking a chair off a little table) Here, make yourself at home.
LAUREL
Oh, the man in front asked me to give you this. (She hands him a small parcel.)
ARNOLD
Thanks. Here, sit down.
LAUREL
You really like that?
ARNOLD
What?
LAUREL
Songs about suicide, lost love, growing old disgracefully.
ARNOLD
Pays the rent.
LAUREL
Funny, but I always imagined you'd sing comic songs. Y'know, novelty numbers.
ARNOLD
I'm strictly Torch. While all the other kids were listening to the Beatles, Sam the Sham, and the Dave Clark Five, I was home lip-synching Billie Holiday, Jane Froman, and Helen Morgan. As I got older I switched to Lucia di Lammer-moor, Tosca, and Manon. But it was always tragic stuff. Something about taking all that misery and making it into something. . . . Anyway, the audiences like it. I guess getting hurt is one thing we all have in common.
LAUREL
You sound like one of your songs.
ARNOLD
I am one of my songs. (Taking out a leash and collar from the package) Oh, look, it's my wedding present to Alan.
LAUREL
And you told me you weren't into that stuff.
ARNOLD
It's for Alan's dog.
LAUREL
I didn't know he had a dog.
ARNOLD
He doesn't. But he will tomorrow when I give him one.
LAUREL
You got him a dog? What kind?
ARNOLD
Well, y'know they say that a dog grows to look like its master, or that a master grows to look like his dog ... so, I got him a big, fat, home-loving Saint Bernard. It should be quite a battle.
LAUREL
Perfect. So, you two are getting married?
ARNOLD
As married as two men can illegally get. Actually it's more of a contract-signing party. After that weekend the four of us spent together we decided to draw up a few rules and regulations, just so we'd know where we stood with each other. Well, we've spent our every waking, nonworking hour on this document and we're finally ready to sign it. (Holds up a rolled-up piece of parchment)
LAUREL
That's wonderful. May I see it? (She opens it.) It's one sentence long.
ARNOLD
Well, we had a little trouble agreeing on some issues. This is sort of a basic working philosophy which we can amend and elaborate on as we feel necessary.
LAUREL
"We, Arnold and Alan, being of sound mind and social-diseaseless bodies, hereby swear to take equal responsibility for walking and feeding the dog."
ARNOLD
Like I said, it's just a basis. Anyway, the ceremony's tomorrow after the show and we'd love for you to come.
LAUREL
I wish we'd known. But we've already made plans to take care of a few important things. Which brings me to my reason for coming to see you.
ARNOLD
. . . always a reason.
LAUREL
You know, now that it's time I don't know how to say it.
ARNOLD
Sounds serious.
ARNOLD
Be blunt.
LAUREL
Ed and I are engaged to be married.
ARNOLD
Oh.
LAUREL
You and Alan, Ed and me. Kind of ironic, huh?
ARNOLD
That's the word for it. Well, congratulations. I'm sure you two will be very happy together.
LAUREL
Thank you.
ARNOLD
When was all this decided?
LAUREL
I guess about the same time you were drawing up your contract. We talked a lot when I went back to the farm; about what we wanted out of a relationship, what we wanted from each other . . . and we figured after that weekend . . . well, if we could get through a thing like that and still be together, then we could get through anything. Even marriage.
ARNOLD
I could hardly say I didn't expect it, but I could hardly say I did expect it. . . . What I could say is that I'm happy for you. Hey, I'm gonna call Ed right now. . . .
LAUREL
I'd rather you didn't. Ed doesn't know I'm here. As a matter of fact, he's planning on coming by tonight to tell you himself. And I'd like to ask you not to mention my visit. After all, he did want to tell you first.
ARNOLD
Then why did you tell me?
LAUREL
I don't know. That's not true. I was scared that you'd say something negative. Make fun of him or try to talk him out of it. Arnold, everything's going so well between us, but Ed is still shaky. And the wrong word from you . . .
ARNOLD
That's ridiculous.
LAUREL
No, it's realistic.
ARNOLD
You're just being silly. Really you are. The two of you will get married and live happily ever after and I'm very happy
LAUREL
Oh, it would mean so much to both of us to have you there, but the wedding is at my parents' home in Massachusetts and . . . it's really going to be small ... so we're limiting the guests to just immediate family.
ARNOLD
That's all right; I look terrible in green.
LAUREL
I'm sorry, really. Well, I'd better let you get back to your rehearsal. I've kept you long enough. It was wonderful seeing you again. And as soon as we get set up we'll have you over for dinner or something.
ARNOLD
Sure. We'd love that.
LAUREL
You won't say anything to Ed?
ARNOLD
My wrists are sealed.
LAUREL
Pardon?
ARNOLD
An old fag joke.
LAUREL
Well, bye-bye. Give my best to Alan. (Laurel exits and Arnold returns to piano.)
ARNOLD
Hey, Max, you know "The Wedding March"? Never mind. Let's try the closing number.
SO I
Go blow it out your shoe. I can't live on love alone. Want somebody all my own. I can't live on love alone. You can argue but it's true, Three can't live as cheap as two. I can't live on love alone. Fidelity is out of fashion, Variety is everybody's passion. Drugs can keep you copulating till you cash in. And when you're through they'll bury you with your wife. One-night stands are not my quarry, I signed up for repertory. No, I won't live on love alone. Keep my number by the phone Call me if you should atone. But I can't live, no I can't live ... on love alone. (The lights fade to black.)

RADIO
It's seven-eighteen in the Big Apple and this is Hi Tide wishin' you a good, good Mornin'. (A chorus of singers twitter, "Good Morning, Good Morning, Good Morning to you!") And now for ali you sleepyheads what just can't shake them nighttime blues, number one on our hot-pick chart and guaranteed to raise the dead . . . Edward O. Wilson's "I Was Born This Way, What's Your Excuse." (Music begins.)
ED
There's a thought to start the day.
DAVID
Arnold? You got anything I could put on my eye?
ED
He's in the bedroom.
DAVID
What?
ED
Arnold's still in the bedroom.
DAVID
Never mind, I found somethin'.
ED
Arnold, you up? Breakfast is on the table.
DAVID
What?
ED
I was talking to Arnold. (An explosion in the kitchen)
ARNOLD
What the hell was that?
ED
I think the coffee's ready.
ARNOLD
And a "Good Morning, Good Morning, Good Morning to you." You're making breakfast? Aren't you an angel. Smells terrible.
ED
My specialty
ARNOLD
Toast for me, I'm on a diet.
ED
Since when?
ARNOLD
Since I heard the specialty. (Yelling down hall) David, you up yet?
ED
He's in the throne room.
ARNOLD
Hurry up, Sugar-Puss, you'll be late for school.
ED
You look well-rested.
ARNOLD
I feel like freeze-dried death. (Sees mess) Ed, since when do you make coffee in a pressure cooker?
ED
The water boils faster.
DAVID
Everybody ready? Stand back from the door and hang onto your apron strings 'cause here I come. (Enters modeling a three-piece suit) Well? Whatcha think?
ARNOLD
What's the occasion? Ms. Schnable isn't due till next week.
DAVID
But your mother is due today. Think she'll like me?
ARNOLD
Who'd dare not like my baby?
DAVID
And look, I put some gook on. You can't even see the black eye.
ARNOLD
When I think of that kid hitting you, I wanna tear down to that school and beat the shit outta him.
ED
Your maternal instincts are incredible.
DAVID
I can take care of myself.
ARNOLD
I see.
DAVID
Would you stop.
ED
What'd the two of you fight about anyway?
DAVID
He called me something I didn't like, so I slugged him. (Helping Arnold fold the couch)
ED
So how'd you end up with the black eye?
DAVID
I didn't slug him fast enough.
ARNOLD
That's my son, The Champ.
DAVID
That's me, Champ David.
ED
What was it he called you?
DAVID
A douche bag.
ARNOLD
How fifties.
ED
Soup's on!
ARNOLD
You stay away from that kid today. I ain't got no money to buy no new suit.
DAVID
He's somethin', ain't he? What's with this dentist music? (Switches to rock station. It is the same song only discoed.) Much better.
ED
May I seat you, sir?
DAVID
Don't mind if you do. (Sits) What died in here?
ED
Breakfast. (Holding plate over David's head) I cooked it myself. Any complaints?
DAVID
From me? Are you kidding? You know me, always ready for a gastronomic adventure. (Ed sets down plate.) Looks wonderful. Could you pass the salt? How'd you sleep?
ED
The couch and I aren't speaking.
DAVID
It's only your fourth night. You'll get used to it. Could
ED
I'll probably be able to find a place by the weekend.
DAVID
What's your rush? Can I have the ketchup? It's great having you here. Could you pass the mustard?
ED
Something wrong with the food?
DAVID
Not at all. Very tasty. Can I have the mayo, please? (Ed shoots a look.) Hold the mayo. (Tastes it) Mmmmmm. Delicious. Oh, I forgot, your wife called.
ED
When?
DAVID
Middle of the night. I tried to wake you but you were out of it. I told her you'd call back in the morning.
ED
What time did she call?
DAVID
Musta been around two. Somethin' about some papers for you to sign.
ED
Thanks. I'd better call. Help yourself to seconds, there's plenty.
DAVID
And I was worried. (Ed goes to phone.) You sure are a heavy sleeper. The phone rang five times.
ED
What were you doing up so late?
DAVID
Answering the phone.
ED
Hello, Laurel? What's up? . . . Couldn't that have waited till morning? ... I don't think it's fair to wake the whole house. . . .
ARNOLD
Hey, Champ, remember to bring back your report card. I signed it.
DAVID
Where'd you put it?
ARNOLD
By the door.
DAVID
Is Ms. Schnable really coming next week?
ARNOLD
Every third Thursday for the next three months. So stay outta trouble and pray that eye heals. I wish this damned probation period was over already. Gives me the creeps havin' someone check up on us all the time.
DAVID
What's the rush? When the adoption papers come through we stop gettin' the foster-care checks and we need the money.
ARNOLD
You may find this hard to believe, but I didn't take you in for the money.
DAVID
Then you're the first.
ARNOLD
Who's on the phone?
DAVID
Ed.
ARNOLD
I thought I recognized the voice.
ED
. . . Laurel, I wish you wouldn't. . . . Not on the phone!
ARNOLD
There's nothing more frustrating than a one-sided conversation.
DAVID
There's another kind?
ED
... I really don't want to discuss this now. . . . Because, there are other people in the room.
DAVID
Don't mind us. (Arnold swats him.)
ED
... Can we please talk about this later? . . . Hello? . . . Laurel, are you there? . . . For God's sake, are you crying?
ARNOLD
Animal.
ED
Laurel, please. I'll come over and we can talk. ... I don't know when. This afternoon. I don't know. ... All right, I'll see you then. . . . Bye-bye. (Hangs up)
DAVID
She gave you a hard time, huh? (Arnold swats him again.) Ow! That hurt.
ARNOLD
Want some coffee?
ED
No, I'm fine. After four days of those calls I think I'm getting used to them. I mean, I understand why she calls; she's confused, alone . . . What I can't understand is her damned crying.
ARNOLD
Of course it's just a wild guess, but do you suppose it's because she's confused and alone?
ED
Well, I don't see why. This separation wasn't all my idea.
ARNOLD
Look, Ed, I realize this is a trying time for you and I'll gladly supply a place to sleep, a home-thrown meal, and all the amoral support I can muster, but you've got to keep the gory details to yourself.
ED
Ah, what price compassion?!!
ARNOLD
Fifty bucks an hour and I don't take credit cards.
ED
Fifty?
ARNOLD
Hey, talk's cheap, but listening'll cost ya. Buck up, Bronco, things are bound to get easier.
ED
Oh, I know. I just wish she wouldn't carry on like that. You wouldn't believe the crazy accusations she was making. . . .
ARNOLD
Ed, I'm serious. I really don't want to hear about it.
ED
Some friend you are.
ARNOLD
I'm your ex-lover, Ed, not your friend.
DAVID
Oooooh. The heavy stuff. And it ain't even eight o'clock.
ARNOLD
Don't talk with your mouth full.
DAVID
But my mouth's . . . (Arnold glares.) Is full. Very full.
ARNOLD
I didn't say that to be mean. Really. But I can't help remembering a phone call not unlike that one from someone in this very room, if you get my drift.
ED
Didn't think of that.
ARNOLD
Well, do. Please do. And please don't ask for any advice, 'cause you don't want to hear what I have to say.
DAVID
Heartbreaker. (Arnold glares.) I'm eating. I'm eating.
ARNOLD
All this and my mother too.
ED
Well, I'll see Laurel this afternoon and hopefully end these midnight calls.
ARNOLD
That would be lovely. And while you're there could you see if she'd mind letting you stay with her Wednesday night? The Department of Child Welfare will be arriving early in the person of Our Ms. Schnable and I've got enough to explain without you on the couch.
ED
I'm good enough for your mother but not for David's social worker?
ARNOLD
It has nothing to do with being good enough. Ms. Schnable frowns on casual cohabitation.
ED
Casual? We've known each other for six years.
ARNOLD
Four of which you spent married to another woman. (To David) Take a glass of milk.
ED
I get it, it's not me she'll object to but my bisexuality.
ARNOLD
Could we please leave your perverted preferences unpurposed this joyous morn?
ED
Bigot!
ARNOLD
Reactionary Chickenshit!
DAVID
Please, not in front of the child.
ED
I could lie and tell her I'm gay.
ARNOLD
Come on.
ED
Don't you think I could make a convincing homosexual?
DAVID
You could make this convincing homosexual.
ARNOLD
David! Besides, if she thought you were gay, she'd never believe you slept on the couch.
ED
I could show you the scars.
ARNOLD
I could show you the door.
DAVID
I could show you a good time.
ED AND ARNOLD
David!!
DAVID
Well, I'd love to sit and chat with you grown-up types, but we straight-C students pride ourselves on our punk-tuality.
ARNOLD
Go brush your teeth.
DAVID
Oh, Maaaaaaaa!
ARNOLD
Don't you "Oh, Ma" me. March. And don't call me Ma in front of my mother. (David exits. Ed giggles.) Having a good time?
ED
Sorry, but you do act like his mother.
ARNOLD
Guess I do. But this parent act's still new to me. I can't quite get the hang of being mother, father, friend, and confessor all rolled into one.
ED
You're doin' great.
ARNOLD
Think so?
ED
You're the best mother-father-friend-confessor I've ever seen. You've just got to let go a little more.
ARNOLD
I will. Geez, I can't wait for my mother to get here; I can mother-smother David, she can mother-smother me . . .
ED
And I can mother-smother referee.
ARNOLD
Laugh now, Leroy, but we're gonna need one. Y'know, this stuff smells awful, but it tastes much worse.
ED
Be nice or I'll tell people it's your recipe.
ARNOLD
You don't have to threaten me twice.
ED
I'm enjoying being here with you and David enormously. I want you to know that.
ARNOLD
Good.
ED
You ever wonder what things would be like if I'd never met Laurel?
ARNOLD
That all depends, did I meet Alan?
ED
Of course not. If I didn't meet Laurel you wouldn't have met Alan.
ARNOLD
Oh. So that's how it works. Well, did I adopt David?
ED
That's what I'm asking. Would we have stayed together and would we have adopted David?
ARNOLD
How should I know?
ED
Well, didn't you ever wonder?
ARNOLD
Ed, I have enough trouble with the "What nows" without starting in on the "What ifs."
ED
Yeah, but haven't you ever thought about what things would be like if we'd stayed together?
ARNOLD
I guess so. When Alan died I thought about a lot of crazy things. I'm sure you were among them.
ED
And?
ARNOLD
I don't know. Why, what do you think?
ED
I think we might've been very happy together. It's possible.
ARNOLD
It's also possible that it could be me you just walked out on.
ED
I didn't just walk out. And who just said they didn't want to discuss this?
ARNOLD
Who's discussing? I'm simply pointing out a certain pattern a certain person seems to have fallen into.
ED
People do make mistakes.
ARNOLD
I wanna write that down.
ED
... and sometimes they are even forgiven for them.
ARNOLD
Oh, don't be so melodramatic. I forgave you years ago. I don't think I could've been happy with Alan if I hadn't.
ED
Maybe you and your mother should spend some time alone. I can still find a hotel.
ARNOLD
You're staying here and that's an order. You wouldn't leave me unprotected at a time like this, would you? Of course you would. But you ain't gonna. My mother isn't going to feature the idea of my becoming a father, and your professional opinion as an American educator will prove invaluable.
ED
She'll say I'm prejudiced.
ARNOLD
She'll say a lot of things. You'll learn not to listen. More coffee?
ED
Please.
ARNOLD
(Making coffee and cleaning up) My mother's all right. Basically. When I was a kid we had a healthy Mother/Son relationship. A delicate blend of love, concern, and guilt. We never talked much but when we did we kept things on an honest level. I mean, I told her I was gay when I was thirteen.
ED
You knew when you were thirteen?
ARNOLD
When I was thirteen I knew everything. Senility set in sometime after. And look at me now
DAVID
Don't rush an artist.
ARNOLD
What was I saying?
ED
Something about your mother.
ARNOLD
My mother
ED
It's called Adult Conversation.
ARNOLD
Thank you, Tom Snyder. Where was I?
ED
Your mother.
ARNOLD
My mother
ED
She knew Alan?
ARNOLD
Oh, yeah. And they got along as long as I didn't call him my lover. She preferred to call him my "Friend." Anyway, she retired, moved to Florida, which reduced our relationship to weekly phone calls and biannual visitations. And then Alan died and I was expected to observe the same vow of silence about him as she had about my father. So we've learned to make meaningful conversation from the weather, general health, and my brother's marital status. I never even told her how Alan was killed. She assumed it was a car accident and I didn't bother correcting her.
ED
So now you don't know how to tell her about David.
ARNOLD
Oh, she knows about David. But she assumed he was my roommate and I . . .
ED
... you didn't bother correcting her.
ARNOLD
It's not the telling that frightens me. But I shake when I think of the long-muzzled floodgates of motherly advice that will unleash when she gets wind of this.
ED
How bad could it possibly be?
ARNOLD
Stick around, kid.
DAVID
How's these? (Big smile) And look, I'm taking the brush with me so's I can give them a swipe before my big entrance. Think Granny'll be impressed?
ARNOLD
David, you can put your elbows on the table, use vile and abusive language, even pass gas loudly during conversation. But whatever you do . . . don't call her Granny!
DAVID
You could save yourself a load of grief if you'd just let me break the good news to her.
ARNOLD
Thanks, but I've heard your subtle mouth at work.
DAVID
Don't say I didn't offer. (Phone rings) I'll get it.
ED
You want tea?
ARNOLD
Why not?
DAVID
Sister Arnold's House of Hope. You pay, we pray. Brother David speaking.
ARNOLD
Give me that. Hello? . . . Oh, hi, Murray. . . . No, that was David's idea of discretion.
DAVID
Think I have a future in the Diplomatic Corps?
ARNOLD
Hang on a sec. (To David) Don't you ever answer the phone like that again. What if this was Ms. Schnable? Have you got a comb? (Heproduces one.) A handkerchief? (He moans.) March!
ED
A handkerchief? Really, Arnold.
DAVID
What the hell is this? (Reads from card) "I'm proud of his improvement and am sure he'll do even better on his finals."
ARNOLD
It said "Parent's Comments" and I had to write something.
DAVID
No you didn't. (Storms to bedroom)
ARNOLD
Murray, can I call you back after I get my little men off to work? Okay, I'll call . . . David! Hang up that extension! . . . No, you can't have a divorce. We're not married. . . . Murray? I'll call you back. (Hangs up) All right, what'd I do wrong now?
ED
The kids like to brag that they forged their parents' signatures. But if there's a sensible comment like that then everyone will know it's the real thing.
ARNOLD
How was I supposed to know? God, he makes me feel old.
ED
Don't worry about it. What time is the Great Arrival?
ARNOLD
I don't know. I figure around noon.
DAVID
I'm gettin' outta here before you think of something else.
ARNOLD
Where are your schoolbooks?
DAVID
In school.
ARNOLD
How'd you do your homework?
DAVID
Astral projection.
ARNOLD
You forgetting something?
DAVID
What now?
ARNOLD
Don't I get a kiss good-bye?
DAVID
You're unreal. (Warm hug and kiss) I love you.
ARNOLD
Me too. Now, get outta here. You're late.
DAVID
Have a nice day, Ed. You too . . . Ma. (Out)
ED
Men kissing. What's this world coming to?
ARNOLD
My father and brother and I all kissed. It's called affection. Aren't you going to work?
ED
It's Brooklyn Day. My school's closed.
ARNOLD
Only the Brooklyn schools?
ED
And Queens.
ARNOLD
Queens too? Sounds like Affirmative Action at work. (Sees Ed clearing dishes) That's all right. I'll do them.
ED
Then I'll go for the papers. Maybe I'll get a lead on an apartment.
ARNOLD
Hurry back. I ain't facin' her alone. Do you and your mother get along?
ED
Sure. No problem. That is, as long as I remember to call her every now and then. And send her a card on her Birthday. And Mother's Day. And Christmas. Oh, and of course there's Valentine's Day, and St. Patrick's Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Easter, Fourth of July, Election Day, and Christopher Columbus's Birthday.
ARNOLD
You forgot Halloween.
ED
That's her Anniversary.
ARNOLD
How romantic.
ED
Where's my bluejacket?
ARNOLD
My room, left side. (Ed exits.) Ed? You ever tell your folks you were gay?
ED
But I'm not.
ARNOLD
All right, bisexual. Don't be so technical. I ain't Kinsey.
ED
No.
ARNOLD
Never?
ED
You need anything from the store?
ARNOLD
Wait a minute. I mean, I know you were in the closet when we were together, but I figured once you got married you'd feel secure enough to tell them.
ED
Once I got married there was nothing to tell them. (Defensive) And I wasn't in the closet.
ARNOLD
Ed, when the only people who know you're gay are the ones you're gaying with, that's called in the closet.
ED
Arnold, you may enjoy broadcasting your sexual preferences but I happen to believe that who I sleep with is my business and not the world's.
ARNOLD
We'll discuss the world later, I'm asking about your mother.
ED
Why put them through that?
ARNOLD
Through what?
ED
Making them feel that in some way they failed me or did something wrong. You know the trip.
ARNOLD
But you could explain to them that they had nothing to do with it. Well, not that way, anyway.
ED
They'd still be miserable. Besides, I really don't think it's any of their business.
ARNOLD
You told them about Laurel, didn't you?
ED
We were married.
ARNOLD
You lived together for a year first. You sayin' they didn't know about her till after the wedding?
ED
Arnold, you told your parents, they accepted it, and I'm very happy for all of you. All right? Jesus. Your mother flies in for a visit and I get a Gay Consciousness-Raising lecture.
ARNOLD
You have a Prim-Evil attitude about your sexuality, Mr. Reiss.
ED
Enough?
ARNOLD
And they wonder why we broke up.
ED
Arnold, you have nothing to worry about. Believe me, your
ARNOLD
You really think I'm doing good with him?
ED
You've taken a punk kid who's spent the last three years on the streets and in juvenile court and turned him into a home-living, fun-loving, school-going teenager in all of six months. Yes, I think you're doing good with him.
ARNOLD
I wish Alan was here. He woulda been great with the kid.
ED
I'll see you later.
ARNOLD
Don't be too long.
ED
Give me an hour.
ARNOLD
See ya. (Runs to door) Ed? We need milk! Skimmed!! (The phone rings. Arnold grunts and answers.)
ARNOLD
Hello? . . . Oh, hi, Murray. . . . Not much. The usual assortment of early-morning crises. What's up by you?
ED
Arnold, she's here!
ARNOLD
Hang on, Murr. (To Ed) What?
ED
She's here. She's headed up the stairs.
ARNOLD
Can't be. It's too early.
ED
There's a woman on the stairs checking all the apartment numbers.
ARNOLD
What'd she look like?
ED
This tall, this wide, carrying a suitcase and a shopping bag.
ARNOLD
Mayday, Murray! I'll call you back.
ED
Calm down, Arnold. (As Arnold runs around the room)
ARNOLD
She can't see the place looking like this. She'll walk through the door and head straight for the vacuum cleaner.
MA
Well, I might change my shoes first.
ARNOLD
Ma. Hi. Come on in.
MA
Hello. You must be David.
ED
No, I'm Ed.
MA
How do you do. I'm the mother.
ARNOLD
I really didn't expect you this early.
MA
Obviously.
ED
Well, I've got to be off. Lovely meeting you, Mrs. Beckoff. I'll remember the milk. (Out. Then back in.) Skimmed. (Out)
MA
Nice-looking boy. Who is he?
ARNOLD
That's Ed. . . .
MA
That's enough—for now I'm sorry I snapped at him but that bus ride from the airport. ... I had to stand the whole way. There wasn't a man on that bus would give me his seat. I'm telling you, Arnold, Women's Liberation is giving me varicose veins. So, let me look at you. How do you feel. You look good.
ARNOLD
Good compared to the last time you saw me.
MA
The last time I saw you was at your friend's funeral. You're supposed to look lousy at funerals; it shows respect. You could stand a shave.
ARNOLD
I just got up. Coffee?
MA
A glass of tea. And a can of Lysol. What's that stench?
ARNOLD
Ed cooked breakfast.
MA
So I know he's not the cook. Pretty wallpaper.
ARNOLD
It's not wallpaper. I stenciled the design.
MA
Next time use wallpaper. Covers a multitude of sins. Looks
ARNOLD
The other place had one bedroom. We needed two.
MA
I thought your roommate's name was David.
ARNOLD
It is. He isn't here right now.
MA
Three men, two bedrooms . . . I'll have my tea first.
ARNOLD
Ed's transitory. The sofa's a convertible. Honey?
MA
Lemon. I brought my own Sweet 'n Low . . . from the plane. You don't get much light here.
ARNOLD
We get what you call "indirect semishade." It's good for the plants.
MA
So's manure. Looks comfortable. How do you find the roaches?
ARNOLD
I turn on the lights. (A little laugh at his little joke)
MA
Arnold, when a man's with his friends he makes wife jokes. When he's with his wife he makes mother jokes. And when he's with his mother ... he lets her make the jokes. (Arnold gets the message.) You speak to your brother?
ARNOLD
He was over for dinner last week.
MA
He brought a girl?
ARNOLD
Andrea.
MA
He's still seeing her? Any talk of marriage?
ARNOLD
You'll see him tomorrow, you can ask yourself.
MA
And be accused of meddling? Bite your tongue.
ARNOLD
Are you getting shorter?
MA
No, I'm sitting down. So, who's this Ed?
ARNOLD
A friend. Tell me about Florida. Anyone special in your life?
MA
Not particularly. You mean Ed's a friend-friend or a euphemism-friend?
ARNOLD
He used to be a euphemism, now he's just a friend. Why aren't you seeing anyone?
MA
Because the only ones who ask me out are old men and the one thing I don't need is to become a nursemaid for some alter kocker.
ARNOLD
Don't you meet any men your own age?
MA
In Miami Beach? If he's not your friend why's he cooking your breakfast?
ARNOLD
You never cook for your friends?
MA
Not breakfast. Didn't you used to have a friend named Ed who got married?
ARNOLD
You've got a great tan.
MA
He's a teacher?
ARNOLD
And a great memory.
MA
The girl was, too, right? They've got a house in the country.
ARNOLD
Incredible.
MA
I remember thinking, "Now there'a a man with his head on straight." What's he doing cooking your breakfast?
ARNOLD
He and his wife have separated. He's staying here till he can find a place of his own.
MA
Separated? How come?
ARNOLD
I don't know.
MA
Come on, the man's living with you. He must've said something.
ARNOLD
I didn't ask and he didn't volunteer.
MA
You're involved?
ARNOLD
No!
MA
Arnold?
ARNOLD
Ma?
MA
So why's he staying here?
ARNOLD
Because he asked if he could and I said yes.
MA
You must admit, it sounds a little queer
ARNOLD
He's spending a few nights on my couch. What's the big deal?
MA
No big deal. But, you'd think he'd stay by friends that have more in common.
ARNOLD
What does that mean?
MA
You know; someone he met after the marriage.
ARNOLD
Maybe he needed to get away from all of that.
MA
You mean he's still? . . . (Makes a motion with her hand)
ARNOLD
Can we talk about the weather now?
MA
I'm glad you reminded me. (Heads for her shopping bag) Your mother! If I didn't have my head screwed on ... I baked you some cookies. (Produces a tin) Fresh from the Sunshiney State. Take a whiff; you can smell Miami.
ARNOLD
David'll love these.
MA
I didn't know what to bring. I hadn't seen the place to know what you need.
ARNOLD
Oh, I didn't show you. . . . (Takes out an afghan) Look what I'm making. I took a class in weaving and crocheting at night school. Isn't it beautiful?
MA
I'm telling you! . . .
ARNOLD
I made it for out here. Y'know, for taking a nap on the couch. I wanna make one for my bedroom too. You like it?
MA
Nice.
ARNOLD
Pretty design, huh?
MA
It's fairy nice.
ARNOLD
Well, maybe you should unpack. You can put your things in my room.
MA
How are we arranging all of this?
ARNOLD
You'll sleep in my room, David in his room, and Ed and I can share the couch.
MA
Wouldn't it be easier if I slept on the couch? That way you'll have your privacy.
ARNOLD
We don't need privacy.
MA
How about if you shared David's room?
ARNOLD
Did you see my cigarettes around?
MA
You still smoke? Shame on you. (Arnold heaves a heavy sigh.) What's the matter, shayner boyalah? You didn't sleep good?
ARNOLD
I'm fine. Just give me a minute to get myself together.
MA
Go on, get yourself together. I could use a get-together myself. (Deep breath) Arnold, where's the dog? He didn't come to say hello.
ARNOLD
I had to give him away. He used to sit by the door and whine all day and night, waiting for Alan to come home. I couldn't take it so I gave him to Murray. (Referring to stack of papers she has unpacked) What's all that?
MA
Don't ask me why, they forwarded some of your mail to me.
ARNOLD
Anything I should know about?
MA
Garbage. But there's a letter from Ernie the insurance man. You canceled your policy?
ARNOLD
One of them.
MA
You need money? You know I'm always good for a loan.
ARNOLD
Thanks but things are fine.
MA
Meanwhile you lost out on a very good deal. You wouldn't see a policy like that again.
ARNOLD
What do I need with a twenty-five-thousand-dollar life insurance policy?
MA
Now you don't need it, but someday? . . . You never know; you might meet a nice girl . . .
ARNOLD
Maaaa!
MA
You never know. Look at your friend Ed.
ARNOLD
I'm looking. He's separated.
MA
Separated, but not divorced. Believe me, you never know.
ARNOLD
Believe me. I know.
MA
What's the matter; you don't want children?
ARNOLD
Not the kind you mean.
MA
The kind I mean have two arms, two legs, a mother, father, and Chicken Pox. How many kinds are there?
ARNOLD
You'd be surprised.
MA
Arnold, you and your brother are the last of the Beckoffs.
ARNOLD
So?
MA
Don't you feel you have a duty to continue the family name?
ARNOLD
Not particularly. Anyway, there's always my brother. I'm sure there'll be lots of little Beckoffs running around.
MA
And what if he only has girls?
ARNOLD
I know a good surgeon.
MA
I don't get you.
ARNOLD
Why don't you unpack while I take a shower and shave. And when I'm dressed we can sit and have a lonng talk.
MA
A "lonnng" talk? I feel a gray hair growing in.
ARNOLD
It's not that bad. Let me help with your bags.
MA
I can manage.
ARNOLD
It's the room on the right. Shit, I didn't have time to make the bed.
MA
Take your shower. I'll do it.
ARNOLD
There's fresh linen in the closet at the end of the hall.
MA
Go. I'll get by.
ARNOLD
I won't be long. (Exits)
MA
You see, Jack? They still need the old mama. (Exiting) Just think, if I wasn't here . . . who would make the beds?
DAVID
She has arrived. But where are she? (Looks in kitchen, under table, goes to bathroom door, and listens) We got us a live one. (Arnold hums a bit of something.) Wrong one. (He is having fun. He tiptoes to the hall and exits. . . . A moment of silence, then a shriek. David runs out of the hall pursued by Ma, who is swinging at him with her purse.) Mrs. Beckoff, please. I'm not a burglar!
MA
Then what are you; some kind of weirdo who gets a kick watching middle-aged women strip beds?
DAVID
I'm not a weirdo. Believe me.
MA
Then you're a rapist. (She screams again.)
DAVID
What would a rapist be doing in a three-piece suit?
MA
How should I know? Maybe you got a wedding after.
ARNOLD
What the . . . David! What are you doing out of school?
MA
This is your roommate?
DAVID
Charmed, I'm sure.
MA
You know that "lonnng" talk we're gonna have? It just got lonnnnnnnger.
ARNOLD
What are you doing home?
DAVID
I forgot, I had a double period of gym and no uniform. So I tole Mr. Kelley about your mother comin' and he said I could come home till after lunch.
ARNOLD
Just like that?
DAVID
Well . . . you gotta call and say it's okay. Wasn't that nice of him?
ARNOLD
We'll discuss this later. (Trying to smile) Ma, this is David.
MA
So I gathered.
ARNOLD
Okay. So, now we all know each other.
MA
Arnold, you're dripping on my shoe.
ARNOLD
Oh. How about this
DAVID
It's only nine o'clock.
ARNOLD
When I tell you to do something . . . (Catches Ma staring) Well, I'm going to dry off now.
MA
You do that.
ARNOLD
So, you'll unpack, right? You'll make lunch, right? And I'll. . .
MA
Dry up.
ARNOLD
Right. (Takes a last look, crosses himself, and exits)
DAVID
Would you like a drink?
MA
Maybe later. I'm sorry I hit you.
DAVID
No sweat. I usually charge, but seein' how you're family . . . (He laughs.)
MA
You have quite a little sense of humor. Shall we sit down?
DAVID
Sure. (They do.)
MA
Tell me, David, you go to school?
DAVID
Yeah. (Sees cookies) You make these?
MA
Help yourself. (He does, by the handful.) So, you go to college.
DAVID
High school.
MA
High school. How nice. (Hopeful) Senior year?
DAVID
Freshman.
MA
That's very sweet. Tell me, David, just how old are you?
DAVID
Sixteen ... in two months. (Sees her dying) Something wrong?
MA
Not at all. Sixteen ... in two months . . . that's wonderful. You have your whole life ahead of you . . . while mine's flashing before my eyes.
DAVID
Good stuff.
MA
Thank you. David, it's none of my business, of course, but don't you think you're a little young to be out in the world all alone?
DAVID
No. But, the judge did, so here I am.
ARNOLD
Everything all right out here?
MA
Fine, dear. Keep drying. (Arnold withdraws.)
DAVID
You like the place? We cleaned all week for you. Sorry I didn't get back to see your face when you got here.
MA
That face couldn't compare to this one.
DAVID
I woulda taken the whole morning off, but you know Arnold. . . . Hey, he better hurry up and call the school. Mr. Kelley'll think I was jivin' him.
MA
Does Arnold make all your excuses at school?
DAVID
Sure. Who else?
MA
Who else, indeed. I've got an idea
DAVID
Hey, I wore this special for you.
MA
I've seen it, it's cute, now put it away.
DAVID
Yeah, but. . .
MA
March.
DAVID
Now I know where Arnold got his technique.
MA
Cute kid. (Calling out) David? Where do you keep the phone numbers?
DAVID
In the phone book.
MA
A little too cute. Oy, Arnold, what have you got yourself into now? (Finds book) Here it is. Right on top. Must get used a lot. (Starts to dial . . .) David? What name shall I give them?
DAVID
What?
MA
Who shall I say is being excused? (No response) Your last name!
DAVID
Beckoff, of course.
MA
Really? That's quite a coincidence. Have you and Arnold ever compared notes to see if there's any family relation?
DAVID
I'm his son. What more relation could there be? (Arnold steps out of the bathroom.)
MA
You're his what?
DAVID
His son. (Arnold goes right back into the bathroom.) Would you like that drink now?
ED
Hello? Anybody home?
ARNOLD
Deserter! Defector! Duty-dodger! Ditching your post at the first sign of battle, you backstabbing, betraying, ball-breaking Buttercup! How could you leave me unprotected? You Avoider! Abstainer! Abandoner! Absconderer!
ED
Absconderer?
ARNOLD
If the shoe fits . . . Where have you been?
ED
Buying milk.
ARNOLD
For nine hours?
ED
I was on the express line. What happened?
ARNOLD
Happened? What could possibly have happened? My mother walked through that door and within three minutes managed to insult the plane ride, the bus ride, Women's Lib, the apartment, Manhattan, my personal hygiene, sense of humor, afghan, smoking, stenciling, and cockroaches. And, oh, you'll love this
ED
You're kidding.
ARNOLD
She practically called me a homewrecker. Okay, so far so good. We finally sat down to chat when who should walk through the door, but the Patron Saint of Truants himself
ED
Oops.
ARNOLD
Did you say "Oops"? No, Ed. "Oops" is when you fall down an elevator shaft. "Oops" is when you skinny-dip in a school of piranha. "Oops" is for accidentally douching with Drano. No, Ed, this was not an "Oops." This was a (Strangled Scream)l
ED
Cut the dramatics and tell me what happened.
ARNOLD
I'm telling you, nothing happened.
ED
Nothing?
ARNOLD
As in "Not a thing." Dear David went atwitter to his room, mother went to my room, and I sat in the bathroom making toilet-paper flowers and flushing them down the drain. Three hours I flowered and flushed, flowered and flushed, till, Thank God, I ran out of paper. Forced from my Autumn Beige Tiled retreat, I called a truce for lunch. It was eaten in silence. No one even chewed. (You ever gum down a hamburger?) After lunch David announced he was going back to school and my mother volunteered to walk him.
ED
Where are they now?
ARNOLD
I haven't the smoggiest. Knowing David, he's probably fuming over some pinball machine. I was gonna look for him but it's better if he makes it home on his own.
ED
That's very sensible.
ARNOLD
Not at all. But what would I say if I did find him. And the mother ... I don't know where she could be.
ED
"Leave them alone and they'll come home . . ."
ARNOLD
". . . dragging a noose behind them." Help me with dinner.
ED
A quick trip to the men's room and I'll set the table.
ARNOLD
You'll have to borrow a plunger from next door, first. A thousand sheets really do last longer. (Picking up the broken china) Look at this, you broke my favorite platter.
ED
I broke?
ARNOLD
Come on, get going. And don't go disappearing on me again.
ED
I'll be right back. (Exits)
ARNOLD
Hello? . . . Oh, hi, Murray. . . . No, I've been home all day. . . . Because I was in the bathroom. . . . Yes, all day. You wanna sue me? . . . Look, Murr, I ain't got time to tear a herring with you now. You got somethin' to say? Say it. . . . Rocco who? Rocco DiGemma? The one with the Leatherette T-shirts? . . . Yeah, I know him. What about him? . . . You told him I'd do what?!!!? . . . Uh-huh. . . . Uh-huh. . . . Uh-huh.. . .
MA
Who was that, dear?
ARNOLD
It was Murray. He wanted me to do a favor for a friend.
MA
What did he want you to do?
ARNOLD
. . . Baby-sit. You were together?
DAVID
I took your mother to school with me.
MA
They were very nice. They let me sit in the back. He does very well; when he stays awake.
DAVID
Then I took her to play pinball.
MA
You weren't worried, were you?
ARNOLD
What, me worry?
DAVID
Hey, Alfred E., what's for dinner? (Heads to kitchen)
MA
Would you like to go out? My treat.
ARNOLD
I've started dinner here. But if you'd rather . . .
MA
No, we'll go out tomorrow. Besides, my feet are screaming for my slippers.
ED
Well, look who's here.
MA
Hello, Ed. How was your day?
ED
Fine . . . thank you, Mrs. Beckoff. And yours?
MA
Surprisingly pleasant, once it was settled into. (Exiting. To David) After you do your homework I'll teach you how to play chess.
DAVID
Homework? Is she kidding? Hey, Arnold, we got a chess set?
ARNOLD
Top shelf of your closet.
DAVID
Thanks. Hi, Ed. (Exits)
ED
And you were worried. (Goes toward bathroom)
ARNOLD
I wasn't worried. I was concerned. (Ed exits.)
MA
Give me an apron and put me to work.
ARNOLD
That's all right, Ma. Ed's gonna help.
MA
Oh, I wondered what the plunger was for. Listen, if I'm gonna die of ptomaine, it'll be from something I made myself. (Holding up a potato) What do you want done with these?
ARNOLD
I was going to bake them, but if I could twist your arm? . . .
MA
You want my Latkes?
ARNOLD
I'd love your Lathes.
MA
Then you'll get my Lathes.
ED
All fixed.
ARNOLD
Thanks, Ed.
DAVID
Hey, Arnold? I can't find the chessboard.
ARNOLD
Coming. (Exits) Be back.
MA
You like Lathes, Ed?
ED
I don't know. I never had it.
MA
Them. You're in for a treat.
ED
I couldn't help noticing, you've got slippers like Arnold's. Mind if I ask who gave them to whom?
MA
You like my slippers? Aren't they Chick? Arnold gave them to me. You know what they say; in matters of taste, there is none.
ED
I see where Arnold gets his wit.
MA
That and his appetite are from me. But the face? He's his father's son. He's got his heart too. Always a soft touch. Tell me, Ed, what do you think of Arnold taking in this boy?
ED
I think it's wonderful.
MA
You do? Frankly, I'm not wild for it. But look, it's only for a few more weeks, so what harm could it do?
ED
Oops.
MA
Arnold? You have Matzo Meal?
ARNOLD
Yeah, I'll get it for you.
MA
He has Matzo Meal. Did I bring him up right? (David enters with a book, sits down on the couch, and begins to read.)
ARNOLD
Here you go, Ma. You need eggs?
MA
Two, please. And an onion?
ED
Are you doing homework?
DAVID
Nah. I'm just readin' somethin' from school.
MA
Arnold's father used to love my Lathes. But his favorite was my Potato Soup. You remember how he liked it, Arnold?
ARNOLD
I remember.
MA
It wasn't potato soup like you think; made with vegetables and cream. What he liked was
ARNOLD
Yes, Ma.
MA
We were Depression babies. You understand? Whether you have to or not, you carry that through your life. The tastes, the smells . . . they bring back a cozy feeling of a time you don't quite remember. You know what I'm talking?
ED
I think so.
MA
Good. 'Cause I don't. (Arnold hugs her.) What's that for?
ARNOLD
I'm glad you're here.
MA
Me too, Tatalah.
ED
I didn't know you could read.
DAVID
I just look at the pictures.
ED
What is it?
DAVID
Some garbage for English.
ED
What?
DAVID
A poem. I don't know. (Reading and mispronouncing the word "Gaol") "The Ballad of Reading Gaol" by Oscar Wilde.
ED
That's gaol, like in j-a-i-1.
DAVID
That ain't what it says.
ED
That's the British spelling.
ARNOLD
(From memory) "Yet each man kills the thing he loves, By each let this be heard,
ED
Very good.
MA
What? You think I raised a dope?
ARNOLD
We had to learn it in high school. Y'know, I still get shivers when I think of that poor man going through all that pain and torment just to write a cliche.
DAVID
What's a cliche?
ARNOLD
The sincerest form of flattery.
DAVID
Was that a joke?
ARNOLD
Did your teacher happen to mention how Oscar Wilde came to be imprisoned?
DAVID
Maybe. Who listens?
ARNOLD
He was in jail for being gay.
DAVID
No, I think I woulda remembered that.
MA
Arnold, I can't find the oil.
ARNOLD
In a minute, Ma. See, ten years earlier, the Parliament passed a law against homosexuality. And Oscar Wilde had this young lover named . . .
MA
Arnold, could you please give me a hand?
ARNOLD
Just a second. His name was Lord Alfred.
DAVID
Royalty, huh?
ED
Anything I can help you with?
MA
No, thank you, Ed.
ARNOLD
Now, Lord Alfred's father found out about them and started causing scenes in public; chasin' 'em outta hotels and stuff. But the straw that broke the dam was a note sent to Wilde's hotel. It said, "To Oscar Wilde, who poses as a Sodomite."
MA
For God's sake, Arnold. Could you change the subject?
ARNOLD
I'll finish later. (Goes back to kitchen)
ED
Here, we'll read the poem together and I'll explain anything you don't understand.
DAVID
I want the rest of the dish. (Ed kicks him.) Ouch, that hurt.
ARNOLD
I wish you wouldn't interfere like that; it's very embarrassing.
MA
Excuse me, but listening to that is very embarrassing.
ARNOLD
I'm sorry you feel that way, but I have a responsibility to his education.
MA
I am sure that the people who put him here did not have that kind of education in mind.
ARNOLD
The people who put him here had exactly that kind of education in mind. And I'll thank you not to interfere.
MA
I am only suggesting that you should consider the huge responsibility you've taken on here.
ARNOLD
You think I'm unaware of it?
MA
Then act like it. You should be setting an example for the boy.
ARNOLD
And I'm not?
MA
Not when you talk like that, you're not. You've got to
ARNOLD
What's for a few more months?
MA
He's here on a nine-month program, right? And he's already been here six months, so . . .
ARNOLD
And what do you think happens then?
MA
He leaves.
DAVID
No, you misunderstoo— (Ed kicks him again.) Ow! This is getting serious.
ARNOLD
There seems to be a misinterpretation afoot. Yes, David is here on a nine-month program, but after that, if we agree and the Bureau of Child Welfare allows, I will legally adopt David. And believe me, Ma, if I have anything to say about it, he's not leaving.
ARNOLD
That was an "Oops."
ED
I thought so.
ARNOLD
What'd you tell her?
DAVID
I didn't say nothin'.
ARNOLD
You certainly got a way without words. Well, kids, wish me luck.
DAVID
You goin' in there?
ARNOLD
Anybody got any suggestions?
DAVID
Don't look at me.
ED
Sorry, I'm just the baby-sitter.
ARNOLD
Somber times inspire your whimsicality. I'll remember that.
ED
And don't forget to write.
DAVID
We'll be in the next room; so talk loud.
ARNOLD
Thanks. (Deep breath) Well, here goes everything. (He exits, we hear a knock on the door, then the door opens and closes. Ed and David jump up and rush to hallway.)
DAVID
You hear anything?
ED
Shhhhhhh.
DAVID
Ah, he stalled too long. They're gonna need time to warm up again. Let's eat.
ED
I can't hear a thing. This is ridiculous; a grown man listening at a hallway. I should go right up to the door. (He exits.)
DAVID
You want a sandwich?
ED
Could you not yell like that?
DAVID
Hear anything?
ED
No.
DAVID
Told ya. Have a sandwich. We'll know when they get goin'.
ED
You're taking this very calmly. I'm more curious than you, it seems.
DAVID
Looks that way, don't it.
ED
What'd you tell her, anyway?
DAVID
A little of this, a little of that. What's the difference? You know how it is with grown-ups
DAVID
Care to repose and repast?
ED
Come on, Kissinger. I'll teach you how to play chess.
DAVID
Wait, my sandwich.
ED
You'll concentrate better on an empty stomach.
ARNOLD
Is this it? We gonna sit and stare into space?
MA
You want I should do a Bubble Dance?
ARNOLD
I need a cigarette. (He gets one.)
MA
Frankly, Arnold, you've done a lot of crazy things, but this? . . .
ARNOLD
Adopting David is not a crazy thing. It's a wonderful thing that I'm very proud of.
MA
If you're so proud how come you were too ashamed to tell your mother? Everything else you tell me. You shove your sex life down my throat like aspirin, every hour on the hour. But six months he's been here and not a word. Why?
ARNOLD
I don't know.
MA
So what's new?
ARNOLD
Ma . . . y'know, you're not the easiest person in the world to talk to.
MA
What did I say? Do I tell you how to run your life? Let me tell you something, my son
ARNOLD
That's not true.
MA
No?
ARNOLD
No!
MA
Why then?
ARNOLD
... I don't know.
MA
You would if you'd listened.
ARNOLD
This isn't something I decided to do overnight. We put in our application more than two years ago.
MA
Who "we"?
ARNOLD
Alan and I.
MA
The two of you were going to do this together?
ARNOLD
That was the idea.
MA
Now I've heard everything.
ARNOLD
That's what I love about you; you're so open-minded.
MA
All right. So, Alan's not here. Why's the kid?
ARNOLD
Because with everything else I forgot about the application. Then, one day, the phone rang. It was the foster parent program and they had David for us. I told them what happened to Alan and they said I could probably take David anyway.
MA
And you said, "Send him on over."
ARNOLD
Not at first. But then I thought it all through, called them back, and said yes ... on a trial basis.
MA
I'm glad you got a money-back guarantee, but you still haven't told me why you wanted him.
ARNOLD
Because I was tired of widowing.
MA
Wida-whating?
ARNOLD
Widowing. Widow-ing. It's a word of Murray's.
MA
And a nice one at that. What does it mean?
ARNOLD
You know.
MA
No, I don't know.
ARNOLD
Widowing . . . feeling sorry for myself, cursing every time I passed a couple walking hand in hand, watching Tear-
MA
How should I know about Whatchamacallit? Did you ever say a word to me?
ARNOLD
I didn't think I had to. Christ, it's only been three years since Daddy died.
MA
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you trying to compare my marriage with you and Alan? (Haughty and incensed) Your father and I were married for thirty-five years, had two children and a wonderful life together. You have the nerve to compare yourself to that?
ARNOLD
That's not what I mean, I'm talking about the loss.
MA
What loss did you have? You fooled around with some boy . . . ? Where do you come to compare that to a marriage of thirty-five years?
ARNOLD
You think it doesn't?
MA
Come on, Arnold. You think you're talking to one of your pals?
ARNOLD
Ma, I lost someone that I loved very much . . .
MA
So you felt bad. Maybe you cried a little. But what would you know about what I went through? Thirty-five years I lived with that man. He got sick, I brought him to the hospital, and you know what they gave me back? I gave them a man . . . they gave me a paper bag with his watch, wallet, and wedding ring. How could you possibly know what that felt like. It took me two months until I could sleep in our bed alone, a year to learn to say "I" instead of "we." And you're going to tell me you were "widowing." How dare you!
ARNOLD
You're right, Ma. How dare 1.1 couldn't possibly know how it feels to pack someone's clothes in plastic bags and watch the garbage-pickers carry them away. Or what it feels like to
MA
May God strike me dead! Whatever I did to my mother to deserve a child speaking to me this way. The disrespect! I only pray that one day you have a son and that he'll talk to you like this. The way you talk to me.
ARNOLD
Listen, Ma, you had it easy. You have thirty-five years to remember, I have five. You had your children and friends to comfort you, I had me! My friends didn't want to hear about it. They said, "What're you gripin' about? At least you had a lover." 'Cause everybody knows that queers don't feel nothin'. How dare I say I loved him? You had it easy, Ma. You lost your husband in a nice clean hospital, I lost mine out there. They killed him there on the street. Twenty-three years old, laying dead on the street. Killed by a bunch of kids with baseball bats. (Ma has fled the room. Arnold continues to rant.) Children. Children taught by people like you. 'Cause everybody knows that queers don't matter! Queers don't love! And those that do deserve what they get! (He stops, catches his breath, sits down.) Whatever happened to good ole American Momism and apple pie?
DAVID
Could you keep it down? There's people tryin' to concentrate.
ARNOLD
Sorry.
DAVID
Round one over?
ARNOLD
I really lost control. I didn't mean to say any of that. But it came pouring out; I felt like I was fighting for my life.
DAVID
This is highly flattering
ARNOLD
Don't overdramatize. I do enough of that for both of us.
DAVID
I think you're wonderful.
ARNOLD
Where's Uncle Ed?
ED
Present. Is round one over?
ARNOLD
We've called a cease-fire to regroup.
DAVID
Can we eat now?
ARNOLD
Why don't you two go out for something?
ED
How about you?
ARNOLD
Don't know why, but I ain't hungry. Go on.
ED
You're not going back in there, are you?
ARNOLD
I can't leave things like this.
ED
You're very brave.
ARNOLD
I'm very stupid. None of this would've happened if I'd been honest all along.
ED
Or dishonest all along.
ARNOLD
That's not for me. Get going.
ED
Let me stay. We can all talk together.
DAVID
You want us to bring something back for you?
ARNOLD
No, thanks. (To Ed) No, thanks.
DAVID
Put a candle in the window when it's clear to come home. We'll wait on the bench.
ARNOLD
I'll do that.
ED
What'll it be; pizza?
DAVID
You paying?
ED
Sure.
DAVID
Then I know this intimate little French restaurant. . . (Exit)
ARNOLD
Round two. (Sits on couch, feet up) Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Bloom! It's safe to come out. David and Ed went for a walk and we've got the whole place to fight in.
MA
Enjoy yourself. I'm going to bed.
ARNOLD
Ma, I'm sorry I lost my temper.
MA
Ha! I'm glad you're sorry.
ARNOLD
Please come out here. We can't talk like this.
MA
You don't want to talk, you want to fight. But I don't fight with my children. In your life did you ever hear your father and I fight? No. And do you know why? I'll tell you why
ARNOLD
You wanna sit down?
MA
I'm sitting.
ARNOLD
All right. . . .
MA
And don't holler at me. People say things they don't mean when they holler and you've already said quite enough.
ARNOLD
I won't holler. You just hit a raw nerve. We won't discuss Alan. Only David.
MA
So discuss.
ARNOLD
Why don't you tell me what you already know, and we'll go on from there.
MA
I don't know anything.
ARNOLD
You spent the day with him. He must've said something.
MA
Let me think. He's an orphan . . .
ARNOLD
He's not an orphan.
MA
He said he was an orphan.
ARNOLD
Well, he's not. He was a battered child. They took him away from his parents. This is his third foster home. The first brought him back. The second he ran away from. So . . .
MA
So, he's a liar.
ARNOLD
He's not a liar . . .
MA
This isn't going to work.
ARNOLD
Come on, we're finally getting somewhere. . . .
MA
How do you expect me to sit here and discuss this insanity?
ARNOLD
You're right, this isn't going to work.
MA
Arnold, Arnold, what do you know from raising a child?
ARNOLD
What's to know? Whenever I have a problem I simply imagine how you would solve it, and do the opposite.
MA
Is this what you invited me up here for? To insult me and spit on your father's grave?
ARNOLD
For cryin' out. . . will you please sit down?
MA
Don't holler. I'm sitting. I don't know why, but I'm sitting.
ARNOLD
All right. Now we're going to talk about David. Not Alan, not Daddy, just David. And we're going to stay calm.
MA
Ha!
ARNOLD
I give up.
MA
Arnold, darling, open your eyes. Don't you see how ridiculous this is? I've been here less than a day, already I've seen you let him miss school, hang out on the street, go out without dinner . . .
ARNOLD
This is hardly a typical day.
MA
You wanna talk or make excuses?
ARNOLD
This isn't Little Lord Fauntleroy we're talking about here. If this kid decided I was coming down too hard on him, he'd pack and take off and I'd never get him back again. That sweet-looking little boy knows how to make more money in a night than you and I could make in a week.
MA
So you let him run wild?
ARNOLD
No. But I don't beat him up either. I teach him. I advise him, I try to set an example for him . . .
MA
Some example. Arnold, look, you live the life you want. I put my fist in my mouth, I don't say a word. This is what you want. But think about the boy. He likes you. He told me he loves you. He sees you living like this . . . don't you think it's going to affect him?
ARNOLD
Ma, David is gay.
MA
But he's only been here six months!
ARNOLD
He came that way.
MA
No one comes that way.
ARNOLD
What an opening.
MA
By you everything is a joke.
ARNOLD
Don't you understand
MA
That's it. (Stands) I'm finished. The world has gone completely mad and I'm heading South for the summer.
ARNOLD
You make it very difficult to have an intelligent conversation.
MA
You want an intelligent conversation? Do what I do
ARNOLD
You think this is easy for me? Look; my hands are
MA
Because you knew I'd show you how wrong you are.
ARNOLD
I'm not wrong.
MA
No? Tell me something
ARNOLD
Seventeen.
MA
Seventeen. Seventeen and you were doing God knows what together. Now, tell me; how old is this "son" of yours?
ARNOLD
I have no intention of sleeping with him if that's what you're driving at.
MA
I had no intention of having a homosexual for a son. So, look where intentions get you. Arnold, do what you want. You want to live like this? Gay gezzintah halt. I don't care anymore. You're not going to make me sick like you did your father.
ARNOLD
I made my father sick?
MA
No; he was thrilled to have a fairy for a son! You took a lifetime of dreams and threw them back in his face.
ARNOLD
What lifetime of dreams? He knew I was gay for fourteen years.
MA
What? You think you walk into a room, say, "Hi, Dad, I'm queer," and that's that? You think that's what we brought you into the world for? Believe me, if I'd known I wouldn't have bothered. God should tear out my tongue, I should talk to my child this way. Arnold, you're my son, you're a good person, a sensitive person with a heart, kennohorrah, like your father and I try to love you for that and forget this. But you won't let me. You've got to throw me on the ground and rub my face in it. You haven't spoken a sentence since I got here without the word "Gay" in it.
ARNOLD
Because that's what I am.
MA
If that were all you could leave it in there {Points to bedroom) where it belongs; in private. No, you're obsessed by it. You're not happy unless everyone is talking about it. I don't know why you don't just wear a big sign and get it over with.
ARNOLD
I don't know what to say to you. I really don't. I'm not trying to throw it in your face but it is what I am and it's not just a matter of who I sleep with. (Crosses to her) Ma, try to imagine the world the other way around. Imagine that every movie, book, magazine, TV show, newspaper, commercial, billboard, told you that you should be homosexual. But you know you're not and you know that for you this is right. . .
MA
Arnold, stop already. You're talking crazy.
ARNOLD
You want to know what's crazy? That after all these years I'm still here justifying my life. That's what's crazy.
MA
You call this a life? This is a sickness! But this is what you've chosen for yourself.
ARNOLD
Ma, look
MA
You have not heard a word I've said.
ARNOLD
I know you'd rather I was straight but I am not! Would you also rather I had lied to you? My friends all think I'm crazy for telling you. They'd never dream of telling their parents. Instead they cut their parents out of their lives. And the parents wonder, "Why are my children so distant?" Is this what you'd rather?
MA
But it doesn't have to be our every conversation either.
ARNOLD
You want a part in my life? I am not going to edit out the things you don't like!
MA
Can we end this conversation?
ARNOLD
No. There's one more thing you've got to understand. You made fun of my crocheting before. You think it's a cute little effeminate thing I do. Let me tell you something; I have taught myself to sew, cook, fix plumbing, do taxes, build furniture. ... I can even pat myself on the back when necessary. All so I don't have to ask anyone for anything. There is nothing I need from anyone except love and respect. And anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life. (Breath) You are my mother, and I love you. I do. But if you can't respect me . . . then you've got no business being here.
MA
You're throwing me out?
ARNOLD
What I'm trying to . . .
MA
You're throwing me out! Isn't that nice? Listen, Mister, you get one mother in this world. Only one. Wait. Just you wait.
DAVID
How's your hot dog, Big Spender?
ED
Been years since I bought one of these off the street. I just remembered why.
DAVID
Teach you to forget your wallet. (David sits on bench.)
ED
C'mon, lazy. I gotta walk this thing off.
DAVID
We're supposed to wait here. (Pointing up) Look. You can see our windows from here. Almost didn't take the apartment because of it.
ED
You lost me.
DAVID
Arnold never brung you here? This is where it happened.
ED
I didn't know.
DAVID
Yeah, here. They were walking back toward the street, Alan and the other guy, when the kids jumped out from behind these bushes. You can see; no way to run. Must've happened too quick anyway. Alan died right off, but the other guy crawled out to the street.
ED
I know.
DAVID
You can see a stain on the sidewalk in the daytime.
ED
Arnold showed you this?
DAVID
The day I moved in. At first I figured he was tryin' to scare me outta goin' into the park at night. I mean, I didn't
ED
No candle in the window yet.
DAVID
Give 'em time, they got a lotta yellin' to catch up on.
ED
That's one thing I can do without hearing any more of today. I saw Laurel this afternoon.
DAVID
Oh, yeah? What'd she want?
ED
Oh, nothing.
DAVID
Sure.
ED
Really.
DAVID
You don't have to tell me.
ED
It was nothing. Really.
DAVID
Hey, it's cool. You don't have to tell me. It ain't like we're old friends or nothing. After all, what am I to you?
ED
It was nothing. She just wanted to know if I was thinking of coming back.
DAVID
And you told her no.
ED
How do you know?
DAVID
I know.
ED
Frankly, I haven't made up my mind yet.
DAVID
You won't go back.
ED
Can we change the subject?
DAVID
Sure. So, now that you and Laurel are washed up, you gonna start shoppin' around?
ED
Well, since I haven't yet decided, then I haven't yet decided.
DAVID
Don't think about it too long or you'll wind up like Arnold.
ED
And that's bad?
DAVID
Arnold goes out to work and shop. That's all and that ain't healthy.
ED
You say that like you mean it.
DAVID
Who knows more about sex and its effect on mental health than me? Got any idea how many couches I've been laid out on? (Ed smirks.) Psychiatrically speaking. Starting when they turned my folks in I've had Freudian Analysis, Primal Analysis, Gestalt Analysis, Handwriting Analysis, Scream Therapy, Dream Therapy, Aversion Therapy and est. When they finally ran outta cures to put me through, they stamped my file "Hopelessly Homo," shook my hand, wished me luck, and shipped me off to Arnold. So I picked up plenty of know-how on my journey down the "Leatherette Road."
ED
Knowing and doing are two different things. You're only fifteen.
DAVID
Guess you don't read The New York Times. Seems no matter how many petitions they sign, they just can't get God to raise the age of puberty to eighteen. Kids have sex. But that's another subject.
ED
It certainly is.
DAVID
Bottom line is, here's Arnold
ED
So?
DAVID
So it's time for a change. Don't you think?
ED
Maybe.
DAVID
Got any suggestions?
ED
None I'd care to discuss with a fifteen-year-old.
DAVID
And you called him a bigot? Look, I ain't askin' for no miracles. (Though I must say I'd be proud to call you Daddy.) I'm simply suggestin' you could both use a little T.E.N.
ED
T.E.N.?
DAVID
Tension-Easing Nookie. Sex is very therapeutic.
ED
So you've said.
DAVID
What do you say?
ARNOLD
Hello, Mother. Hello, Father. The frankfurters are in bloom again. (Examines them) Such a strange flower. Suitable for any occasion. I wore one on my wedding day, and now I place them here in memory of something that has ... I don't know when to stop, do I? I brought supplies.
ED
We had the same idea. They're poison.
DAVID
And so unfilling.
ARNOLD
Found your wallet on the table. Thought you might be hungry.
DAVID
Round two over?
ARNOLD
Two, three, four, five . . .
DAVID
Who won?
ARNOLD
When I left we both knew who won. Now only Robert Browning does. Ed, would you mind if I spoke to Champ alone?
ED
Oh, sure.
DAVID
No, stay. I want witnesses.
ED
It's okay. Is it clear on the front?
ARNOLD
Should be. Got your key?
ED
Yeah. I'll see you both later, then.
ARNOLD
Thanks, Ed. (He exits.)
DAVID
That was lousy. He wanted to help.
ARNOLD
I don't need his help, thank you. (Pause) Things got pretty "padded cell" up there.
DAVID
Yeah? (Aloof)
ARNOLD
You had to sit here, didn't you? I'm sorry I didn't tell her about you before. But believe me, it's not 'cause I was ashamed.
DAVID
Glad to hear it.
ARNOLD
My mother has a certain picture of what I should be doing with my life, and it's very hard for her to adjust to all the curves I throw in.
DAVID
Forge on.
ARNOLD
All right. I knew that even if I told her about you, even before you came to live with me, that sooner or later we'd have this showdown. It has nothing to do with you. It's just her last go-for-broke campaign to straighten out my life.
DAVID
And?
ARNOLD
I asked her to leave.
DAVID
You're good at that.
ARNOLD
But you've got to understand that whatever happens between my mother and me has nothing to do with us.
DAVID
Come on, Arnold. This ain't Ed you're talking to. Whatever goes down with you two is exactly what will happen with us.
ARNOLD
How do you figure that?
DAVID
'Cause you're just like her.
ARNOLD
You wouldn't say that if you'd heard what went on up there.
DAVID
I know what goes on with mothers. Remember, you're my fourth. You think it's different 'cause we're both gay. But it's the same trip.
ARNOLD
No offense, Angel-Puss, but you're mistaken.
DAVID
Think so? What would you do if I met a girl, came home, and told you I was straight?
ARNOLD
If you were happy, I'd be happy.
DAVID
Bull-China! Here you are, workin' your butt off showin' me all the joys of gay life, givin' me the line of dignity and self-respect. . . . You tellin' me you wouldn't wonder where you went wrong?
ARNOLD
Not if you were sure that that's what you wanted.
DAVID
Yeah, I see the way you treat Ed. The guy keeps tellin' you he's Bi and all you keep doin' is callin' him a Closet Case.
ARNOLD
See, you don't know what you're talking about. I'd be perfectly willing to believe he's bi if just once he thought about the person he was with before he considered what sex that person was.
DAVID
How could anybody do that? You ever meet someone and not know what sex they were?
ARNOLD
That's not what I mean . . .
DAVID
I know what you mean and it's just as dumb. {Arnold tries to speak.) Shut up and let me finish. I stay with you because I want to. Dig? I really like living with you. I even like the way you try to mother me. But you can really be a shithead about things. But, you make me feel like I got a home. And a bunch of other assorted mushy stuff I don't want to get into here.
BUT
I'll walk if you try to use me as an excuse for sitting home alone, or to pick a fight with your mother or with Ed. Hey, you do what you gotta do. I ain't judgin'. Just don't blame anybody but yourself if you get my drift. (Pause) You get my drift? (Arnold nods.) I come down too heavy? (Shakes his head) Still want me to stay? (Arnold nods.) All right. Now we're dancin'.
ARNOLD
I ever tell you, I think you're swell?
DAVID
Break this up. I got school tomorrow.
ARNOLD
You go on ahead. I need an airing.
DAVID
Want company?
ARNOLD
Go on. I'll be up.
DAVID
Okay. See you later.
ARNOLD
David? You're not, are you?
DAVID
What?
ARNOLD
Straight?
DAVID
What would you do if I was?
ARNOLD
Kill you.
DAVID
Nice to know you care. (Starts to leave)
ARNOLD
Watch how you cross the street.
ED
Huh? What?
ARNOLD
It's me. Go to sleep.
ED
Arnold? Oh. (Trying to wake) What time is it?
ARNOLD
Almost six. Go to sleep.
ED
I waited up for you.
ARNOLD
I see.
ED
You want to talk?
ARNOLD
No. Go to sleep.
ED
I don't want to go to sleep.
ARNOLD
So don't go to sleep.
ED
You just get home?
ARNOLD
Awhile ago.
ED
I didn't hear you. Where'd you go? (No response) She said she's leaving.
ARNOLD
I know. I tripped over her bags on my way in.
ED
She didn't want to stay the night, but she couldn't get a flight out until morning. When I came in she was walking out to spend the night in the airport. I got her calmed down a little. (Pause) She'd stay if you asked her.
ARNOLD
Go to sleep.
ED
Stop telling me to go to sleep.
ARNOLD
All right, go to hell! (Sorry) Want a drink?
ED
Sure, white wine. (Arnold shoots a look.) Juice. (As Arnold makes the drinks) You know, I saw Laurel today. That's where I went. I don't think she's overjoyed with the separation. She told me she's pregnant. She's not, but she said she was to see if I'd go back to her ... if she was. God. The things that ran through my mind. Baby carriages, walks in the park, my folks playin' with it. . . Quite a sensation. I guess I would've gone back if she was. But then ... I don't know.
ARNOLD
I hope you didn't tell her that.
ED
Of course I did. After five years of marriage, I'm not going to start lying to her now.
ARNOLD
What'd she say?
ED
She said she could be ... if I came back. (Pause) She thinks we're sleeping together. Funny, huh? Laurel and your mother thinking the same thing. Maybe they know something we don't. (Clears his throat) I suppose it's her way of expressing anger. Laurel. Not your mother. Though I have seen happier women than her. Your mother, that is. (Arnold is now sitting on the bed. He snickers.) What's so funny?
ARNOLD
Seems like every time I turn around, here we are
ED
Talking.
ARNOLD
Talking. Me with a lump in my throat and you with a foot in your mouth.
ED
Why? What'd I say?
ARNOLD
Don't ask me. I stopped listening years ago.
ED
I don't see what I said that's . . .
ARNOLD
It was nothing. Pay me no mind; I'm drunk.
ED
Look, I know I'm not the most sensitive person in the world . . .
ARNOLD
Ed, take a note
ED
Are you really drunk?
ARNOLD
I hold it well, don't I? A trick I learned in finishing school. It's done with mirrors. You think I'm here in bed next to you but actually I'm asleep under a table in a bar on Forty-third.
ED
This is the first time I've ever seen you drunk.
ARNOLD
Well, get a good look, Leon, 'cause I'm dryin' out in the morning.
ED
Arnold Beckoff drunk.
ARNOLD
Blottoed, plastered, and plotzed . . . incorporated.
ED
Why'd you get drunk?
ARNOLD
Hello? Anybody home? Sometimes you really frighten me.
ED
Care to talk about it?
ARNOLD
Sure. Why should the neighbors have all the fun? (Lies back) I had a genuinely superior motive for drinking this much. Don't tell nobody, but I'm a pushover when I'm drunk. And I thought that if I got good and looped I'd repent and ask my mother to stay. It worked too. Until I got a peek at her sitting in there on the bed with her "Holier-Than-Thou" attitude and her "Merry Martyr" smile. The way she acts you'd think she and God went to school together. She thinks I hate her. I know the way her mind works and she thinks I hate her.
ED
I'm sure she knows you don't.
ARNOLD
Oh, no, she does. She thinks I hate her and everything she stands for. And I don't, for the life of me, know how to tell her that what I want more than anything is to have exactly the life she had. With a few minor alterations. My par-
ED
Are you really a pushover when you're drunk?
ARNOLD
Earth to Ed. Earth to Ed. Come in, please. (Edgiggles.) You've got your own problems don'tcha? C'mon, spill your guts.
ED
David said you haven't gone out since Alan died.
ARNOLD
We're talking about you now.
ED
I can understand you not wanting to at first, but still. You could at least go out for a few drinks, take a quick trip to the backroom. No harm in that.
ARNOLD
You may not understand this, but I want more out of life than meeting a pretty face and sitting down on it. That answer your question?
ED
Graphically.
ARNOLD
I do my best.
ED
If I made a pass at you now . . . Would you let me?
ARNOLD
All right, who spiked the orange juice?
ED
Actually, it's David's idea. He thinks you're pushing chastity too far. He says it's unhealthy.
ARNOLD
This is the first time I've been seduced in the guise of preventive medicine.
ED
I told him I'd consider it.
ARNOLD
What a friend.
ED
I didn't mean it that way.
ARNOLD
You never do.
ED
I mean, this is not exactly what Iwant.
ARNOLD
I came to the same conclusion myself. I think it was the wedding that gave you away.
ED
I didn't want that either. I mean, I did, but it turned out not to be what I want. In fact, it made me less sure than ever about what it is I do want.
ARNOLD
No problem. I've got a Sears catalog you can flip through. If you see it there give a primal scream and I'll get it for your birthday.
ED
You're not being fair.
ARNOLD
I'm upset, uptight, and up to my nipples in Southern Comfort. I'm sorry.
ED
Never mind.
ARNOLD
I said I'm sorry. You're trying to say something and I've got diarrhea of the mouth. Come on, I'll behave. I promise. (No response) Hey, this is Arnold here. You can tell me anything.
ED
I want another chance with you.
ARNOLD
Anything but that.
ED
Wait. Just think about it for a minute. It makes a lot of sense. We know each other so well, there'd be no surprises. We know what to expect from each other. You said yourself we have no secrets.
ARNOLD
What'd that kid of mine say to you?
ED
Just listen for a second. Laurel and I together ... it wasn't enough. Obviously or I wouldn't be here. And that's the point
ARNOLD
Talking!
ED
Talking. But here. Arnold, the time I've spent here with you and David . . . it's been the closest thing to whatever it is I want. I feel wonderful here. . . .
ARNOLD
"Don't care if the kid ain't mine, I wanna be the father of your baby." I saw that movie. I even read the book.
ED
Are you finished?
ARNOLD
Ed, please.
ED
Not five minutes ago it's what you said you wanted.
ARNOLD
I thought you weren't listening.
ED
I know you're upset about your mother.
ARNOLD
That's not it. . . .
ED
Okay, so maybe it's too soon after Alan . . .
ARNOLD
Oh, Puh-lease!
ED
I'm asking you to think about it. That's all. Just think.
ARNOLD
Don't you know that I have? How thick can you possibly be? Can't you see that since you called that's all I've thought about? Five days ago you walked through the door and from that moment I've been playing the dutiful wife and mother to your understanding if distant father. And David? He's been having the time of his life playing baby.
ED
And it's been wonderful.
ARNOLD
It's been preposterous. It's a joke. Three grown men playing house!
ED
You think this is playing house? You have no idea what playing house is. Arnold, I love Laurel. That may sound a little strange considering the circumstances, but my feelings for her are genuine and just as strong now as when we got
ARNOLD
That's a hell of a lot more than most people have.
ED
I'm almost forty, Arnold. Can you understand what that means? It means it's time for me to stop jerkin' around. I want more than a marriage which is at best purposeless, unfulfilling, but perfectly acceptable. Now, whatever you think of us, you could never describe us like that.
ARNOLD
Not the perfect part anyway.
ED
Are you through making cracks?
ARNOLD
I just don't see what you think is here that you can't have with Laurel.
ED
To tell you the truth I'm not sure either. But there's something that's kept me coming back. . . .
ARNOLD
Are you forgetting why we broke up in the first place? You really think you could bring your friends here? You ready to introduce me to your parents as your lover and David as our son? Ed. Angel, I just threw my mother—my mother —out of my house and all she wanted was to not talk about it. You think I'll ask less from you?
ED
I think it's time to find out.
ARNOLD
I don't know, Ed. Christ, I mean, I don't even know what this is supposed to be. I can't exactly buy a book or study some Reader's Digest article that's gonna tell me. All I know is whatever this is, it's not a Grade-B imitation of a heterosexual marriage. See, I thought that Alan and David and I could find out together ... so now . . .
ED
Let me help you find out. You, me, and David.
ARNOLD
I can't.
ED
Why? You scared I'll walk out again? Of course I can't guarantee anything . . .
ARNOLD
That's not it.
ED
Then is it David? You afraid I'll hurt him?
ARNOLD
I know how you feel about him, I know you wouldn't.
ED
Then what, Arnold?
ARNOLD
I am not Laurel.
ED
I'm counting on that.
ARNOLD
Go home, Ed.
ED
Are you crying?
ARNOLD
Leave me alone.
ED
I can't. Not with you like this. You need someone to talk to.
ARNOLD
I don't need anyone. Thank you.
ED
Well, maybe I do.
ARNOLD
Then go home. You've got a lovely wife who'd do anything for you. She can give you a home, a two-car garage, a child of your own, white picket fence . . . the whole shebang, double-dipped in chocolate and government-approved. Go home, Ed. I ain't got nothin' like that here.
ED
You really believe that? (Arnold nods.) Your mother did quite a job on you. (Teasing) Hello? Anybody home? You're gonna make me say it, aren't you? Undemonstrative soul that I am, you're gonna make me say it.
ARNOLD
I don't want you to say anything.
ED
Oh no, I'll say it. I'm not ashamed, embarrassed maybe, but not ashamed. But I'll be damned if I say it to your back. (Pulls Arnold over and pins him down)
ARNOLD
Ed! For Chrissake!
ED
You ready? Now, you better listen good 'cause I don't know when I'll get the guts to say it again.
ARNOLD
Ed, you're gonna wake my mother.
ED
So, let her hear. I hope they're both listening. Might as well let everyone know. Is everybody listening? Okay. Here goes. Arnold Beckoff... I love . . .
DAVID
What^hejiell's going on in here?
ED
Perfect timing.
DAVID
We can now see his black-and-blue eye.)
ARNOLD
You're not, you're not. What're you doing up at this hour?
DAVID
My alarm went off ten minutes ago. In case you lovebirds haven't noticed, it's morning.
ED
Jesus!
DAVID
Is this a closed marriage or can anybody join in?
ARNOLD
And baby makes three.
ED
My first pajama party.
DAVID
You look awful. Didn't you sleep?
ARNOLD
Nary a wink, blink, or nod.
ED
... incorporated.
ARNOLD
Thank you.
ED
Don't mention it.
ARNOLD
Any news from the other camp?
DAVID
I heard shuffling. I think she's ready to leave.
ARNOLD
I'd better splash my face and get ready for the grand exit.
ED
Need help?
ARNOLD
I think my battery's dead. Gimme a boost. (They shove from behind, Arnold flies to his feet. Then, a la Mae West) Thanks, boys. (Exits into bathroom)
DAVID
Well?
ED
I struck out. He said no.
DAVID
You asked first? Don't you know anything? It don't mean nothin', anyway. Arnold always says no when you ask him a question. Then he thinks about it and . . . Watch. (Calling out) Hey, Arnold? You want breakfast?
ARNOLD
No, thanks.
DAVID
Now . . .
ARNOLD
David? Maybe I'll have an egg.
DAVID
Most contrary person I've ever met.
ED
We better get dressed. They should be alone for the final round.
DAVID
I am dressed.
ED
Show-off. Well, start the coffee while I catch up. (Exits)
DAVID
Do you like pancakes?
ED
I love pancakes.
DAVID
Great. I'll make you some . . . when I learn to cook. (He turns on the radio.)
RADIO
Plaza 6-6654 with your requests. It's six fifty-four in the Big Apple on what looks to be a beautiful June day. And I'm here, with you, dedicated to the one you love. Now an oldie by request, from Beulah to Robert and Michael. Guess she just can't make up her mind. Ha-ha. All right, Beulah, here it is with love. (Music begins.) Our number's Plaza 6-6654 and I'm waiting to play one for you. (Music continues into the scene.)
ARNOLD
What're you listening to?
DAVID
One of those call-in shows, I think. Want me to change it?
ARNOLD
No, leave it. I ever tell you about the time Alan phoned in a request to one of those shows? They read the dedication wrong. He announced, "From Ellen to Arnold." He musta thought it was a typo or somethin'.
DAVID
What song was it?
ARNOLD
"My Funny Valentine." (David retches.) It was very romantic.
DAVID
Is your mother staying for breakfast?
ARNOLD
Ask her, not me. Has she shown her face yet?
DAVID
Nope.
ARNOLD
Go on in and see if she needs any help.
DAVID
"Into the jaws of death, into the mouth of hell!" Any message?
ARNOLD
No. (David exits. Arnold folds the couch. Ma screams offstage.) Not again.
MA
Arnold, did you see this eye? How could you let him walk around with a face like this? (Drags him to the kitchen) Come over here. I'm going to put some ice on it.
DAVID
Mrs. Beckoff, it's all right.
MA
All right? You look like an ad for "I'd rather fight than switch."
ARNOLD
Ma, leave him alone. Ice won't help. He's had it for two days.
MA
What're you talking? I saw him yesterday . . .
ARNOLD
He covered it with makeup so he'd look nice for you.
DAVID
I'm okay. Really. But thanks, anyway.
ED
C'mon, Champ. I'll buy you breakfast out.
DAVID
Great. But I gotta do somethin' first. (Toward bedroom) I'll be out in a minute.
ED
I guess I'll see you later. (To Ma) It was a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Beckoff.
MA
The pleasure was mine, Ed. I hope you and your wife come to your senses. Couples must learn to live with conflict. After all, a problem is never as permanent as a solution.
ED
Uh . . . thank you. (Shouting) David? Hurry up.
ARNOLD
Aren't you going to wash up first?
ED
That's all right. I'm all right. (Pause. Desperate.) David!!!
DAVID
I'm comin', already!
ARNOLD
Ed? What we were talking about before? Y'know, six years is a long time ... I don't know. But we can talk.
ED
That's all I'm asking. (Trying to control himself) Good. Good.
DAVID
Here I is.
MA
You take care of that eye.
DAVID
I will. It was nice meeting you. (To Ed) Remember your wallet this time? (Ed checks.) See you later, Arnold. (Gives him a peck on the cheek)
ARNOLD
Have a nice day. And don't come home before school's over!
DAVID
You look like someone kicked you in the head. (They exit. David sticks his head back in.) And you two play like nice children. (Out)
ED
Yahoo!
ARNOLD
He likes the wallpaper. Covers a multitude of sins.
MA
I'll be leaving myself, now.
ARNOLD
You don't have to fly back to Florida. You could stay . . .
MA
With your brother? No. It's better if he doesn't know about this. I'll call him from Miami, tell him I changed my plans and couldn't make it up this week.
ARNOLD
I'm going to tell him what happened.
MA
Do what you want. I don't care.
ARNOLD
Ma, it's important that he knows. He's part of this family too.
MA
What else do you want to do to me? What, Arnold, what? You want me to leave? I'm leaving. You want me to fight? I'm too tired. You want me to change? I'm too old and I can't. I can't, I can't, I can't. So you do what you have to do, and I'll do what I have to do and I hope you're satisfied. (Arnold groans.) If I had ever opened a mouth to my mother like you did to me, you'd be talking to a woman with a size six Wedgie sticking out of her forehead. But I didn't raise my children like that. I wanted them to respect me because they wanted to. Not because I beat it in to them. Go know.
ARNOLD
Do we have to start this again?
MA
Yes. Because you can't put all the blame on me. It's not fair. Some of it was my fault, but not all. You think I didn't know about you, Arnold? Believe me, I knew. And not because you told me. I didn't need you to tell me. I knew but I said no. I hoped . . . What's the difference, I knew and I turned my back. But I wasn't the only one. There are other things you should have told me. You opened a mouth to me about your friend Alan. . . . How was I supposed to know?
ARNOLD
Why? You would have understood?
MA
Maybe. Maybe not. You can't know for sure. But I flew up for the funeral and you never said a word.
ARNOLD
So you could've done what? Tell me he's better off dead?
MA
Or maybe I could've comforted you. Told you what to expect. You and your "widowing." (She turns to leave, stops, takes a breath. One last try.) And about this Ed
ARNOLD
I don't know. I think so.
MA
Like you loved Alan?
ARNOLD
No. They're very different. Alan loved all my faults
MA
You've got an unusual way of looking at things, Arnold Beckoff.
ARNOLD
Runs in the family. Ma, I miss him so much.
MA
Give yourself time, Arnold. It gets better. But, Arnold, it won't ever go away. You can work longer hours, adopt a son, fight with me . . . whatever, it'll still be there. But that's all right. It becomes part of you, like wearing a ring or a pair of glasses. You get used to it and it's good . . . because it makes sure you don't forget. You don't want to forget him, do you? (Arnold shakes his head.) So, it's good. (Pause) I guess that's what I would have said . . . (The phone rings) if I'd known. You'd better answer that. It may be something with that. . . son of yours.
ARNOLD
Hello. . . . Hi, Murray. . . . What? . . . The radio? It's on. . . . All right, hang on. (He puts the phone down and goes to the radio, turning up the volume.) It's Murray, something about the radio.
RADIO
. . . no, I've just checked with my producer, who took the call, and he's confirmed it. What a morning. Whatever is this world coming to? So, here it is, a dedication from David to Arnold with all his love . . .
ARNOLD
How do you like that? That's some kid I got there, huh? (Turning) You hear that, Ma? (Sees she's gone) Ma? (Goes to door) Ma?
