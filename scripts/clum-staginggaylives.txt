Hi.

[Enjoying his own highly exaggerated cowboy parody] Howdy.

You waiting for someone?
JAMEY
Not anybody in particular.
STRANGER
Well, then, maybe we could go over to my place for a drink or something. I mean, that is, if you're free for awhile....

And a great big good morning to everyone in the Bay Area, This is Jerry Grady—

JERRY
saying it's 7
HERB
and this is KDJ-FM—
JERRY
on this, the first official day of spring, March the 20th—
HERB
and it's 1973—for those of you who just got in from Pomona,
JERRY
and a glorious spring day it is. Herb, can you believe this weather?
HERB
The kind of day that makes you want to introduce your wife to your girlfriend ...
JERRY
[Driveling banter] Not likely...
HERB
Just kidding, Honeybun .. .
JERRY
Fine for Honeybun, but what about your wife?. ..
HEATHER
Thanks again.
MR
What was that about?
MRS
They just want to put up some posters. It seems Mr. Milk from down the block is running for some kind of office.
MR
Milk—the guy that bought old man Dawson's camera store? The hippie?
MRS
Yes.
MR
Hard to imagine people voting for a hippie for much of any-thing—except maybe a haircut. But, then, what do I know anymore?
MRS
I know—I gave up on trying to second-guess the world years ago.
MR
Everything's changing so fast. Even here, even old Castro Street. It's not the neighborhood we used to know, lovey.
MRS
No, but I guess it's just life, Jim—new people, new ideas, new blood.
MR
I suppose. I keep trying, but I don't know—I'm just not ready to become part of "the Pepsi generation." Be honest now, Katie.... Sometimes ... don't you sometimes miss the old days?
MRS
Maybe ... some ... sometimes ...
MR

BOTH

MR
[Enters] Morning, Jim, Mrs. Murphy.
MR
Good morning.
MR
First of the month—just thought I'd stop by and save you a stamp.
MRS
Certainly. I've already made out your check.
MR
Of course you have. That's what I like—good, solid people. Sometimes I think we're the last of a dying breed.
MRS
Pardon?
MR
You see what's going on—the riffraff moving in, trying to take things over. First it was the hippies, then this kind and that kind, till now only the good Lord knows what's going to be moving in next door. If it's not Abdul and his tribe of screaming banshees, it's Bruce and Christopher and their potted plants.
MR
Yeah, well—me, I've always believed in taking people one at a time, whoever they are. They treat me right, I treat them right—that simple.
MR
[Cynically] Right.
MRS
And besides, let's face it—the clock keeps ticking, the world keeps turning, and there isn't one thing we can do about it.
MR
Yeah, and that's the crime of it.
MRS

MR

ENSEMBLE

MRS
I'll get your check.
HEATHER
Come on, Dee!
DEE
Never shout at a diva, darling—especially this early in the morning.
JOHN
But we've got work to do—light to bring to the wilderness—and it's the early bird that gets the worm.
DEE
Not in my neighborhood.
HEATHER
Hey, you guys, let's get with it.
JOHN
Yeah! Like Harvey says—
HEATHER

DEE

HEATHER
HEY! What do you think you're doing?
MR
What does it look like?
JOHN
Wait. That's Harvey—he's local—lives right here in the neighborhood.
MR
I know who he is—or all I need to know. I won't have these walls cluttered up with homosexual literature,
HEATHER
Hey, man, last time I heard, this was a free country.
MR
The country may be, but this building is private property—my property.
DEE
But the Murphys said it was alright.
MR
The Murphys don't own the building. I do. And I say it's not alright. Got it?HEATHERER
HEATHER
You asshole.DEE
DEE
DOWN, GIrl.
MR
What did you just call me?
HEATHER
You heard me.
COP
What's the problem?
MR
This person has defaced my building, and then when I called her on
HEATHER
WHAT? Defaced your building!? A poster. A poster.
HARVEY
Could I be of some assistance?
COP
Who'reyou?
HARVEY
The gentleman in question—in a manner of speaking.
COP
Who?
HARVEY
[Extends hand] Harvey Milk ... running for city supervisor. Remember
COP
Never mind that. Some of your people seem to be causing trouble.
HARVEY
But didn't I understand them to say that they asked you about putting
MRS
They did ask me, Dan.
MR
But it's my building.
HEATHER
[Exasperated] Look, dude, 1 think we've all gotten that part.
HARVEY
So of course they assumed it was within Mr. Murphy's power to grant
MR
Save your speeches for the Kremlin. But if you're the one responsible,
HARVEY
Excuse me, sir, but there are ladies present.
MR
[Becoming flustered] What? I didn't—she was the one—Dan, that
HARVEY
Oh, you mean Heather? You, a grown, rather hearty-looking gentleman,
MR
Young lady! Look at her! And she called me an asshole.
HARVEY
May I ask you something? Are you married?
MR
Well, of course. But what does that have to do with anything?
HARVEY
I just assume that if you're married, we seem to be taking up a lot of this officer's time over something that I'm sure you've heard a woman call you at least once in your life.
MR
My wife would never use language like that.
HARVEY
Then you must be a very, very lucky man.
HEATHER
APOLOGY!
HARVEY
Look. You know he's an asshole, I know he's an asshole, and I'm sure his own sweet mother knows he's an asshole. But we have a campaign to run. We don't have time for these little skirmishes. Now please—Heather, Heather, Sweet Heather in Leather—please just take it back, and let's get on with it.
HEATHER
But I didn't do anything.
HARVEY
Since when does that matter? A small concession for the greater good? Please? For Harvey.
HEATHER
Jesus, shit! Okay, Harvey. I'll do it. But you remember this.
HARVEY
I promise you. [He escorts her back. Motions to DEE.] What are you doing? There's a crowd here. The fliers, the fliers.
HEATHER
What I said—I take it back.
MR
My hearing must be going. I didn't quite catch that.
HEATHER
I SAID I TAKE IT BACK! you mother—
HARVEY
[Jumping in] Right! Well. Good. Great! And now, shake hands—[He joins their hands.] Everybody! Let's all shake hands. Harvey. Harvey Milk.
COP
Okay, I think we can break this up now. Let's move it. And you, you get your people out of here.
HEATHER
But what about the posters?
HARVEY
Here, you guys get Heather out of here. Get some breakfast. On me. Here. [He comes up with a few cents.]
DEE
Never mind. I'll buy—as usual.
HARVEY
Once again, Dee, thanks.
JAMEY
That little of dyke's quite a pistol.
HARVEY
Who, Heather? She's not a dyke.
JAMEY
Oh, excuse me. Les-s-s-bian.
HARVEY
As it happens, she's neither a dyke nor a lesbian.
JIAMEY
That guy said something about "homosexual literature."
HARVEY
I'm the homosexual—she just dresses funny.
JAMEY
Uh—Buck.
HARVEY
Buck? Buck?
JAMEY
[Gives in] Jamey.
HARVEY
Tell you the truth, I'm a lot more comfortable with the name Jamey than with the name Buck. Buck makes me want to start making up limericks. Let's see—Buck, Buck—what rhymes with Buck? So, where're you from, Jamey?
JAMEY
Texas—Tyler, Texas.
HARVEY
Toby Tyler Texas. I think I drove through Tyler once. East Texas, isn't it?
JAMEY
Right.
HARVEY
That's pretty heavy-duty cowboy drag to be from east Texas.
JAMEY
It keeps the tourists happy.
HARVEY
[Understands the euphemism] Oh. So what's a nice boy like you ...?
JAMEY
You ain't really asking, are you?
HARVEY
Not if you don't want me to.
JAMEY
I'd just as soon you didn't, right?
ZHARVEY
Okay. Fine.
JAMEY
So what are you going to do if people get wind that you're, you KNOW—
HARVEY
GAY?
JAMEY
YEAH.
HARVEY
They'll know. That's the point—or part oF IT.
JAMEY
Whaddya MEAN?
HARVEY
I'm running out in the open—as a gay candiDATE.
JAMEY
You gotta be kiddin'. You wouldn't stand a Chinaman's chANCE.
HARVEY
I'll take that up with my Asian friends. But I look at it this way—I've got
JAMEY
[Laughs] Yeah, well, I don't know about out here, but back in Texas, ever body might root for the underdog, but only 'til he loses. Then they take the poor sonofabitch out and shoot HIM.
HARVEY
Thank God Texas isn't the wORLD.
JAMEY
Don't let them hear you say that.
HARVEY
I was just about to make a pot of coffee. How about it?
JAMEY
Well, I was on my way over to the park, but... yeah, why not?
HARVEY
And while you're here, maybe you can help me with the mailing that we have to get out this afternoon.
JAMEY
Wait—never mind the coffee.
HARVEY
Why?
JAMEY
If you're trying to suck me into this Don Quixote thing you're running, I'll just pass.
HARVEY
Don Quixote? A hustler who makes literary allusions?
JAMEY
[Goes icy] Okay, so you met a hustler who's familiar with Don Quixote— something to tell your grandchildren. I gotta go.
HARVEY
I didn't mean anything.. . . Look, I'm sorry I struck a nerve, okay?
JAMEY
[Starting to exit] Don't lose any sleep over it. See ya.
HARVEY
Hey .. . Buck?
JAMEY
What?
HARVEY
Zo vat da hell? Little cuppa coffee's gonna kill ya? Halv a shtale dough-nudt, maybe?
JAMEY
[Smiles, glances in the direction of the park] Maybe next time. Adios.
HARVEY
Yeah. Adios. [He watches as JAMEY exits; then he turns to exit and passes MRS. MURPHY in doorway.] Top of the morning.

We've got to get you to a doctor.
JAMEY
No.
HARVEY
You're being stupid.
JAMEY
[He grabs HARVEY, holds him.] Don't leave me.
HARVEY
Hey, I know you. You're that kid from Texas....
JAMEY
Jamey. Just stay here a little while—please?
HARVEY
I don't know if I can do anything, but let me take a look. [HARVEY tears sleeve of shirt down.] Christamighty. Somebody cut you. Who did this?
JAMEY
I don't know. Somebody grabbed me from behind, then I was down on the ground, and there was this knife and—OWÜ!
HARVEY
Sorry. Oh ... [Becoming slightly nauseated, light-headed] I don't think it's as bad as it looks. It's a long slash, but barely under the surface .. . oh .. . [He bends over to keep from fainting.] I worked as an orderly in the service, but I never did have the stomach for it—I can't stand the sight of blood.
JAMEY
You're not going to pass out on me, are you?
HARVEY
I wouldn't make book on it.
JAMEY
Thanks for doing this,
HARVEY
Harvey.
JAMEY
Oh, yeah—it scared the hell out of me, Harvey.
HARVEY
Well, you should be scared. Jesus Christ! There are people out here who don't like us. What they do like is to kick the crap out of us—and just for the hell of it—queer-bashers, maniacs, and, God knows, the cops themselves—or maybe you just haven't heard.
JAMEY
You don't have to get so riled up. I'm okay.
HARVEY
And you could be dead—would be dead except for a little stupid luck.
JAMEY
For the pain.
HARVEY
Oh yeah, great. This stuff thins the blood. Do you want to bleed to death?
JAMEY
And do you want to tell me why you're acting like you're my father?
HARVEY
Well, somebody should, goddammit!
JAMEY
So why the fuck should you care?
HARVEY
I really don't know! [Cools off, moves to help JAMEY up] Come on, let's get you out of here.
JAMEY
Never mind! I can take care of myself. [He tries to get up, collapses in agony, verging on tears.] AHHHHJ
HARVEY
Yeah, you're doing one great fucking job of it. Come on. [Helps him up]
JAMEY
[Almost a little boy] Harvey . . . maybe . . . maybe you could take me home?
HARVEY
That was the plan. Where do you live?
JAMEY
Over in the Mission District. But I meant, maybe you could take me home—with you—to your home ... just for tonight?
HARVEY
[Mock coy] Well, I don't know. Whatever will the neighbors think? Okay—just for tonight. I'm just down the street. You can take the bed. I'll make up the sofa.
JAMEY
Such a gentleman.

Always. Or at least just for tonight.

HARVEY
Good morning, Kmart shoppers ...
HEATHER
[As ALL exit] Harve? You coming?
HARVEY
Be there in a minute. This young lady can't find the sink stoppers.
HARVEY
It was wild—but you've got to reach the people somehow. Still, they must have wondered what in the hell this crazy bunch of people were doing.
JAMEY
I'll bet. [More serious] Harve ... what were you doing?
HARVEY
What do you mean?
JAMEY
What's all this about? You've already said you don't expect to win.
HARVEY
Not tomorrow, no—but who knows, someday maybe ... So for now I'm doing it for today. And I guess I'm doing it for the wolf.
JAMEY
Wolf?
HARVEY
[Embarrassed smile]j That's what I call it—something that happened a long time ago, back in New York. I was around about your age, I guess, and I'd "encountered" this lovely man who says he wants to see me again and I should meet him the next day—three o'clock, Bronx Zoo, the penguin cages. So next day here I am, running around madly looking and looking for the penguin cages, absolutely sure he's waiting and wondering where the hell I was. But—no penguin cages. Finally I stop and ask this zookeeper, and he says the Bronx Zoo doesn't have any penguins.
JAMEY
Oh.
HARVEY
Right. And of course, the truth finally hits me—he's never had any intetion of meeting me—and I'm a total idiot. So now I'm totally humiliated— I'm fighting back tears and trying to find my way out of the goddamned Bronx Zoo when something catches my attention. There's this wolf, stalking back and forth, back and forth in its cage—you know how zoo animals do until they become . .. resigned, I guess. Then, all of a sudden, it stops dead still and looks at me—directly into my eyes—and this like cold shiver runs througH ME.
JAMEY
Why?
HARVEY
I didn't get it then either. But what I finally figured out, years later, was that back there in the Bronx Zoo, I had been looking directly into my own Soul.
JAMEY
What?
HARVEY
Desperation. The feeling that no matter how successful 1 was or how many friends were there, and no matter how loving the beautiful young man sleeping next to me, the wolf would be there, too, down inside my skin, remiding me that none of it and nothing would ever be enough to make up for the aloneness, this like, desperate longing.
JAMEY
Yeah, loneliness I understand. But longing for what?
HARVEY
Not loneliness—at twenty it's loneliness; at forty it's aloneness. A loging for ... completion maybe. Something you never got early on. You know, sometimes I'd like to get a whole fleet of those great big yellow school buses and drive up into the front yard of every kid in the world who's ever been called "Sissy" or "Tomboy" and say, "Hey, come on, kid, you're going with me. And we're all gonna go to some place we can all be together, where none of us will ever again have to explain anything to anybody."
JAMEY
Somewhere over the rainbow.
HARVEY
Sure. Why not?
JAMEY
You really are out to save the world.
HARVEY
Just alter it a little. After I got out here, I decided. I'm tired of being the wandering Jew. I'm tired of trying to change me when, dammit, it's the world that needs changing. And when I decided that, something happened—the wolf and I began a sort of truce with each other. [Dramatically] So now out here on this western crust of the continent, all the way across the country from New York, we decided to make our stand.
JAMEY
You know, Harvey, I like you—but I think you just might be crazy as hell.
HARVEY
And wouldn't be the first to say so.
JAMEY
You've really had a bunch of different lovers?
HARVEY
Well, let's just say a few more than several.
JAMEY
Maybe you just didn't meet the right one.
HARVEY
The odds are pretty heavy against that particular theory.
JAMEY
It's nice here.
HARVEY
What? This is nice?
JAMEY
A kitchen. I've just got that rented room over in the Mission District. I haven't sat and talked at a kitchen table since I left Texas.
HARVEY
Haven't you met anybody since you've been here?
JAMEY
I've met people, yeah—lots of people. But nobody seems to be particularly interested in conversation.
HARVEY
Well, I am. So talk—sing me the ballad of Toby Tyler Texas.
JAMEY
Don't call me that.
HARVEY
You certainly get your quills out when the conversation gets around to you. I don't usually get into self-revelation so early on either, but for whatever reason, these last few days I've been spilling my guts out to you. So it's like I used to say to Johnny Whittenauer back in the pup tent, I showed you mine; now show me yours.
JAMEY
I'd just as soon not talk about me.
HARVEY
So far I know you're a fairly bright kid who wants to hide behind some silly cowboy drag and prove something to someone by being real bad and selling himself to any schmuck with a ten dollar bill.
JAMEY
Twenty.
HARVEY
Oh, twenty—that puts you right up there with Madame Pompadour. So what's the story, Jamey?... "Buck?"
JAMEY
Have you ever had someone you were really close to turn into a stranger on you like that?
HARVEY
Yeah, I'm afraid I have.
JAMEY
[Struggling] But I mean someone you knew would always, always ...
HARVEY
People can disappoint you.
JAMEY
No—you don't understand. [Starts to open up] See, Daddy and me—my dad and I were best—closest... It was always him and me, you know—no matter what I was in—ball games, little award things, school stuff, you know. He was always there, right in the front row, cheering for me. See, we were like ... heroes ... to each other... .
HARVEY
And...?
JAMEY
[Shuts down] And then we weren't.
HARVEY
When he found out...
JAMEY
When I told him. When I was dumb enough to think maybe there wasn't anything I couldn't tell him.
PREACHER
You have broken his heart, Jamey.
HARVEY
It's a hard thing to do.
JAMEY
Tell me about it. It was the middle of the summer, but you'd have thought I was freezing to death the way 1 was shivering—my teeth were chattering so hard I could hardly get the words out. But finally everything—the words, the feelings, all of it—just started coming....
PREACHER
And the father ran rejoicing to meet his son, his prodigal son, so long gone away, having turned his back on that which was good and right and blessed. And the father asked, "Are you clean now?" And the son replied, "Yes, now I am clean and whole."
HARVEY
How did he take it?
JAMEY
He just sat there and started filling his pipe—in total silence, taking out a pinch of tobacco and tamping it down, then another and another ...
PREACHER
You have broken his heart, Jamey. You must be clean. You must be washed in the blood. You must choose, Jamey—just as your father must choose—between the righteous and the unholy.
JAMEY
Then he lit it and took a few puffs and turned to look out the window for a few minutes that seemed like forever....
PREACHER
You have broken his heart, Jamey. You must choose—the way of the unspeakable or the arms of love in the father.
JAMEY
Finally he just stood up and walked out of the room.
PREACHER
He has come to me, Jamey, and together we have gone to the Lord. He cannot be asked to embrace the unholy. And so you must leave. You no longer have a home.
JAMEY
And he's never spoken another word to me.
HARVEY
Jesus Christ.
JAMEY
I doubt it. You know, somehow I always would've thought it would've been me that he'd've believed in. So much for heroes, huh?
PREACHER
You have broken his heart, Jamey.
JAMEY
Harvey, why have you been so good to me?
HARVEY
I'm trying to get my first aid badge, and I need somebody to practice on. Why do you think? I like you.
JAMEY
Thanks.
HARVEY
You're welcome. Now shut the fuck up and get back to bed—I've gotta get back to work.
HEATHER
[Offstage] Harvey, we're out of copy paper.
HARVEY
I'm coming. I'm coming.
JAMEY
Harve, I'm gonna leave today.
HARVEY
Today? So what's the hurry? You're still hurt. Tomorrow maybe—you can leave tomorrow.
JAMEY
You've put up with me for three days already. I feel bad about putting you out of your bed and all. Besides, I'm a lot better.
HARVEY
So if you're a lot better, you can sleep on the goddam lumpy sofa.
JAMEY
If I'm a lot better, I can go back to my place.
HARVEY
[Angry without knowing why] Fine. Suit yourself—whatever. So I'll be seeing you around, huh?
JAMEY
Right.
HARVEY
Right. Just for tonight.
JAMEY
Right.
HARVEY
Right.
HARVEY
Good morning. My name is Harvey Milk, and this Tuesday I'll be in the race for city supervisor. Your vote's important, so make it count. Good morning ... (etc.)
JAMEY
Morning. Tuesday primary— Harvey Milk—city supervisor— 'preciate it. Tuesday primary— Harvey Milk—city supervisor— 'preciate it. Morning. Tuesday primary—Harvey Milk—city supervisor—'preciate it. Remember—Milk ... Harvey Milk ... as in "milk and cookies."...

HARVEY
Talk to Heather when you get in. She's going to need you on the plans for Monday.
JAMEY
Morning. Tuesday primary—Harvey Milk—city supervisor—'preciate it.
MAN
Never heard of him.
JAMEY
This is Harvey—a friend of working people.
MAN
Right. Like I say—never heard of him.
JAMEY
You will, though. You will. When taxes have gone out of sight—or you need something and nobody at City Hall will even talk to you ...
HARVEY
Lighten up, peewee.
JAMEY
It's easier talking to this wall than to some of these people.
HARVEY
Might be more interesting, too.
JAMEY
I guess I'd ... like to be.
HARVEY
But you're not. Busting your butt, working as hard as me or harder ... and yet you still can't believe things will change—that we're going to make it happen.
JAMEY
What I believe in, Harvey, is you. I believe that you believe it, and that's enough for me. It comes to the same thing.
HARVEY
No, baby, it's not even close.
JAMEY
[Nonplussed] Well ... see you tonight.
HARVEY
Can't live with'em, can't live without 'em, huh, Officer?
HARVEY
My name's Harvey Milk, and I'd appreciate your support in the race for city supervisor.... [WORKER ignores him, exits. Then, to himself...] Harvey Milk—candidate in the race for ... Harvey Milk ... over-the-hill hippie who thinks he's gonna change the world ... [Smiles at himself] Harvey—you old fool...

HARVEY
[Answering each] Not exactly shopping—borrowing. Begging actually. Preparing. For the campaign.
ALL
What? What do you mean? Campaign? (Etc.)
HARVEY
The campaign. The real, overall campaign. And we're right on target. Hell, we did even better than we thought we would—tenth place out of thirty-two candidates our first time out of the gate ain't exactly chopped liver. So it's time to pump it up—give them a little light, a little music, a little theater. And [flourish] ... a change of costume .. . [Pulls a rumpled suit out of a shopping bag.] How's that for a schmatte? Isn't it awful? Oh, and a change of image. [Dramatically removes his hat, reveals a conservative haircut. Others react in shock.] Dear lady. Good gentlemen. It's time....

Me and the boys have been keeping an eye on you, and I just wanted to come down here and shake your hand.
COP
Why?
MR
[Holds up a newspaper] You seen this? People are starting to take this Milk guy seriously—skipping along behind the pansy, right down the primrose path.
COP
What's that got to do with me?
MR
Well, see the way we figure it, you get this crazy trying to get elected over there in District 5; then we need to get somebody else over here from District 8 to sort of balance things out—one of our own—somebody that knows how to be a team player. And I think you're our boy.
COP
Me? I'm no politician.
MR
Exactly. What you are is what we need—a good man, an honest man, a down-to-earth, real man.
COP
Well, yeah ...
MR
A man who's already proven himself. Who was it that was over there in Vietnam defending his country's honor against the threat of foreign domination?
COP
Well—me.
MR
And who is it who's out here on the streets every day protecting his country's integrity from the blight of internal corruption?
COP
Me.

Damn right, you. You know what you believe in—that's all you need to know. You do know what you believe in, right?

the Gay Press
JAMEY
I've seen it.
HARVEY
Oh.
JAMEY
You'd expect to get slammed by the establishment papers, but from other gay people—[Reading from the paper] "The aging, sold-out-to-the-establishment Milk, long known to have a certain taste for—in quotation marks— 'rescuing' young boys, is now cohabitating with a young 'friend'—the guy likes quotation marks—a young friend with a reported history of alcoholism and prostitution. With the sterling examples you have set in your own life, Mr. Milk, how can we not entrust our future to you?" Nice. The world out there doesn't have to bother keeping us down. All it has to do is sit back and watch us rip each other to shreds. Harvey ... do you want me to move out?
HARVEY
What?!
JAMEY
I mean, if I'm an embarrassment to you ... maybe it would look better for you, for the campaign.
HARVEY
What look better for me? Creeps like that make things look any way they want them to look. We live our life. We're working for what is—not the way things look. You can't let this stuff get to you. This is just one more radical rag newspaper and one more radical idiot with a pencil and an ax to grind. So this month they say I devour children; next month they'll have me walking on water. C'mere.

No.
HARVEY
Why?
JAMEY
Because.
HARVEY
Because?
JAMEY
Because we're broke.
HARVEY
Too broke for a lousy stick of butter?
JAMEY
[Gets up abruptly] Yeah, Harve, that broke. Too broke for a lousy stick of butter—too broke for half a lousy stick of butter. What little we take in from the camera store and my fares goes for fliers and posters and campaign photos and whatever else— [Becoming frantic] This afternoon I went through our dirty laundry to see if maybe there was a quarter down in the corner of one of our pockets that I'd missed when I checked the first time and—nothing. We're way over our credit with the Murphys, and I'm not going to go back in there and ask for another thing. I know they'd let us stretch our credit, but I just won't do it.
HARVEY
Worcestershire.
JAMEY
What?
HARVEY
I'll try the Worcestershire sauce—at least it's wet. [Shakes a few drops onto potatoes] Sit down, baby.
JAMEY
Why do I feel so guilty about this?
HARVEY
[Eating slowly] Middle-class morality—poverty as the original sin.
HARVEY
You know, when I worked on Wall Street, I'd go out to dinner and barely touch the food—sometimes leave half a steak on the plate and not even ask for a doggie bag. I guess it would just get thrown out.
JAMEY
Would you pass the sour cream, please?
HARVEY
[Reaches to do so automatically, then realizes the joke] Oh yeah, and I'll have some when you're finished—and some of those chives—

JAMEY
I've made all kinds of plans, things to do, places to show you and all. Harvey wanted to come down here with me, but he's so busy since he got elected, I hardly get to see him myself. I thought we could stop by the park on the way in so you can meet him.
PATRICIA
At the park?

PATRICIA
[Shudders] How can you all stand it? How can he stand it?
HEATHER
You just go on, honeybunch. Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
JAMEY
That Anita Bryant-Miami thing isn't helping things any.
DEE
No-talent old sow.
JOHN
Why does everybody say that? Would this nasty little hate campaign of hers be more justified somehow if she did have talent?
DEE
No, but if she did, maybe she'd've kept her tired old ass in show business and wouldn't have to find some other way to grab the spotlight.
HEATHER
Now this local yokel Briggs is trying to jump on her bandwagon.
PATRICIA
Briggs—the Proposition 6 guy? What is it? Why should people want to fire someone for their private lives? I mean, I had this fifth grade teacher—you remember Miss Nettie, Jamey—she lived with her friend for years, and nobody thought anything about it. At least I never thought about it till recently. And I suppose it was like that for Miss Nettie and her friend. She lived her life privately and was one of the best teachers I ever had. So why do people want to make such a big issue out of it?
JAMEY
Because people are afraid of things they don't understand.
HEATHER
And a fear campaign will buy you a hell of a lot more news coverage than a photo of you and your cocker spaniel. Hey, look alive, dudes—Harve should be here soon. We have to be at the TV station in less than an hour.
JAMEY
Where's the hate-crime report? I told him I'd stay here and look it over.

Bottom drawer.

MODERATOR
Thanks for being with us tonight.
H
Thank you.
HARVEY
[Quipping] It's the Milk-White show.
MODERATOR
A lot of people might find it surprising that two supervisors from such diametrically opposed backgrounds seem to be aligned on the major issues that have come before the board thus far.
HARVEY
"Politics makes for strange bedfellows"?
WHITE
[Uncomfortable at "bedfellows"] Both Supervisor Milk and 1 believe in working for the good of all the citizens of San Francisco.
HARVEY
And as for background, both Supervisor White and I come from mid-die-class, working people. That makes for a rather strong commonality.
MODERATOR
But wouldn't Supervisor Milk's being the first openly gay elected official indicate some major difference in political viewpoint?
HARVEY
The rights of gay people are just one of the many issues on which the people of this city elected me.
WHITE
And you know, if you think about it, there are nine of us on the Board of City Supervisors. Nine—just the same number that's on a baseball team. So it's just like in baseball, the nine of us have to all learn to put aside our differences and pitch in and work together for the sake of the team.
MODERATOR
Many see what's going on in Dade County, Florida, as the first volley, the Fort Sumter if you will, of a major political backlash in this country. And now Senator Briggs's recent proposal—the banning of homosexuals from teaching in public schools. Do you see a backlash happening here?
HARVEY
History tells us that the original Spanish fort on which the city of San Francisco was eventually founded was one of the first experiments in the commune, or communal living system between the Spanish settlers and the Native Americans already in the area. Even our very history is that of people working within their differences for the common good.
WHITE
Teamwork.
HARVEY
What today might sound like the war cries of the Anita Bryants and John Briggses of this world are really just the dying gasps of institutionalized bigotry and injustice. The time of superstitious suspicion, ignorance, and hatred is dead and gone.
WHITE
Besides, it doesn't really matter what you might think about the guy next to you. When you're down in the locker room, when you're out there on that field, everybody's got to be pulling in the same direction.
MODERATOR
So neither of you sees Anita Bryant, John Briggs, and their issues as being a divisive element in the political landscape of the city?

Resignation Announcement
JERRY
In a surprising announcement this afternoon, Dan White has resigned as a member of the city's Board of Supervisors. Though there have been rumors of a rift with certain other supervisors concerning Proposition 6, White denies that his resignation has anything to do with the defeat of Senator Briggs's bill, which would have banned homosexuals from the public school system. He has cited personal problems as the reason for what an unnamed supervisor is reported to have called White's quote "public hissy fit" end of quote. And end of the news.... Now ... back to music with Herb "the herb" Gardener!

And this is not necessarily for Dan White, you understand. A little bit of Detroit Station with "If You Can't Take the Heat, Stay Out of the Kitchen" ...

Calling Home
JAMEY
I love this city.
PATRICIA
Is it always like this? I've heard that San Francisco's like early autumn all year round.
JAMEY
Pretty much—a few warm and cool snaps, but, yeah, pretty much like this year round.
PATRICIA
If I should stay here after school, I think I'd miss the different seasons.
JAMEY
Like back in Texas? Freezing cold winters and summers so stifling hot you can't breathe. As far as I'm concerned, they can keep it—all of it.
PATRICIA
You don't ever miss home?
JAMEY
This is home. Harvey's my home.
PATRICIA
I like Harvey.
JAMEY
Me, too.
PATRICIA
I noticed. It's a different world out here.
JAMEY
That it is.
PATRICIA
Sometimes I wish ... I don't know, I see Mama and Daddy in their tiny little shoebox of a life, and I think maybe if they somehow or other had been able to see more—be more out there—maybe they wouldn't feel so afraid of the world, of life. If they could just open up a little, maybe they could climb over that wall they've built around themselves.
JAMEY
They won't.
PATRICIA
Maybe. But I don't want to give up on them.
JAMEY
Why?
PATRICIA
Let's call them.
JAMEY
Let's us call them?
PATRICIA
Yeah—now. Let's try.
JAMEY
I have.
PATRICIA
Well, with both of us working on it, we'll just wear them down. Now come on, a dime. Oh, never mind, I have to have one here someplace.
JAMEY
Oh, here.
PATRICIA
Yeah, Jamey, but—for better or worse—it's Mama and Daddy, too. And me. And you. There, then.
JAMEY
Why?
PATRICIA
Because this hurts you so much . . . because even though they're wrong—terribly wrong—you still love them.
BOTH

PATRICIA
[Quietly] Come on.
HARVEY
Dan, will you stop this?.., Oh, sorry, Carl.. .. Yes, of course you can let him in. Right. [He hangs up. Phone almost immediately rings again.] Yes? ... Now look, I'm not going through anymore of this, Dan.... Well, like I said, you should have thought of that before.... No, I'm not about to intercede. As far as I'm concerned, it's between you and the mayor. If he wants to let you take back your resignation, then fine. ... I'm sorry, we must have a bad connection. It sounded for all the world like you just called me a smug little faggot. I've always wondered when you'd finally get around to saying that.
JAMEY
Thanks for telling the guard to let me in. It's like trying to get into a prison around here.
HARVEY
Sure.
JAMEY
"Sure." You'd think the idiot would have recognized me, as many times as I've been up here.
HARVEY
I guess he just wanted to make sure it was okay.
JAMEY
Why wouldn't it be okay?
HARVEY
Because you smell like a brewery.
JAMEY
So I had a coupla beers. So?
HARVEY
So I'd venture to guess it was more than a couple, and you don't handle even a couple very well.
JAMEY
; I know of a couple I can handle real well.
HARVEY
Come on, Jamey.
JAMEY
We did. We had dinner and then we—and then after she left, I stopped by The Corral for a bit—the place was packed—got on my nerves.
HARVEY
Sorry.
JAMEY
"Sorry."
HARVEY
Look, Jamey, what do you want? I don't like talking to you when you're like this.
JAMEY
When are you going to come home?
HARVEY
I'm not sure. There's a bushel of stuff here I need to take care of.
JAMEY
So what else is new?
HARVEY
Certainly not this conversation.
JAMEY
Come on, Harve—I never see you anymore. We work our asses off forever to get you elected, and then you get elected and I think, "Great, now he's elected—now maybe we can have a little time together," but now you're working harder than before, except now maybe it's worse because at least then I was right beside you the whole time and—[he starts crying] and I know I'm acting like a spoiled brat—but I miss you. I just... miss ... you.
HARVEY
[Goes to JAMEY] What is this all about?
JAMEY
Is the wolf back, Harve? Are you going to leave me?
HARVEY
What? What are you so upset about?
JAMEY
Nothing.... I called home tonight—well, Patricia placed the call, really, but then she gave me the phone. Mama talked to me and everything—like maybe things were better—but then nothing would do but her trying to get Daddy to come to the phone in spite of me begging her not to. But I shouldn't have worried about it. He wouldn't talk to me. He still won't have anything to do with me, Harve. And when he wouldn't come to the phone, Mama and him started arguing and she started crying and told me I should be patient and give him time. [Almost hysterical bark of laughter] Hah! "Give him time." After five and a half years I should be patient! Give him time! Why do I give a good goddamn, goddammit?
HARVEY
I goddamn don't goddamn know, goddammit. Here, boy, you know what we're going to do? Right now, you and I are going to go home and get in bed together, and we're going to hold one another and pretend that we're the only two people that have ever, ever existed.

I walk down the street, people—good people—say, "Hi, Dan. How's it going, Dan?"
MR

WHITE
I know I quit—but I didn't mean to. And now Moscone won't let me take it back. And Milk thinks it's funny—he's happy about it. Leave the government to his kind. I deserve a second chance. I paid my dues—I came up the hard way, the right way.
MR
You're right, Dan.
WHITE
Harvey Milk doesn't even own a car. He doesn't make house payments.
MR
You're right. You are right. We both know what this is all about. The pestilence, the scum come clawing, chewing away the very fabric of freedom. They want to silence us—put a foot on our backs and crack our spines, to crush the voice of right and reason. Dan ... Dan ... listen....

Mmm-hmmm. That old stone-faced dude in the corner of the jury box— same clothes every day, brown suit, yellow tie? When they were playing the tape of Dan White's confession, Old Picklepuss had tears in his eyes.
HEATHER
[Becoming more agitated] The "Twinkie Defense," for Christsake! The guy walks into City Hall, murders two people in cold blood—his lawyer tells the jury, oh, it's okay, he was just a little upset, just a little sugar high, too much junk food, could happen to anyone, right? And I swear to God, those bastards were lapping up every stupid word of it.
DEE
People believe what they want to believe. And you can believe that if our straight, white mayor was the only one lying dead right now, they'd have Dan White plucked and ready for frying. I guess you get extra points for shooting a faggot.

No. John's right. We're going to have to organize some kind of damage control—keep things from getting out of hand. People are going to be crazy. Things could turn ugly fast.
JAMEY
Good! Let them feel our violence for once.
DEE
Come on, Jamey.
JOHN
Wait, think. That's not what Harvey was about.
JAMEY
Harvey's dead! Or am I the only one here who remembers that?
HEATHER
[Offended, slightly angry] We all do, Jamey.
JOHN
We didn't get justice here. But vengeance is not a substitute.
JAMEY
Why don't you put that in a fortune cookie?
DEE
We better get moving. There's not much time to get something together.
HEATHER
Jamey?
PATRICIA
They're right. We have to do something.
JAMEY
No.
PATRICIA
But we should—
JAMEY
No! Go home, Patricia—back to school, back to Tyler, whatever. You can go home—you know?
PATRICIA
Please don't do this.
JAMEY
I'm sorry. I love you. I do. And I know you've done your best to understand. But right now all I have is this rage ... such rage.... I thought it began the day Harvey died, but I was wrong. I think it's been there my whole life. The world has always drawn a line between us—those of us like me and those of you like you. And we've never been allowed to cross that line—not really. Now you can't cross over either. Not unless you know what it feels like to be despised for this—the things here—to be despised for your very heart. And you will never know what that feels like, thank God. And, yes, I do love you. But for now, little sister, you don't have a part here. Go home. Please.
HARVEY
Hello, Toby Tyler Texas.
JAMEY
Hey, Harve.
HARVEY
I thought you quit with that crap.
JAMEY
[Bitterly] Just celebrating, Harve. Dan White gets out tomorrow—after four and a half years—time off for good behavior, no doubt. A toast—Truth, Justice, and the American Way. [He takes a big slug.]
HARVEY
Wait for the fat lady, babe. It isn't over yet. In a few months Dan White's going to go out and buy a brand new pistol, put the barrel into his mouth, and pull the trigger. People who hate have to destroy. And if their hatred has no place to go, they end up destroying themselves.
JAMEY
Right... and look at the hell created in the meantime.
HARVEY
Yeah. Look at it.
JAMEY
What?
HARVEY
You, that's what. Does anything about us, our work, our life together— does any of it mean anything to you?
JAMEY
Why do you think I'm still so goddamned ... MAD?!
HARVEY
Good! Be mad. Mad is energy and energy is the power to say, "This is not going to do." Then you have to learn to let it go. Let it go, Jamey. You have your job—do it.
JAMEY
I am. We are. We're working. But the wolves, Harve—they just keep acomin'.
HARVEY
[Parody] So—you just keep agoin'.
HARYEY
When you're young, you believe in stars,
JAMEY
Then you find that stars can suddenly tumble;
HARVEY
So in time you abandon stars—
JAMEY
Then you find you're overwhelmed by the night;
HARVEY
And fear conquers trust Like a cancer, Hopes turn to dust—
JAMEY
Idols will rust, given time enough to—
HARVEY
Somehow you must Find some answer— Something to offer, some recompense,
JAMEY
Something to make it all make some sense....
HARVEY
But... now you know not to trust the stars,
JAMEY
Looking up, you'll lose your footing and stumble-
HARVEY
Look inside—learn to use the scars— Look to each defeat to teach you to fight.... Use the tearss that you've shed— Or they'll blind you—
JAMEY
Blood that's been shed—
HARVEY

TOGETHER

HUTTON
Steve. Steven. Listen to me. You're not making sense, [Pause] What? Steven, I am listening; I'm just not hearing you. Move away from the juke box. [Pause] I've told you I can't. My position is ... difficult. Go home and sleep on it. Things'll be better in the morning. They always are. Believe me, Steven. No, don't do that! Steven! Steve! [STEVE has hung up. Slowly HUTTON replaces his receiver. He continues to talk as if to himself, and throughout the play his solo speeches become more and more to an imaginary audience as he gets drunk.] Believe me. My position is difficult. So what about your position? What are you going to do, Steven? What are you going to do now?
MAN
Got anywhere to go? Oi. Got anywhere to go? [Pause] We could go to my place. It's not far. I've got a car. How about it? I've got videos. [Pause] No. There's always the woods. Shall we go up to the woods? It's pretty safe. I've got poppers. Do you like poppers? You'll love them. [STEVE resolutely reads his book.] What do you like? Eh? Bet you like to suck. Or I'll suck you? Go on! You know you want to. [MAN strokes his groin again.] I'll pay you. Fiver for a blow job. [Pause] Ten?
STEVE
Look, I just want to read my book. Sorry.
MAN
[Strokes his groin again.] I've got nine inches. [Pause. He gets up angrily.] Little shit! Don't give me that "innocent little boy" crap. I've seen you hanging round here before. You know what's going on in there. Don't you? Prick-teaser. [Starts to go into toilet. Stops.] Join me inside if you want. If your book gets too boring. Little shit! [Exit to toilet. STEVEN checks to see if the MAN has gone. Gets up and starts to leave. GLEN enters. As they pass each other, they look back simultaneously and stop. Then GLEN continues into the toilet. STEVE stands still and then hurriedly returns to the bench and starts reading again. Eventually GLEN reemerges and sits on the bench. They don't acknowledge each other.]
GLEN
[After a pause] Enjoying it?
STEVE
Sorry?
GLEN
The book.
STEVE
Oh yeah. Hamlet. By William Shakespeare.
GLEN
Exams? Bet you'll be glad when they're over.
STEVE
In a way. I quite enjoy it actually. Shakespeare, I mean.
GLEN
He speaks very highly of you too. [STEVE laughs. They stare at each other briefly. GLEN breaks the moment.] Cigarette?
STEVE
No. Sorry. I don't. Sorry.
GLEN
Nothing to be sorry for! Wish I could stop. Don't you ever start.
STEVE
Sorry.
GLEN
Stop saying sorry.
STEVE
Sorry. I'm ... nervous.
GLEN
[Feigning indifference] Do you go to the theatre then?
STEVE
Not really. Can't afford it. They think it's ... poofy. Anyway, there's not much round here.
GLEN
Right! Not exactly a contender for European City of Culture. Basingstoke. God, I miss London.
STEVE
Wow! You moved here from London. Why would anyone move HERE from London? Bloody hell! I can't wait till I'm old enough to get out of this dump.
GLEN
And how old are you?
STEVE
Look, I was just leaving.
GLEN
Don't let me stop you. [GLEN continues to smoke, looking out front. STEVE looks at him awhile, then opens his legs wide. GLEN ignores this. STEVE begins to caress his own groin. GLEN sees this and suddenly gets up to leave.]
STEVE
Sorry, I didn't mean ... I thought ... oh shit! Sorry.
GLEN
Stop saying sorry. It's just ... well, I'm nervous, too. [They stare at each other a few seconds.]
STEVE
You're ... lovely.
GLEN
You're not so bad yourself. [He sits.]
STEVE
Most of the other guys who come here are old.
GLEN
That's not a crime.
STEVE
Or ugly.
GLEN
I guess that is.
STEVE
You're the best-looking bloke I've ever seen here.
GLEN
Do you come here often? [They laugh at the cliché.]
STEVE
Quite often. Well, often!
GLEN
At your age!
STEVE
Why do you keep going on about my age? [Suddenly panicked] Fuck! You're not a—oh shit!
GLEN
Don't panic. I'm not a policeman. Played a few in my time, though.
STEVE
Wow! You're an actor. I want to be an actor. Wow! Are you famous? Should I know you?
GLEN
Not if you don't go to the theatre much.
STEVE
But I'm sure I've seen you.
GLEN
Well, you may have seen me persuading the nation that the greatest hardship in life is having to take two bottles into the shower. Or that the very, very best a man can get is a razor blade.
STEVE
Wow! Was that you? I thought you said you weren't famous!
GLEN
[Laughs] God! You're so cute! [They stare again.]
STEVE
Can we go to your place?
GLEN
Sorry, I live with someone.
STEVE
Oh. Might have known you'd have a boyfriend.
GLEN
What about the woods?
STEVE
Too dangerous.
GLEN
Pity.
STEVE
I live five minutes away.
GLEN
You must be joking. What about your parents?
STEVE
They're out. In London. They won't be back till late. My nan's very sick. About to snuff it.
GLEN
Great! I mean that they're out, not that your nan's ... Shall we go then?
STEVE
[As they get up] Yeah!
GLEN
How old did you say you were?
STEVE
I didn't. Sixteen. You?
GLEN
Not sixteen.
LINDA
Tart!
STEVE
Jealous! Oh, Linda. He's lovely. And he goes like a train!
LINDA
Tart!
STEVE
And he's got eyes like Tom Cruise. He's so witty and gorgeous and—
LINDA
Dangerous!
STEVE
Don't start that again. He's one of the nicest people I've ever met.
LINDA
Because he fucked you?
STEVE
No, because he was sensitive and funny and said he thinks I'm very mature. And he didn't fuck me. You know I'm always safe.
LINDA
Safe! What's safe about bringing a stranger into your home? And what's safe about picking people up in toilets? You promised me you wouldn't do it anymore.
STEVE
I don't. Well, I don't go in anymore. I just sit outside minding my own business.
LINDA
Steve!
STEVE
Can I help it if people want to talk to me?
LINDA
Talk to you!
STEVE
Yeah. Glen and I had a really interesting chat—about Shakespeare, actually. He's a famous actor, you see, and—
LINDA
Oh, Steve! Babe! This is Linda you're talking to. Don't bullshit me! If some strange bloke start talking to you outside a public bog, he's only interested in one thing, and it's not your opinion of Shakespeare's use of animal imagery in King Lear.
STEVE
He's not a strange bloke. His name's Glen, and it was Hamlet anyway!
LINDA
But why there? It's so ... yuk!
STEVE
Maybe it is. But where else? Listen. I know you think it's disgusting—
LINDA
I didn't say that.
STEVE
No. You said yuk. Okay. So you think it's yuk. Well, it could be yukkier. Do you know how many times I get offered money up there? I never take it. Because then I would feel yuk.
LINDA
Don't tell me you're looking for love!
STEVE
Oh, what's the point? You're not hearing me.
LINDA
Of course I'm—[STEVE has turned the music up very loud and is dancing again.] Steve. Steven Carter, I really hate you sometimes. [She gets up and turns music off.] Now you listen to me! Don't you dare hit me with all that "nobody understands" crap! When you told me you thought you were gay, I wasn't even surprised.
STEVE
Was it the Jason Donovan calendar I asked for at Christmas?
LINDA
It was the "Bananarama Boxed Set" which gave it away.
STEVE
Cow!
LINDA
Oh, babe! I just think you're too young.
STEVE
You're never too young to like Bananarama.
LINDA
It's only because I care. Give yourself a chance. It could be a phase.
STEVE
Well, if it is, it's a phase I've been going through since I was eleven.
LINDA
Eleven!
STEVE
That's how old I was when I discovered masturbation. Mind you, it was another three years before I realised I could do it on my own.
LINDA
Stop trying to shock me. I'm unshockable. Just slow down; you're confused.
STEVE
What on earth makes you think I'm confused? I've never been more certain of anything in my life. Listen, supposing I said to you, "Linda, you're confused; just wait a couple of years before you decide if you really like men or not." What would you say? You'd say, "But I know now!" Well, I know now, and I want to enjoy myself now while I'm young and attractive. Just like you do. Well, while you're young anyway. Besides, what else does a dump like Basingstoke have to offer me?
LINDA
But you're obsessed with sex! Even straight people of your age don't do it as often as you. It's a different bloke every time you call me! I've only done it once, and that was in the Costa Brava with a Spanish waiter who kept saying really romantic things like "Nice beeg Eeenglish girlee." I've never had a boyfriend.
STEVE
Ah! That's the point. You've never had one, but if you did, you could be open about it and show off about it. You could use that word. Boyfriend. I'd love to have a boyfriend. Then maybe I wouldn't need to ... Someone to go to the pictures with. Do ordinary teenage things with. Introduce my parents to. Someone like Glen.
LINDA
Oh, come on! He's old enough to be your father!
STEVE
He's twenty-four.
STEVE
Because as far as I can make out, everyone my own age is straight. I go to an all-boys school, and I feel as if I'm the only one. All my classmates are always going on about this bird and that, how they managed to get three fingers up Sally or Natasha or Sonia. It's so . .. yuk!
LINDA
Do you fancy any of them?
STEVE
God, no! They're all so immature. [Pause] Except...
LINDA
Who? Oh go on, Steve, tell me.
STEVE
You'll only take the piss.
LINDA
Who, me? Go on, except who?
STEVE
If you laugh, I'll never talk to you again. John. John Westhead.
LINDA
Wow! Why should I laugh? He's gorgeous.
STEVE
Gorgeous! Everytime I see his Head Boy badge, I wish it was an invitation.
LINDA
I sure wouldn't kick him out of bed for eating biscuits!
STEVE
Now who's obsessed with sex? He's different. Special. I love ... his eyes, his walk, the way he seems so popular while being aloof. He's special. I love him.
LINDA
Oh, babe! How sweet!
STEVE
There! I knew you'd take the piss. Why is it sweet? It hurts.
LINDA
Sure it's not just a crush?
STEVE
For three years?
LINDA
Well, he's a bit of a hero, isn't he? Beautiful, intelligent, good at sports—
STEVE
Okay, okay! There's no need to rub it in. Anyway, there's something else. You see, unlike every other bastard at that place, he doesn't ... well he doesn't...
LINDA
Bully you! He doesn't come to your rescue either.
STEVE
In my dreams he does.
LINDA
Yuk!
STEVE
Sometimes I wish he did bully me. At least then I'd exist for him. It's hopeless.
LINDA
Because he's straight.
LINDA
[Comes up behind him and puts her arms round him] You seeing him again?
LINDA
The toilet! Why there?
STEVE
So I can tell him if it's safe to come back here.
LINDA
Ring him.
STEVE
He couldn't give me his number.
LINDA
Please be careful. It's only because I care.
STEVE
Yuk!
LINDA
I just don't want you to get all bitter and twisted.
STEVE
[Turning to hug her] Please stop worrying. [Door slams downstairs.]
FATHER
[Offstage] Steven? We're back.
STEVE
Hi, Dad. Mum. Linda's here.
LINDA
[As DAD comes up stairs] They still think we're going out together?
STEVE
Convinced of it. Every time I say I'm going to see you, Dad gives me his "that's my boy" smile and winks.
LINDA
I'm not sure I approve.
STEVE
Why?
LINDA
You're not exactly my type.
STEVE
You're not exactly mine! [They collapse on the bed "fighting."]
FATHER
[Entering] Oh, sorry, Linda.
LINDA
It's okay, Mr. Carter. We were just... I was helping Steven with his homework.
FATHER
[Smiling] I can see that.
STEVE
How's Nan?
FATHER
Hanging on. She's seems a bit better. Well, she's old you know.
STEVE
That's not a crime.
FATHER
No. But it happens to all of us. She's had a good innings. She'd love to see you, Steve. We're going again on Thursday.
STEVE
Sorry, Dad. Geography on Friday. Last paper. Maybe at the weekend.
FATHER
I hope she hangs on that long. Don't worry, son. She'll understand. He's a good lad, Linda. Knows how important qualifications are. I've told him, if you really want something in this world, you've got to work for it. Doesn't matter how difficult things seem to be—never give up. Right, Steve.
STEVE
Right, Dad.
LINDA
Well, we know what homework you'll be doing on Thursday. Tart!
STEVE
I love it when you talk dirty! Thanks for listening, Lins. I don't know what I'd do without you.
LINDA
See! Girls have their uses.
STEVE
Mmmm! Nice beeg Eeeeenglish girleee. Be gentle with me! [They start to fight on the bed, and LINDA tickles STEVE.] No! Don't! Stop it! Don't!
STEVE
Please. I'll do anything. Just leave me alone!
HUTTON
Alone. I bet you think you're alone, don't you? You're not, Steven. There are thousands. Millions like you.
STEVE
Please!
HUTTON
I meant what I said, too. About it getting better. I think you understood what I was trying to say. You smiled. I helped. Of course I helped.
STEVE
Help me. Someone!
HUTTON
Didn't I? I wanted to spell it out.... I wanted you to know that it was the same for me at school. The name-calling.
BOY 
Queer bastard!
HUTTON
The beatings. The spitting. Somehow the spitting was worse than the violence. Made me feel... dirty. But the graffiti was the worst. It was so ... permanent. Official. Me and my crime immortalized on desktops. I used to wake up every weekday morning with a knot in my stomach. What new horrors—
STEVE
Don't!
HUTTON
—terrors did the schoolday hold? But I survived. To be proud of what I am. So why couldn't I tell you that? Because ... Ring again. Ring, Steven, and tell me you're alright. And I'll tell you you're alright. Ring me. Sod my job. Sod the law! [As the light fades on HUTTON and comes up on the rest of the space, the boys charge at STEVE with a primal, terrifying yell. This becomes a cry of "goal" as STEVE escapes the melee and sits at the side on the floor, reading. Two boys start kicking a ball around. Two others, KEVIN and DAVE, break downstage.]
KEV
Fancy diving off for a fag, Dave?
DAVE
No chance, Kev. Me and John have got to see old Pubic before assembly to sort the arrangements for the disco.
KEV
I still don't believe it's going to happen.
DAVE
It's going to happen!
KEV
But there's never been so much as a barn dance at this place before. Christ, if ever a school was aptly named—"English Martyrs."
DAVE
True. But there's never been a Head Boy like Johnny Westhead before either. You should have heard him charm Pubic.
KEV
What did he say?
DAVE
Well, he asked him why he was so against the idea of a dance, what he was worried about. Pubic got all red-faced and blustery the way he does and talked in veiled terms about feeling that young men from a single-sex school suddenly confronting the opposite gender in the sinister atmosphere of low lights and a primal beat may lead to undesirable consequences. He then muttered something about unexplored passions waiting to explode.
KEV
Bloody hell! Doesn't he know we've all been exploding for years?
DAVE
John just pointed out that the most wonderful thing about being at English Martyrs was that we had all learnt to behave like "gentlemen."
KEV
I would've pissed myself.
DAVE
I nearly did. Especially when Johnny said we wanted the disco so we could prove we could behave like gentlemen and if Pubic didn't trust us, wasn't he admitting the failure of his teaching philosophy? The old git just caved in under the weight of John's charm and logic!
KEV
[As JOHN enters] And here's the man himself. Johnny boy!
JOHN
Kev. Ready to see the old fart, Dave?
DAVE
Let's get it over with.
KEV
Here, he's not likely to change his mind, is he?
JOHN
No chance. Friday's the night! The tickets are printed now, and I've just delivered one hundred to Notre Dame.
KEV
Notre Dame Convent School for Girls. Christ, it gives me a stiffy just saying the words!
DAVE
Now there's some unexplored passion waiting to explode! Did you see Jenny Keeley?
JOHN
Yes, I saw Jenny Keeley.
KEV
Who's Jenny Keeley?
DAVE
Their Head Girl, dickhead. What a woman. Legs, tits, and brains! I had such a dream about her the other night.
JOHN
Did you?
DAVE
No. It was fun trying, though,
JOHN
Hands off! She's mine—or she will be after the disco. [The school bell. STEVE gets up, and as he walks across the playground, he is jostled by the two other boys.]
BOY 
How's your bum, Carter?
BOY 
Want to see my willy?
BOY 
Bringing a nice boy to the disco, are you? [They grab his bag and start throwing it between them. KEVIN joins in.]
STEVE
Please don't!
DAVE
Leave it, Kevin. We are supposed to look after the younger boys.
KEV
It's only a bit of fun. Anyway, whoever said Steven Carter was a boy? [KEVIN and DAVE exit.]
BOY 
[Spilling the contents of the bag on the floor and picking up an exercise book] What have we got here? "SC loves JW."
BOY 
"SC Loves JW," Steve Carter loves just wanking. [Laughter]
BOY 
[Hits STEVE in stomach] Wanker! [As STEVE doubles over, the boys attempt to take his trousers off, chanting, "Get 'em off; get 'em off."]
BOY 
Watch it. Hutton's coming! [Spits at STEVE, who is lying on the floor in a foetal position] Queer bastard! [All exit rapidly except JOHN, who starts to approach STEVE. STEVE kneels up, and they make eye contact. Exit fOHN.]
HUTTON
[Entering. He looks in the direction the boys have exited.] Bastards! You alright? [STEVE scrambles to his feet, holding his trousers up.] Now what's going on?
STEVE
My trousers for a start. [He pulls them up.]
HUTTON
Don't try to be smart.
STEVE
I thought that's why I was here.
HUTTON
Look, Steve. I only want to help. Who was it?
STEVE
It was ... just a bit of fun. Look, sir, I'll be late for assembly. I'm alright.
HUTTON
This happens to you a lot, doesn't it? I'm not blind.
STEVE
They don't mean it.... It's just a bit—
HUTTON
—of fun. Your idea of fun, is it?
STEVE
[Near to tears] I just wish they'd ... WANKERS! Sorry, sir.
HUTTON
Steven, if there's anything you want to talk about—
STEVE
Yeah! [Pause] My fly button's broken.
HUTTON
You don't have to put up with this, you know. No one should. Doesn't it upset you? Being picked on. Being called ...
STEVE
Called what?
HUTTON
I'm not deaf either. Things like, queer bastard—
STEVE
Yes, sir. Yes, it upsets me. Because you see, sir, I'm not a bastard.
MR
[Entering] Come along, Carter. You'll be late for assembly.
STEVE
Sorry, Mr. Ayres. [He staggers off still holding his trousers up.]
MR
[Calling after him] And is that any way for a gentleman to walk? Straighten up, lad. Straighten up!
HUTTON
Do you want to know about my first time, Steven? I was fourteen. On my way home from school one day I got caught short. There was a toilet behind the bus garage. As I stood at the urinal, somebody came out of a cubicle, started to leave, then changed his mind and went and washed his hands. I remember thinking how his parents must have brought him up properly. And then ... and then he came over and stood at the urinal and unzipped. I was just giving myself a little shake, ready to leave, when I noticed he wai' doing the same—only he was giving himself a big shake. And I looked closer and ... and I ran out of the door and up the stairs and into the light. And I ran half the way home. Out of breath, I stopped. And then ... and then I ran back. Even faster. He'd gone, of course, and I was ... disappointed. God knows why. I wasn't even sure what I'd gone back to do. But I was disappointed. And then a cubicle door opened ever so slightly. And I stared at it. And it opened a bit more. And I stared some more. And I saw someone inside. I don't know who was taking the bigger risk, me by staying there or him ... because he suddenly just opened the door wide and gestured with his .. . free hand ... for me to come in. [Pause] And I did. And he closed the door and put his jacket on the floor at the bottom of it. And in complete silence I "made love" for the first time in my life. To someone I've never seen since. Whose face I cannot remember. And it was exciting and incredibly, indescribably naughty, and ... and I felt I "belonged." Shocking, eh? I felt I belonged in a toilet. I'm sure that's why grown men still do it. The gay ones, anyway. Nostalgia. I have gay friends who are out and proud, have long-term partners, go to pubs and clubs. But they still cottage. Some of them take a packed lunch and a flask of tea. [Pause] Ring me, Steven. You don't belong in a toilet. [Light slowly down on HUTTON. Lights up on rest of the space. The two men go into the toilet. Birdsong. STEVE has his Walkman on. For a few moments he and LINDA sit in silence. LINDA is restless. STEVE occasionally glances back at the toilet.]
LINDA
Well, at least you could talk to me! [Pause. STEVE continues to listen to his Walkman.] I'm really nervous. [Pause] Look, you said the gorgeous Glen was
STEVE
[Reacting and talking too loudly because he has his Walkman on] IS IT HIM? SHIT! HE'LL TURN UP.
LINDA
[Indicating Walkman] Shhhhh!
STEVE
[Taking Walkman off]
LINDA
Listen, babe, I really think he would have been—[STEVE puts headphones back on.] Oooh! Steven Carter, I really hate you sometimes! I could be at home now, locked in my room with my maths revision. But I'm sitting here with you so you can be locked in your room with Tom Cruise. Or at least his eyes. Men! I put up with a lot from you, you know. All your moans. Your problems. Want to hear some of my problems? Want to hear about period pains or fanny farts or feeling as fat as a pig every time you see a supermodel? They're not problems, are they? Oh, no. Don't talk to me about problems.
STEVE
[Taking off headphones] Sorry?
LINDA
I said don't talk to me about problems.
STEVE
Okay. [Pause] He probably got held up.
LINDA
By his balls, I hope. Look, Steve, I've got to go. If he turns up, I'll only be in the way and embarrassed, and anyway I don't even fancy Tom Cruise—any part of him—so I'll call you later to see how you got on. Pythagoras awaits. [Kisses him and starts to leave]
STEVE
Lins? [She stops.] What's a fanny fart? [Exit LINDA.] Women! [He looks at his watch, gets up, starts to leave, then steels himself and heads for the toilet.]
STRANGER
[Whispering] Don't. It's too busy. Dangerous.
STEVE
Got anywhere to go?
STRANGER
No. You?
STEVE
I live round the corner. There's no one there.
STRANGER
I'm not sure.
STEVE
Go on. It's not far
STRANGER
Okay.
STEVE
I'll see you outside. On the bench. [He zips up and leaves.]
STEVE
Come on! Come out! [Pause] Come out! Come on! [He is looking back at the toilet. Eventually the stranger comes out. It is JOHN. STEVE rises slowly and JOHN stops dead in his tracks.] Jesus! [He sits down and buries his face in his hands.] I don't believe it. [Looks around again] Please, God! Tell me this isn't happening. [He faces front again. JOHN unfreezes, starts to leave, then stops and walks slowly to the bench. Sits.]
JOHN
Alright, mate. [STEVE is unable to speak.] Carter, isn't it?
STEVE
Yes.
JOHN
You live round here, then?
STEVE
Yes. Just ... not far.
JOHN
Fag?
STEVE
Sorry.
JOHN
Ciggy?
STEVE
Oh, I... ta! [He takes one. JOHN lights it and his own.]
JOHN
We only moved here a few weeks ago. [Pause] I was ... I was just exploring the area. Nice park.
STEVE
Yeah. Nice. [He coughs because of the cigarette.]
JOHN
Filthy habit.
STEVE
What is?
JOHN
Smoking. I only started because all my mates did. Peer pressure they call it. Makes you do all sorts of things you don't want to—peer pressure.
STEVE
Oh yeah. Peer pressure, I mean—[Coughs]
JOHN
Not very good at that, are you?
STEVE
No, I don't usually. That is ... I don't.
JOHN
[Smiling] Peer pressure?
STEVE
Pressure, anyway. [STEVE stubs out the cigarette.] Look, Westhead, I really should be going. Last exam tomorrow.
JOHN
How are they going? And my name's John.
STEVE
Oh, you know. I'll be glad when they're over.
JOHN
Then what?
STEVE
Sixth form next year. Imagine, two more years of that dump.
JOHN
Yeah, can't say I'll miss the old place.
STEVE
What are your plans?
JOHN
Year off. Travel round Europe. Spot the cliché, eh? Then Oxford, I hope.
STEVE
Wow! Great!
JOHN
[Looking into space] Yeah. Great. [Pause]
STEVE
Listen, Westhead ... I mean, John. What happened just now. In there. [JOHN continues to look out front.] Well, I'm sorry if I...
JOHN
Forget it. My mistake.
STEVE
Mistake?
JOHN
Mistake.
STEVE
Why? Did you think I was somebody else?
JOHN
Of course not. I mean ... I just went in for a piss, okay! I... I don't know what came over me.
STEVE
In there it's usually a question of not knowing who came over you.
JOHN
Yeerrk!
STEVE
Don't you start. [Pause] I didn't know it was you—
JOHN
Well, I certainly didn't know it was you!
STEVE
I mean, I could tell you were young ... good looking.
JOHN
Does that make a difference, then?
STEVE
Of course it makes a bloody difference.
JOHN
It's true, then? What the other guys say. That you're ... dodgy.
STEVE
I've been called worse things. Yes, I'm dodgy.
JOHN
Fuck me! [Realises what he has said] I don't mean ... I just mean ... fuck me! Sorry.
STEVE
I'm not.
JOHN
You mean you like it! You're glad to be ...
STEVE
Delighted ... to be dodgy.
JOHN
Fuck me!
STEVE
Can't say I'm keen on being kicked to shit every day, but it has its compensations.
JOHN
Such as?
STEVE
It's fun. [They stare at each other a few seconds.]
JOHN
You going to the disco tomorrow?
STEVE
Maybe.
JOHN
Not really your scene, I guess.
STEVE
Yes it is.... I mean, I love dancing.
JOHN
Me, too.
STEVE
Bet you're really good.
JOHN
Not bad. When I'm pissed. Anyone can dance when they're pissed.
STEVE
They think they can. [Nervous laugh from both] Well, like I said, I've got revision to do.
JOHN
Oh yeah. What is it tonight?
STEVE
Geography. I hate geography!
JOHN
I used to love it.
STEVE
Oxbow lakes, erratic boulders. Boring or what! [Pause] John, about what happened. I won't ... I mean, I couldn't ... Well, don't worry. I won't tell anyone.
JOHN
Yeah, I used to really get off on geography. [Pause] Thanks.
STEVE
[Getting up] See you, then.
JOHN
Catch you later.
STEVE
[After a pause] Listen, I don't suppose you fancy coming back for a coffee. My parents are out. Not that they'd mind, about the coffee. I mean, what's theirs is mine.
JOHN
Better not. Things to do. Anyway, I don't like coffee.
STEVE
Oh. Right. See you, then. [He runs off. JOHN waits, then gets up.]
JOHN
Steve. Steven. I like tea.
HUTTON
Sometimes, Steven, nothing makes sense. There are no rules. You see, those of us who cope, who grow up well adjusted, we're still at the mercy of the army of the confused. The legion of the totally fucked up! [He looks at JOHN as if he is in the same scene.] They want to have their cake and gobble it! They want the fun without the danger. The thrill without the stigma. I remember Kerry wanting me to meet her new boyfriend. She was a really good mate and had been to clubs with me often. Said she felt safe in gay places. Unthreatened. She was also one of the "why are all the best-looking men gay?" brigade. Anyway, I think she wanted me to meet this guy because he was proof that some straight men can be good looking, too! And boy was he good looking. The three of us spent a really strained evening in a pub. He hardly acknowledged me. No eye contact. Well, eventually he drove us home and dropped Kerry off first, which was odd. When we got to my place, he asked to use the loo, and when he'd finished, he came into my room and started taking his clothes off. In silence. And I watched. And he lay on the bed. And I remember thinking what a good mate Kerry was ... and then I thought about what a lovely body he had. And I got on top of him and tried to kiss him. And he said ... he said, "No! I don't want any of that queer stuff. Just fuck me!" Make sense of that. [Light down on HUTTON and lights up on bedroom. Music is now coming from the stereo. JOHN is looking through STEVE's record collection.]
JOHN
Fuck me! Abba! Bananarama! [He finds the Jason Donovan calendar.]
STEVE
[Entering with two mugs] You did say no sugar, didn't you? [JOHN is embarrassesd at being caught.] Here.
JOHN
Ta.
STEVE
Sit down. There's only the bed, I'm afraid. [JOHN sits. Pause] Is it okay?
JOHN
The bed?
STEVE
The tea.
JOHN
Oh. Yeah, great.
STEVE
Biscuit?
JOHN
No, thanks. Mind if I smoke?
STEVE
Well, I don't, but my parents—
JOHN
Oh yeah. Of course. Stupid of me.
STEVE
It's okay. I'll open a window.
JOHN
No. Don't worry.
STEVE
And I can whizz round with Mr. Sheen after you've gone.
JOHN
What?
STEVE
We haven't got any air freshener. My mum'll think I've been cleaning my room. I always use it after ... people have been here.
JOHN
It's okay. Honest. As I said—filthy habit. Why don't you sit down?
STEVE
Thanks. I mean, okay. [Heperches uncomfortably on bed.]
JOHN
[Takes a biscuit] Nice room.
STEVE
Thanks. [They both drink and munch in silence.]
JOHN
Do you fancy him, then?
STEVE
Who?
JOHN
Jason Donovan?
STEVE
Oh ... well ... sorry, I feel a bit embarrassed now.
JOHN
Why?
STEVE
Well, I've never really talked about it to a bloke before.
JOHN
It's alright. I'm just. .. interested. Intrigued. Well, do you fancy him?
STEVE
Jason? Well, I wouldn't kick him out of bed for [notices JOHN is about to take a bite] . . . anything.
JOHN
How long have you known ... that you're ...
STEVE
Dodgy? Well, I can remember ... I remember going away with the cubs when I was eight. There was a dirty mag passing around—it was called Big Ones—and all the other boys, all the other eight -year-old boys, thought it was great and said things like "Fwoooor!" and decided which girl they most fancied. Then one boy—Tony Hatton—said quite openly to me, "Don't know what all the fuss is about. I'd rather see another boy's willy any day." And I said ... "So would I." Looking back on it, he was offering me a "show me yours and I'll show you mine" situation. But I didn't realise. We went and flew a kite instead.
JOHN
Fuck me! Eight years old.
STEVE
[Getting up to change the record] Any requests?
JOHN
[Making himself comfortable on the bed by moving up it so he is sitting with his back to the headboard] Yeah! No more Abba.
STEVE
Jimmy Sommerville.
JOHN
Okay. I like some of their stuff.
STEVE
Ever listen to the lyrics?
JOHN
No. Good stuff, though. To dance to.
STEVE
[Having put on a record, "There's More to Love," Bronski Beat] Fancy a dance? Sorry, joke! [STEVE sits next to JOHN.]
JOHN
Do your parents know?
STEVE
No one knows officially. Except Linda. And you now. The wankers at school don't beat me up because I'm gay. They do it because I don't play football or smoke. Because I'm different. An easy target. If it wasn't me, it would be someone else.
JOHN
I'm sorry. [He puts his hand on STEVE's leg.]
STEVE
Sorry?
JOHN
Yeah. Worse than that, I feel guilty. I see what they do to you, and I want to help, but I can't. Sorry.
STEVE
Don't be. The other day was worse than usual. Because you were there, and they made me look a right tit ... in front of ... [They stare at each other briefly.]
STEVE
Where was I?
JOHN
Your parents.
STEVE
Oh yeah. I suppose I'll tell them one day. I don't think my dad will understand.
JOHN
Because he's Catholic?
STEVE
That's part of it. It's just that I don't think he'd ... comprehend. I remember watching a film with him once. It was a western—he loves westerns—but this was a sort of send-up. Anyway, there was this red Indian in it who was as camp as a row of ... wigwams! He was obviously dodgy, but the penny didn't drop with my dad until he started snogging this cowboy. I was sitting there wondering if this was how the Village People started when my dad said, "He's a gay!" Rather bravely I said, "So?" To which Daddy replied, "But he can't be. He's a red Indian!" You see, he couldn't cope with two stereotypes overlapping. So I guess he wouldn't cope with me being gay. I can't be, you see? I'm his son. That's my stereotype. My role. He would be as shocked as if I said, "Sit down, Dad. I've got something to tell you. I'm a red Indian." [They laugh. JOHN moves his hand up STEVE's leg to his groin. JOHN puts his hand inside STEVE's trousers. STEVE rolls on top of JOHN, and briefly they fumble and grope. Then STEVE tries to kiss JOHN. JOHN suddenly pushes STEVE off and sits on the foot of the bed.]
JOHN
Don't!
STEVE
What?
JOHN
I can't handle that.
STEVE
Kissing? Hey, don't panic. Lots of gay blokes don't like kissing.
JOHN
I'M NOT GAY! [Pause] Look, I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm here. I only came for a coffee.
STEVE
You don't like coffee.
JOHN
Stop being so fucking clever. [Pause. JOHN sees STEVE is hurt.] Look, I'm sorry. I'm really glad we talked, and I think it's great the way you cope, but... well, I guess I just made—
STEVE
A mistake. Me, too.
JOHN
I'd better go.
STEVE
I'll see you out.
JOHN
[Getting up] It's okay. I can manage. Bye. [Leaves]
STEVE
Look—
JOHN
[Calling from offstage] Just leave it!
STEVE
[Calling after him from bedroom door] John. John! Don't worry. I won't tell [front door slams.] ... anyone. Promise. [He picks up a can of Mr. Sheen and sprays the room as the music builds to a crescendo.]
MR
Gentlemen. As usual at this last assembly of the year I have much to say to the outgoing sixth form. I would like to highly praise John Westhead and his Sixth Form Council for their sterling work during the last twelve months. I think particularly of the charity swim, which raised eight thousand pounds for those less fortunate than ourselves.
O
00 p.m.
KEV
Well done, Johnny boy!
DAVE
Let's hold the famous trophy. [There is general playing around with the trophy and laughter. STEVE watches from a distance.]
KEV
What are you staring at, Carter.
STEVE
Nothing, I was just—
KEV
[Approaching him aggressively] Just what?
JOHN
Er ... Kev. [KEVIN stops. All the boys look at JOHN.] Take this back to Pubic. It's got to go back in the display cabinet. [He holds out the trophy to KEV, who looks at STEVE, then takes the trophy and exits. The other boys disperse, one of them kicking STEVE in the backside as he does. JOHN and STEVE remain.]
STEVE
Thanks.
JOHN
What for?
STEVE
You know.
JOHN
Oh. Forget it. [Pauses] Catch you later. [Exit JOHN. STEVE freezes.]
MUM
Steve. Steven! What are you doing up there? Linda's been here half an hour. You'll be late. Steven!
STEVE
[Callingfrom offstage] Coming. I'm coming!
MUM
What he does up there I'll never know. Probably cleaning his room again. He's forever cleaning his room!
LINDA
It's alright, Mrs. Carter. I'm early. Anyway, we don't want to get there too
MUM
For what?
LINDA
You know ... getting off.
MUM
Getting off where? [Pause] Oh! Getting OFF!
LINDA
It finishes at 11
MUM
Well, you and Steve can avoid the rush hour. You've got each other.
LINDA
Right.
MUM
Linda, love.
LINDA
Yes.
MUM
[Sitting] Talking about you and Steve. I hope you don't think I'm prying ... but I'm worried.
LINDA
Oh?
MUM
You're very close to Steven, aren't you?
LINDA
Very.
MUM
This is so delicate. I really can't bring myself to speak to him about it. You see ... I know.
LINDA
My God!
MUM
It's alright, love. Steven's father and I have always tried to have an open attitude to these things. Mainly because he's an only child. We want him to have a healthy attitude to sex. But 1 do worry.
MUM
But Linda. It's your problem really.
LINDA
It's not a problem.
MUM
Oh, but it could be. And ... well, call me old-fashioned, but it's your responsibility in the end. Men don't worry about these things.
LINDA
What things?
MUM
Babies, Linda. Babies. As I was saying, it's obvious that Steven and you are very close. That you must... "get off" from time to time. You're both at an age where you may want to go further. It's natural. But just be careful, Linda. We'd love a grandchild, but not just yet!
LINDA
[Relieved] Thank God! Er ... thank God you're so open about ... it!
MUM
Just you be safe.
LINDA
Don't worry. Steven and I are safer than you can possibly imagine.
MUM
Good girl. [Calling from door] Steven, will you hurry up? It's supposed to be the girl who keeps the boy waiting. And I've got a train to catch.
LINDA
Where are you going?
MUM
London, Brian's mother really is very low. She probably won't last the weekend. Marvellous old woman. So wise. She usually ends up comforting us when we visit! The other day she said, "Don't worry about me, dear. I've enjoyed my life. I've had good kids, and they've given me wonderful grandchildren. That's what it's all about," she said. "Life. Seeing your grandchildren before you pop off so you know it's all going to continue. That you've done something for the world." She's so right.
LINDA
I suppose that Steven has a great responsibility to you ... being an only child and that.
MUM
How do you mean?
LINDA
Well, what if he didn't want children?
MUM
Don't be silly, love. Everyone wants children. Just not right now, okay!
STEVE
[Entering. He should have on a white T-shirt.] Taraaagh! Will I do?
LINDA
You'll do for me.
MUM
Overdone it with the aftershave, though.
STEVE
Don't you start.
LINDA
It's not as if you need to shave!
STEVE
Bitch!
MUM
Steven! That's no way to talk to a lady!
STEVE
I'm talking to Linda. Anyway, just think of it as my "instead-of shave."
MUM
You know what your father says when you put too much on.
LINDA
What?
MUM
He says, "My God, Steven. You smell like a bloody poof."
LINDA
Really?
STEVE
I've told him, "Dad, it says, 'For Men' on the bottle. 'Savage Instinct, Pour Hommes.'" He says, "Funny sort of hommes if you ask me."
MUM
Well, have a nice time the pair of you. I'll ring if there's any news. [Kisses STEVE] Bye, Linda, and remember what I said to you. [Exit]
STEVE
Oh, yeah. "What is't, Ophelia, she hath said to you?"
LINDA
You'll never believe it. I nearly died. I thought she was going to ask if you were gay. Instead, it seems she's scared shitless you're going to get me pregnant.
STEVE
Blimey. What did you say?
LINDA
I told her we were always safe!
STEVE
"Homosexuality. The ultimate contraceptive."
LINDA
I thought that was your aftershave.
STEVE
Piss off. I'm a real homme, I am. It says so on the bottle. Now come on. You're making us late.
LINDA
Steve, do you think you'll ever, well ... would you like a child?
STEVE
No, thanks. I've eaten already. [They exit.]
KEV
What a fucking disaster!
DAVE
It's early yet.
KEV
Bollocks it is! It's 10
DAVE
John's dancing. Still, it's alright for him. He's good at it.
KEV
Yeah! I just look like I've got a food mixer stuck up my arse. How am I supposed to pull looking like that?
DAVE
[Offering him a drink] Don't panic. Try this.
KEV
Please! No more soft drinks! I'm pissing Coke. I hate the stuff.
DAVE
Not this stuff you won't. Go on; try it.
KEV
[Takes a swig] Wow! Now that's what I call the real thing! How did you—
DAVE
Forward planning. I stashed a bottle of whisky in the loo earlier today. Everytime I feel like a top-up, I go to the bog!
KEV
Clever cunt! [Goes for another swig]
DAVE
Hey, go easy! [Takes back the drink]
JOHN
[Entering from disco. He should also wear a white shirt.] God, I'm pissed1
DAVE
How are you getting on with Jenny?
JOHN
Oh, she's playing the fucking ice maiden as usual. Thawing, though. She actually danced with me just now. Well, I think it was me. She looked at me a couple of times.
KEV
Fiver says you don't pull her.
JOHN
Done! Watch this, men. [Empties his glass quickly. Goes towards disco. STEVE and LINDA enter from the disco, where they have been dancing. STEVE and JOHN bump into each other. They look at each other briefly as LINDA continues to the table. JOHN continues into the disco. DAVE does, too. STEVE slowly goes back to the door to the disco, and through it he watches JOHN dance offstage. LINDA continues To the table, and KEVIN hones in on her.]
KEV
Hi. I'm Kevin. And you are?
LINDA
Thirsty. Steve! [He ignores her.]
KEV
Hi. Having a good time?
LINDA
Until five seconds ago. Steve. Coke? Steve. Save me!
KEV
Fancy a real drink?
LINDA
No, thanks.
KEV
Something else. Er ... Diet Coke? [She ignores him. Pause.] You're not a bad-lookin girl, you know. I Mean, just because you're a bit. . .
LINDA
Fat.
LINDA
Fat.
KEV
Big. I mean, cuddly. I like cuddly girls.
LINDA
[To herself] Jesus! Steven. Oh, for God's sake!
KEV
So ... Kirsty, what are you doing after? Fancy a kebab?
LINDA
I don't think so.
KEV
Well, I could see you home. Where did you say you lived?
LINDA
I didn't. Anyway, Steven's seeing me home.
KEV
Steven? [Looks at STEVE, who is still looking at the dance floor] You mean you and Carter ... fuck me!
LINDA
No, thanks.
KEV
Your loss, darling.
LINDA
I'll live.
KEV
[Meeting STEVE as he goes towards the disco] So you're not a bender after all, Carter. Still, not exactly an oil painting, is she?
LINDA
[Hearing this and going over to him] No, she's not. She's cuddly, and until a few seconds ago you assumed in your superior, male, egotistical way that because I am a fat girl instead of a slim oil painting, I should be gagging for the delights of a quick shish followed by a quick grope.
STEVE
Linda!
LINDA
Because, mate, there are only fifteen minutes to go and you haven't pulled yet. I can't imagine why! What girl, especially a fat, unattractive girl, could resist you? Fag breath, shit-for-brains, and zits, too! I can just imagine sex with you. The pathetic fumbling to undo a bra strap. The slobbery kisses. Belching into some poor girl's mouth because you've had too much chili sauce. And then the main event, which is either over in seconds or not at all because you're too fucking pissed!
KEV
Shall I take that as a definite no?
STEVE
Take it up your bum!
KEV
I thought that was your boyfriend's department. [About to go] Oi, Carter. Why did God make poofs? So that fat women would have someone to go out with. [Exit to disco]
STEVE
Calm down, Lins.
LINDA
God! His sort make me sick. Just because he's got a willy, he thinks he's God's gift to womankind.
STEVE
Personkind.
LINDA
What?
STEVE
Nothing. Anyway, he's not that bad. One of the better ones. He's probably pissed. I found a bottle of whisky in the bog earlier today. Guess what I did.
LINDA
Shock me.
STEVE
I poured some of it away.
LINDA
Ooooh! You devil!
STEVE
And pissed in the bottle.
LINDA
I'm shocked.
STEVE
Revenge is mine!
LINDA
You evil little git. [Pause] How's the beautiful John doing with Jenny Keeley?
STEVE
How should I know?
LINDA
Well, I assume that's who you were staring at while I was being chatted up by something out of Jurassic Park.
STEVE
God! He's such a good dancer.
LINDA
Babes! Stop torturing yourself. He's straight. And stop staring at him.
STEVE
I can't. Anyway. He stares back.
LINDA
In your wildest dreams!
STEVE
Lins ... Oh, God. I've got to tell someone. What the fuck! You see, yesterday—
LINDA
[A dance record begins next door. It should be raunchy, rhythmic, and sexy.
S
"Ride on Time" by Black Box.] Oh! I love this one. Come on! Let's dance.
STEVE
I don't feel like it.
LINDA
Oh, stop feeling so sorry for yourself! [Exit to dance floor]
LINDA
[Pushing him away] Hey! Don't you start.
STEVE
Sorry. I thought you were someone else.
LINDA
Charming. I'll get our coats. Alright if I call a cab from your place? [Exit.
STEVE
Hi.
JOHN
Having a good time?
STEVE
Great. You?
JOHN
Great. How's your nan?
STEVE
Just about hanging on. My parents have gone to London to be with her.
JOHN
Oh. Sorry.
STEVE
You're a wonderful dancer.
JOHN
You, too.
JENNY
[Entering with her jacket.] Come on, Head Boy. How about that curry, then?
JOHN
Oh ... sure. Er, Jenny, this is Steve. Steve, Jenny.
JENNY
Hallo.
STEVE
[Ignoring her] I'd better go. Linda's waiting. Have a nice ... curry. [Exit]
JENNY
Rude little boy.
JOHN
He's alright.
JENNY
How about it, then. The place by the cinema's good.
JOHN
What? Oh. Listen, Jenny, I wonder if you'd mind if we didn't.... I mean, I've got a bit of a headache.
JENNY
That's supposed to be my line.
JOHN
And I really should help clear up here.
KEVIN
[Overhearing] That's alright, mate. We can manage. Anyway, got nothing better to do. [To JENNY] What's the matter with the girls at your place? Frigid or what?
JENNY
There we are, John. Your charming friend has offered to stand in for you. And I'm sure I can find a way to soothe your poor little head. [She tries to touch him.]
JOHN
Backoff!
JENNY
I'm sorry. I just thought—
JOHN
Well, you thought wrong! Leave it. Okay! Just leave it! And as for you [to KEVIN], you can stand in for me wherever you like. [Exit]
KEVIN
Hey! That's a fiver you owe me. [Turns to JENNY] You heard the man. Fancy a kebab? [She slaps him and exits.] Shit!
HUTTON
Shit! Shit! What can I tell you? Seize the day. For fuck's sake, seize the day. Seize it! Grab it! Enjoy it! [The lights change, and we are in STEVE's bedroom. STEVE and LINDA sit on the end of the bed staring into space.]
LINDA
Well, I don't see what all the fuss is about. If you ask me, they deserve each other. Two spoilt little rich kids. Superior, arrogant—
STEVE
Don't! Don't talk about him like that. He's not like that.
LINDA
Sorry I spoke! [Pause] Just trying to cheer you up.
STEVE
Don't bother. I'm uncheerupable. I want to die.
LINDA
God! It really does get boring sometimes. You don't have a monopoly on rejection, you know. At least you're not me.
STEVE
Cuddly.
LINDA
Sweetheart. I am not cuddly, not a big girl, not well rounded. I am absolutely fucking enormous. The only offers I get are from dickheads like Kevin "Shit-for-brains" and even then only after he's tried every other girl in the place. At the end of the evening. Dancing with the desperate. [Together after a pause]
LINDA 
Men!
LINDA
So you see, I've got more to hate Jenny Keeley for than you.
STEVE
That's all you know.
LINDA
So what don't I know.
STEVE
Nothing. Can't say. I promised. You wouldn't believe me anyway. I'm not sure I believe me!
LINDA
[Doorbell rings] Suit yourself. That's my cab. [Kisses him] Thanks for tonight, babe. And forget about John Westhead. Plenty more sharks in the sea. [Pause] You're a really good dancer, you know?
STEVE
So I'm told.
LINDA
[Doorbell again] Okay, okay, I'm coming, Love ya!
STEVE
Me, too! [Exit LINDA. STEVE gets up and starts getting undressed. The front door slams. Footsteps are heard coming upstairs. STEVE is examining his face in the mirror in the fourth wall] Did you forget something? [He freezes, looking in the mirror as JOHN enters. Slowly he turns, and JOHN moves slowly into the room. They stare at each other.]
JOHN
Help ... me. Please. PLEASE HELP ME! [Music crescendo. Slow blackout.]
HUTTON
Out. Out. What does it mean? In the closet. Out of the closet. Into the ghetto. Simon Hutton, by day mild-mannered teacher of history, by night the dancing queen. I used to love the scene. When I was growing up in the closetdom of Croydon, I couldn't wait until I was old enough to go to London all on my own. London, with its bars and its clubs. London, where the streets were paved with men. Where I wouldn't have to be afraid anymore. Where I wouldn't have to hide. I was nineteen when I plucked up the courage to go to a gay club. To "Heaven." Christ, I didn't know there were that many gay people in the whole world. I was young then. And that night, for the first time in my life I realised that not only was I young, but I was beautiful. Desirable. Wanted. I realised I didn't have to do it with the first old queen who flashed at me in a cottage. But I was young and vulnerable, and even there I was still afraid. I still wanted to hide. But something kept me there and has kept me going back for years. The
MAN 
I haven't seen you here before.
MAN 
No. I don't like these places.
MAN 
Oh, me neither, I hate the scene.
MAN 
[Separate group] You don't look like a Sagittarian.
MAN 
Well, I'm not typical.
MAN 
It's all so shallow, don't you think?
MAN 
Very shallow. People just don't talk to each other.
MAN 
Oh, I know!
MAN 
Do you live in London?
MAN 
Yes. But ... I live with my boyfriend.
MAN 
It's very cynical. People only come here for sex. Sex, sex, sex!
MAN 
I live in London, too.
MAN 
Good.
MAN 
On my own.
MAN 
Good.
MAN 
Sex, sex, sex. I sometimes think it's all gay men think about.
MAN 
Oh, I know.
MAN 
Do you have a car?
MAN 
No.
MAN 
Oh.
MAN 
It's so shallow.
MAN 
Cynical.
MAN 
Meaningless. [Pause] Would you like to spank me?
MAN 
You're really cute.
MAN 
Tie me up?
MAN 
Lovely eyes.
MAN 
Cover me in cling-film?
MAN 
What travel zone are you? [Lights down on men]
HUTTON
But that's the choice. In the closet or on the scene. At least on the scene you can pretend you're happy. Even at my age. Even when you're not beautiful anymore. A few pints inside you, turn the music up, stick a bottle of poppers up your nose, and you can conquer the world. And besides . .. everyone looks beautiful in ultraviolet.
JOHN
Please. Help me. I need ... I need to use your loo.
STEVE
Didn't they have one in the Star of Bengal?
JOHN
What? Oh. I wasn't hungry. [Shows him a bottle of whisky] I found this. Have some if you like.
STEVE
Er ... no thanks. First on the right.
JOHN
[Exiting] Thanks.
STEVE
[When JOHN exits, STEVE picks up his shirt but can't decide if he should put it on. In the end he does. Picks up his aftershave and puts some on. Reads the bottle. Puts more on.] Carpe diem. Carpe diem. [Picks up the whisky but quickly puts it down. Leaps on bed in time to look nonchalant as JOHN enters.]
JOHN
[Entering] That girl—Linda?—she gave me such a strange look.
STEVE
She's good at those.
JOHN
And then she said, "Men!" and got into a cab. What did she mean?
STEVE
Oh, she's just being ... Linda. [JOHN goes to pick up the whisky.] Er, I don't think you should drink that.
JOHN
You don't approve?
STEVE
No. I just think you've had enough.
JOHN
I haven't had nearly enough.
STEVE
[They are both now holding the bottle and struggling for it.] Please, John. Don't. I—
JOHN
Fuck off.
STEVE
Look, I really think—[The bottle falls on the floor and spills. Pause.] Ooops! Another job for Mr. Sheen. [JOHN sinks to his knees and begins to cry.] Sorry. Look, it's only a bottle of whisky. I'll buy you another one. With no extra additives.
JOHN
Please. Help me! Please. I'm so scared. So fucking scared.
STEVE
I know.
JOHN
And confused.
STEVE
I know.
JOHN
You don't fucking know. You're not confused. What gives you the right to be not confused?
STEVE
I'm getting there. [JOHN suddenly kisses him aggressively.] Coffee?
JOHN
I don't like coffee.
STEVE
You don't like kissing. [They look at each other and kiss again, this time much more slowly and affectionately.]
JOHN
The other day in the toilet—you see, when I said it was the first time, I wasn't lying. It was the first time ... in there. But... but it wasn't the first time ever. [He doesn't look at STEVE as he talks.] Last summer. Brighton. Amanda. God, I'm so pissed.
STEVE
Take your time.
JOHN
Me and Amanda. My ex-girlfriend. We went to Brighton for a week last summer. It was lovely. Walks along the beach. Kissing in the moonlight. All that romantic crap. Sounds naff, doesn't it?
STEVE
Sounds wonderful.
JOHN
One night Amanda had to go and visit some relatives or something, so I went and had a drink on my own. I was walking back to the hotel along the beach, and I got to the old pier, you know, the derelict one. As I was walking under it, I noticed a couple of blokes in the shadows. I remember clenching my keys in my hand so I could deck them if they tried to mug me. But then ... then I noticed that there weren't two of them. In the shadows, behind the pillars, everywhere ... there were men. I stopped. I still don't know why. And then I moved behind a pillar and watched. And ... and I realised that I was ... you know ... aroused. I thought it was just the mystery, the danger. But then this bloke creeps over to me. And I look at him, and even in the dark I can see that his eyes ... his eyes are beautiful. Beautiful, challenging men's eyes. And he puts his hand on my ... and I'm scared and drunk, but I'm thinking ... yes ... do it ... do it. And he tries to kiss me and I pull away and he takes his hand away but ... but I grab it ... and put it back on my... and he starts to undo my fly buttons, but he's clumsy and I do it for him. And he takes it out and starts ... slowly at first ... then faster. Suddenly I freaked and ran ... and ran as fast as I could trying to stick my ... back in my ... and I got to the hotel. Amanda was asleep. But I woke her up ... and I fucked her. And fucked her. I fucked her. But I wasn't seeing her eyes. I was seeing men's eyes. Challenging, mocking men's eyes. [Pause] For the rest of the week, every night, I had to keep going back. I found excuses to go out on my own at night—to get cigarettes, clear my head, anything. During the day I told myself I wouldn't, but the thought of what was going on under that haunted, mysterious building drew me back night after night.
STEVE
"Pier" pressure.
JOHN
I usually just watched. But on the last night it happened. With the same bloke as the first night. Those eyes ... Jesus. They seemed to look into my ... Anyway, this time I didn't stop. And it was wonderful and dangerous and so, so exciting.
STEVE
Oh, Johnny.
JOHN
But half an hour later I was lying by my girlfriend trying to explain why I didn't want to make love to her ... and I felt dishonest and frightened and so fucking dirty. And I vowed to myself never, ever to do it again. And I haven't. I really don't know why I ... with you. And I'm straight. I love sex with girls. But now I can't help thinking ... Steven, if you ever breathe a word of this, I'll—
STEVE
I won't. I ... like you too much.
JOHN
I like you, too. It's just ... oh God. What's wrong with me? [He cries.]
STEVE
Shhh! Don't worry. It's alright. Shhh.
JOHN
God. I'm so drunk. [STEVE lays JOHN down on the bed and goes to put
STEVE
Listen. You can ... I mean, don't think I'm ... but you can ... if you want ... you can stay here tonight. You can sleep in here and I'll go into—
JOHN
Don't leave me. Please. Please.
STEVE
Okay. [They stare at each other and then kiss. STEVE starts to caress JOHN slowly.]
JOHN
[Whispering] Yes. Yes. Do it.
STEVE
[Whispering] Johnny. There's nothing wrong with you. [Lights down on them as they lie down on the bed. Lights up on HUTTON.]
HUTTON
It can be so beautiful, Steven, I was so in love once. Beautiful. He was. Romance. He kept ... again and again. I'd be so scared ... fumbling in the dark ... silent sex ... and he'd say ... no, I can't. And I never used to mind because HE was there, and I really only wanted ... touch ... hold him ... see those eyes. And I'd kiss him on the forehead ... safe sex ... and go to sleep. And then I'd wake up because he'd be all over me ... and then he'd stop and say he couldn't ... and I felt ... dirty ... MY fault. It went on for years. But the confusion, it was made bearable by ... the love. Love. The beautiful moments. By the sea once. He was standing on a jetty looking out to the ocean. And he turned to face me ... and behind him the most incredible sunset exploding on the water in a blaze of colour. And there in front of me ... the most beautiful ... angel ... eyes ... perfection. And I felt a surge inside me which was nothing to do with my ... Overwhelming. Privileged. Moment in time. And I cried because of the impossibility of that moment. And it happened to me. It HAPPENED. To ME. Fuck the sex. Live the romance, Steve. Live the love.
RADIO
—report on this beautiful Sunday morning. I've got a request for Julie on her birthday. Julie, Derek says he loves you very much and that the last year and
JOHN
Steven.
STEVE
[Calling from offstage] I'm getting breakfast. I'm afraid we had all the bacon yesterday.
JOHN
What time are your parents due back?
STEVE
They're back. They're down here with me.
JOHN
Shit!
STEVE
Mum says if you make an honest man of me, she'll help you choose the curtains.
JOHN
You wanker! Wanker. Steve. Can I let my parents know I'll be home soon?
STEVE
How soon?
JOHN
Look, I've been here all weekend. I told them I was at Kevin's. Can I?
STEVE
Be my guest.
JOHN
Ta. [As he dials and waits for an answer, he picks up and examines a half-empty bottle of baby oil from beside the bed.] Hi, Mum. Listen, I'm still at Kevin's, but I'll ... What? When? ... Oh, er .. well, we had a bit of a row last night, and I ... I went and stayed at Dave's. I've ... I've just come back here this morning. [Pause] Who? Oh, Jenny. Yes, she is nice.... You did what? No. Sorry. Of course. [Pause] Look, apologise to Dad for worrying him. I'm really sorry. I'll be home for lunch.... Look, I must go. I'm on someone else's ... I mean, Kevin's phone. See you later. [Puts down phone] Shit. Shit!
STEVE
[Entering] Marmalade or honey?
JOHN
Oh ... I'm not fussed.
STEVE
[Sitting on edge of bed and pouring tea] You know, I was thinking about what you said about going away together this summer. What about Brighton? It would be—[He stops as he notices that JOHN is trying to put his underpants on under the covers.] What are you doing?
JOHN
Getting dressed.
STEVE
But why—why so shy all of a sudden? We've been making love all weekend, and now you don't want me to see your willy?
JOHN
Just leave it alone, will you?
STEVE
It's you who can't leave it alone. [Pause. As STEVE returns to the tea, JOHN comes forward on the bed and hugs STEVE from behind.]
JOHN
Sorry. [Kisses him on cheek] It's just ... this is all so ... strange.
STEVE
You'll get used to it. [JOHN continues to dress.]
JOHN
I won't ... it's ... not me.
STEVE
Who is it, then?
JOHN
Even if I got used to the ... sex, I couldn't get used to the lying. Apparently Kevin rang last night.
STEVE
Shit.
JOHN
I think I managed to squirm out of it with my mum. But I hated lying to her. She and Dad have been worried sick.
JOHN
And Jenny rang as well, and Mum gave her Kevin's number. What am I going to say to her? Or Kevin? And then there's that Linda. What if she—
STEVE
She won't say anything.
JOHN
[Taking STEVE's hand] Steve. I'm scared. I've never had to cover up about what I do before.
STEVE
What about Brighton pier?
JOHN
That was different.
STEVE
Because you only came once that time?
JOHN
There's no need to rub it in.
STEVE
Yes there is. It's good for the complexion.
JOHN
What? Oh. [Pause] Is it?
STEVE
So I'm told.
JOHN
Listen, Steve—
STEVE
No. You listen, Johnny. Sod it. This can't work.
JOHN
Why?
STEVE
Because of all you've just said. Look, since you got here on Friday, you've come on to me, come on me in five seconds flat, told me you enjoyed it but wouldn't like to do it again, then done it again. Every time we make it, you tell me you have too much to lose by being gay, or you have to make some crappy statement about how you prefer girls. Ramming your sexuality down my throat. And then you get horny again. And ram something else down my throat. Basically I don't know if you're coming or going.
JOHN
[Holding him] I'm sorry. Please, give me a chance. [STEVE laughs.] What's the matter?
STEVE
If you knew how long ... how many nights ... and you're asking ME to give YOU a chance.
JOHN
Well?
STEVE
Tomorrow night? If my parents are still away.
JOHN
Great. I'd better go now.
STEVE
Okay. Thank you for ... coming.
JOHN
Thank you for having me. [They laugh and embrace. Freeze. Light on HUTTON only.]
HUTTON
I saw two men ... once ... opposite sides of the road. Knew each other. "Oi. Cunt!" said one. "Fucking wanker," said the other. Guess that meant "Nice to see you, my friend." If only men could ... but ... still the easiest way one man can prove he's better than another ... is to stand in an arena and hit him so many times that he draws blood or so hard that he obliterates his brain cells and he falls over. All in the name of sport. And yet me ... you, Steven ... us ... love ... affection ... [Lights up on the two boys still embracing] An act of gross indecency.
STEVE
You're beautiful. [Boys kiss as light goes down on them.]
DAD
Hallo. Steven? Listen, I've got bad news. [Pause] Yes. This morning. In her sleep. She was quite peaceful. [Pause] What? Sorry, son, I can't hear you properly. Listen, I haven't got much change. I want you to come to London for the funeral. [Pause] Tuesday, but I want you to come tomorrow. [Pause] What's the problem? Your exams are over now.... Anyway, we'll be back on Thursday. [Pause] Listen, Steven, I'm not asking you; I'm telling you. She was your bloody grandmother, for Christ's sake. If it wasn't for her ... anyway, the whole family will be here. [Pause] What do you mean "Oh, the family." Yes, the family, your family. Now get the train tomorrow. And ring the school. [Pause] What? Yes, bring her if you like. And Steven, bring a tie. [Pause] No, not a family tie, just a tie. A black tie. [He puts down the phone. The light fades on him as the schoolbell rings.]
KEVIN
It's okay, mate. I understand.
JOHN
But I was well out of order.
KEVIN
Yes, you were, you wanker.
JOHN
I just felt so ... pressured. Like every fucker at the disco was thinking, "Is he going to pull her?" Like it was inevitable. Beautiful-looking bird like Jenny. Beautiful guy like me.
KEVIN
Whoever said you were beautiful?
JOHN
You'd be surprised. Anyway, it just felt like I was going through it to prove something.
KEVIN
But you do fancy her?
JOHN
Of course I do. She's great. I rang her last night, and she's forgiven me.
KEVIN
Really? You're a lucky man. So I owe you a fiver. Typical bloody Johnny Westhead happy ending.
JOHN
I'm not sure. I mean, I'm not sure I want to get involved.
KEVIN
Who said you had to get involved. Just get IN.
JOHN
She's not that kind of girl.
KEVIN
Is it Amanda?
JOHN
What?
KEVIN
Well, ever since you two split up last summer, you don't seem ... how can I put this ... well, you don't seem very interested in ... girls.
JOHN
What are you getting at? I love girls. I do.
KEVIN
Okay, okay. Keep your hair on. I'm just trying to say you're still hung up about Amanda, that's all.
JOHN
Look, I don't want to talk about it. Okay. I'm sorry I behaved the way I did to you at the disco. Now let's drop it. Okay?
KEVIN
Okay.
JOHN
Okay.
KEVIN
I'm sorry, too. For dropping you in it with your parents.
JOHN
Forget it. You weren't to know where I was.
KEVIN
No, I wasn't, was I? [Pause] Johnny?
JOHN
Yeah.
KEVIN
Where were you? [Notices HUTTON approaching] Shit! [They quickly get rid of the cigarettes and fan the smoke away.]
HUTTON
[Entering] Ah, John. There you are.
JOHN
Sir. We were just—
HUTTON
Having a fag. Listen, I've got a message for you. Steven Carter rang in to say his grandmother died,
JOHN
So?
HUTTON
Don't be too sympathetic, will you? He's had to go to London for the funeral.
JOHN
Why are you telling me?
HUTTON
He just wanted you to know he can't make tonight, that's all. Just passing on the message, John.
JOHN
Er ... thank you, sir. [Exit HUTTON. Awkward pause.] I ... er ... I told Carter I'd let him have my... history notes. For next year.
KEVIN
Right.
JOHN
I was going to ... meet him to ... history notes.
KEVIN
Right.
JOHN
Well, catch you later.
KEVIN
Right.
JOHN
Right. [Pause] You're right about Jenny. I'm a lucky guy.
KEVIN
Yeah. See you. [JOHN and KEVIN exit to opposite sides of the stage very slowly as a church bell strikes. Lights change to a single shaft of light. Almost "heavenly."]
LINDA
You alright, babe?
STEVE
Yeah. Sorry. All that crap the priest came out with got on my tits. He didn't even know her. He got her bloody name wrong twice. God, and all my relatives looking suitably grief stricken. None of them bothered with her while she was ill.
LINDA
Your mum and dad were good to her, though.
STEVE
I know.
LINDA
They looked after her.
STEVE
I know.
LINDA
They're special.
STEVE
I know!
LINDA
[Pause] Steve. There's something else, isn't there. Something bugging you. [Pause] It's John, isn't it?
STEVE
Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh God, Lins, I'm so in love. I'm so happy. I feel guilty for feeling happy here, but I just want to yell it out—"John Westhead loves me!"
LINDA
How do you know?
STEVE
Because we've done it. Loads. And he loved it. He loved me,
LINDA
Oh, Steve.
STEVE
Look, Linda. Why can't you just be happy for me? I want to share this feeling with everyone, my mum, my dad, but I can't. So why can't you just—[He notices GEORGE.] Oh, shit, it's him.
LINDA
Who?
STEVE
Cousin George. He's about to come and talk to us. He's twenty-two and he's got the lot—company car, company girlfriend. And he says irritating things like "Pas de probleme" and "I'll give you a bell later in the week." And he calls me—
GEORGE
[Coming over] Einstein? How you hanging?
STEVE
Hallo, George.
GEORGE
How are the old exams going?
STEVE
They've gone.
GEORGE
You confident?
STEVE
Pas de probleme.
GEORGE
[To LINDA] Sorry, you must be?
STEVE
Sorry. George, this is Linda. Linda, this is boring. [STEVE goes and stands aloof.]
GEORGE
What's eating him?
LINDA
Oh, he's just thinking about his man. I mean nan.
GEORGE
Yeah. God bless her, wherever she is. [Pause] So you're Einstein's girlie. I've heard a lot about you.
LINDA
I've heard a lot about you.
GEORGE
All bad I hope.
LINDA
Yes.
GEORGE
I must say you're a bit of a surprise.
LINDA
Must you?
GEORGE
Yeah. Well, strictly between you and me, we were all a bit worried about Steven. Bit of a late starter. In the girlie department. Still, looks like you've made an honest man of him.
LINDA
No need for that. [Lights down on rest of the stage. Light only on STEVE. The relatives talk to each other in small groups.]
MUM
Well, yes, Steven was always a bit shy when it came to the opposite sex.
DAD
Linda's a lovely girl.
RETATIVE 
It was a lovely service.
RELATIVE 
We couldn't get a babysitter.
PRIEST
So many flowers.
RELATIVE 
How many have you got now?
RELATIVE 
Nice of the priest to say what a close family we are.
RELATIVE 
And they're getting married in October.
GEORGE
Top up anyone?
MUM
I don't think we've seen you since Tracy's christening.
RELATIVE 
Well, she took him back, after what he'd done.
GEORGE
Sausage roll?
PRIEST
Well, if you can't turn to the family in a crisis—
RELATIVE 
The rest of the family are dropping sprogs left, right, and centre.
RELATIVE 
And we had her first birthday party last week. She looked so cute in her little dress with all her friends round her. [The remainder of the conversation should happen almost simultaneously, the following words being clearly audible, building to a crescendo.]
GEORGE
White wedding?
RELATIVE 
If you can't turn to the family—
RELATIVE 
What a close family we are—
MUM
Only child.
DAD
Opposite—
GEORGE
Can I get anything for anyone?
DAD
Sex.
RELATIVE 
Christening.
RELATIVE 
Wedding.
RELATIVE 
Babysitter.
RELATIVE 
Lovely girl.
MUM
Lovely service.
DAD
Lovely—
ALL
FAMILY. [The lights change immediately to normal. STEVE rushes to join LINDA.]
STEVE
Lins, I've got to get out of here.
LINDA
Okay, let's go for a walk.
STEVE
No. I mean OUT. I want to go back to Basingstoke.
LINDA
Sweetheart, no one ever WANTS to go back to Basingstoke.
STEVE
I do. Tonight.
LINDA
Oh, Steve. He'll still be there on Thursday.
STEVE
And so will my parents. Tomorrow's the last chance we'll have to—
LINDA
Bonk.
STEVE
Be together, alone, touch, talk, hold each other—for ages.
LINDA
So tell your dad you're going back tonight.
STEVE
He'll freak. He says I belong here. Well, I don't. I don't fucking belong here.
LINDA
Darling, you're cracking up.
STEVE
Don't be melodramatic. [Pause] Faint.
LINDA
What?
STEVE
Just do it.
LINDA
"Don't be melodramatic. Just faint."
STEVE
Please.
LINDA
Steven Carter, I really—
STEVE
Hate me, loathe me, detest me, just faint! [LINDA faints, melodramatically. Linda! My God, she's fainted. Lins. Linda. [The family crowds round.]
MUM
Linda. Linda love.
RELATIVE 
Loosen her blouse.
RELATIVE 
Make sure she hasn't swallowed her tongue.
DAD
Get her some water.
RELATIVE 
Give her some air.
RELATIVE 
Get her on her back.
GEORGE
Sit her up.
RELATIVE 
She's coming round.
LINDA
[Very hammily] Where am I?
STEVE
Are you alright?
LINDA
What happened?
ALL
You fainted.
MUM
Now what's this all about?
LINDA
I don't know.
STEVE
She was fine a minute ago.
LINDA
I was fine a minute ago.
MUM
Do you want to go upstairs and lie down? That's alright, isn't it, Bridie?
RELATIVE 
Of course it is.
STEVE
No, it isn't. I mean, you've got to be back in Basingstoke tonight.
LINDA
I do? Oh yes, I do.
DAD
Well, you're not going home on the train alone. Steven, you'll have to go with her.
STEVE
Oh. I guess so.
LINDA
It's okay; I can manage.
STEVE
No, you can't.
MUM
Steven's right, love. Let him take you home. I'll get you some tea. [All relatives have now exited.]
STEVE
How are you feeling?
LINDA
Stupid.
STEVE
No change there, then.
LINDA
You're such a git.
STEVE
You were brilliant. Drink your tea; then Basingstoke here we come.
LINDA
Git. [Pause] He'd better be worth it; that's all I can say. [The light changes slowly to a small area. All exit except for STEVE. JOHN enters, drying himself with a towel.]
STEVE
Oh, he's worth it.. He's everything. [Schoolbell]
JOHN
It can't be worth it. Jesus. I was so fucking embarrassed,
STEVE
I've said I'm sorry. How did I know Hutton would give you the message in front of Kevin?
JOHN
No. Not embarrassed. Scared. My life flashed before me. My future life anyway. My parents crying, my friends dumping me. And the police.
STEVE
The police.
JOHN
Yeah, we broke the law, didn't we?
STEVE
The law's bollocks.
JOHN
Is it?
STEVE
Is it!
JOHN
Keep your voice down. Do you want the whole school to hear?
STEVE
Yes! [Pause] The law—
JOHN
Is there to protect us.
STEVE
From what? Who are we hurting?
JOHN
Ourselves maybe.
STEVE
Johnny, please—
DAVE
[Entering] Hurry up. Kev and I are bunking out for a pint. Bet you could do with one after what you've been doing.
JOHN
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?
DAVE
After two hours of tennis. Did you win?
JOHN
Of course.
DAVE
Stupid question.
JOHN
I'll be with you in a sec. Just doing my hair.
DAVE
Okay. We'll be in the common room. [Exit]
STEVE
[Long pause] My parents are back tomorrow. [Pause] I've no idea when my house will be free again. ¡Pause] John. Please. Please come over. Just to talk. I mean, we don't have to ... you know ... if you don't want to.
JOHN
Of course I fucking want to. But don't you see? I don't WANT to want to.
JOHN
Steve, mate—
STEVE
I'm not your mate.
JOHN
What are you, then?
STEVE
I thought I was your ... It doesn't matter.
JOHN
Look, the others are waiting. Catch you later. [Pause] I'm really sorry ... about your nan. [Exit]
STEVE
[Sits motionless on the bench, then notices JOHN has left his bag. Picks it up and goes to the door.] John, you left your—[He comes back into the room. Throws the bag violently and the contents spill out.] Bastard! Fucking bastard. [He kicks and throws the contents around. Suddenly he has JOHN's tennis shirt in his hands. Holds it to his face.] I love you, you bastard.
KEVIN
[Entering with DAVE] What the fuck! They're John's things. You little shit. Pick them up.
STEVE
Yes. Sorry. [He starts putting things back in the bag.]
KEVIN
You will be. [Grabs STEVE, pinning him against the locker. Goes to hit him.]
JOHN
[Entering] Kevin! What's going on?
KEVIN
This little queer's been going through your gear.
STEVE
Johnny, I—
JOHN
Let him go, Kev. It's my problem. I'll sort it. I said leave him.
KEVIN
[Releasing STEVE] Okay, you sort it. We'll keep watch outside. And since when does he get to call you Johnny? [Exit]
STEVE
Johnny. John. I'm sorry. I was ...
JOHN
Shut it.
STEVE
I was just so—
JOHN
I said shut it. How dare you. You've really asked for it. [He hits his bag and whispers.] Scream.
STEVE
Sorry?
JOHN
Just scream, shout, moan. [He starts hitting the bag often. STEVE responds by screaming. This goes on for awhile. They both find it very funny. JOHN grabs STEVE's lapels and shakes him as they both try to suppress their laughter. Suddenly they look at each other and stop. They are about to kiss as KEVIN enters.]
KEVIN
Someone's coming. [He notices what's happening. JOHN looks at KEVIN. He then rams STEVE's face very hard into the locker. As he hits the floor, JOHN kicks him violently.]
JOHN
Queer bastard. [Exit JOHN and KEVIN. STEVE eventually staggers to his feet. He is nearly crying as he examines his bleeding face in the mirror in the fourth wall. HUTTON enters.]
HUTTON
Jesus Christ! [He tries to examine STEVE's face, but he shrugs away.] Bastards. Steven, this can't go on. Tell me who did it. I saw Westhead leaving....
STEVE
No. No. It wasn't him. [He picks up JOHN's shirt and starts cleaning his wound with it. HUTTON notices the shirt.] He didn't mean it. It was expected. He didn't ... had to ... He ... loves me.... I know he does.... I ... I love ... [He breaks down completely.] He's the one who should be crying. He's the one who's fucked up. I know what I feel.
HUTTON
I know.
STEVE
I'm so fucking lonely.
HUTTON
I know.
STEVE
Angry. I'm so fucking angry.
HUTTON
Be angry. It helps.
STEVE
How do you know?
HUTTON
[Turning STEVE to face him] I KNOW! [Pause] Look, Steven, I've already said too much. But I will say that it gets better. You have to keep fighting.
STEVE
What about love?
HUTTON
If you want to love, you have to fight. Here's my home number. If you ever need to talk, well, please ring.
STEVE
Thanks.
HUTTON
And I'm going to talk to Mr. Ayres. Don't panic. I won't name names. I just think it's time Pubic knew just what kind of "gentlemen" he's creating. Yes, the staff call him that, too. [STEVE smiles.] He needs to know for the sake of all the others who have the right to ... you know!
STEVE
[Smiling] I know. [Exit]
JOHN
I don't want a drink. I've got to ... see you. Steven. Steve! Please help—
KEVIN
[From shadows] You just don't seem very interested in—
JOHN
[Running about to try answering the voices] I love girls. I do. Steven.
JENNY
How about that curry you promised me.
JOHN
What's wrong with me?
KEVIN
Since when does he get to call you—
STEVE
Johnny—
DAVE
After what you've been doing.
STEVE
There's nothing wrong with you.
JOHN
Steve! I LOVE—
MR
The value of the family.
JOHN
I love—
BOY 
Queer bastard.
BOY 
SC loves JW.
JOHN
I love girls. I do.
KEVIN
Where were you?
JOHN
I do!
STEVE
You have too much to lose.
JOHN
I do!
MAN 
Do you like to suck?
JOHN
I do! I do! I do! I ... LOVE ...
JOHN
STEVEN! [STEVE keeps walking.] Steven! Please stop.
STEVE
[Stopping] If you're looking for your shirt, it's in the changing room.
JOHN
Sod the shirt. Please. I just wanted to say ... sorry. I had to. Don't you see? ... I'd have lost face.
STEVE
And what about my face?
JOHN
I'm so ashamed. But I just had to.... It was—
STEVE
Peer pressure. Forget it. What's a smack in the face between lovers?
JOHN
I'm not your lover.
STEVE
Oh, sorry. Then me and your twin brother recently spent two days making love together.
JOHN
Look, can we sit down? [They go to the bench.]
STEVE
Well, we've been here before. How romantic.
JOHN
Stop talking about romance.
STEVE
I was being sarcastic. Not exactly Mills and Boon, was it? The sun was just going down, and the air was heady with the scent of urine.
JOHN
Steven, please. That's just the point. I think you do see this as romantic. That we "made love." I guess I can't ever deny what happened, but I can't relate it to love. You can't make love to a bloke.
STEVE
I can.
JOHN
It's not what I believe in, what—
STEVE
You've been taught.
JOHN
Oh, bollocks. Do you think anyone takes that garbage about "gentlemen" and family values seriously?
STEVE
Yes. Yes, I do. And even if they don't, school's not the only place you're taught. It comes at you from all sides. The family, the telly. Affection is about men and women; romance is "boy meets girl."
JOHN
Don't exaggerate.
STEVE
Listen. Don't you watch the commercials? Beautiful blokes throwing themselves into the arms of beautiful girls. What does that mean? Coca Cola is for straights only. Or how about "Say it with flowers. Let HER know you care." Or the cute little five-year-old boy who kisses the cute little five-year-old girl.
JOHN
What the fuck are you saying? That five-year-olds might be gay!
STEVE
No. No. I'm saying that five-year-olds kiss and hug and hold hands with anyone they love. And why does that stop? Because one day someone says, "Come on, you're a big boy now. Big boys don't hold hands." What a shame! What a fucking shame.
JOHN
Steven, I don't want to hurt you—but you scare me. I don't want to turn out like you.
STEVE
Dodgy?
JOHN
No. Bitter. You're already so bitter.
STEVE
I'm not bitter. I'm fucking angry.
JOHN
Don't be angry with me. I... care about you.
STEVE
Sorry. Not allowed. I'm a bloke, remember? Anyway, you're just scared if I get too angry, I'll tell people about us. Well, I won't. I couldn't.
JOHN
You're amazing. I would.
STEVE
Yeah, well, I'm not you, thank God. And anyway, I love you.
JOHN
J... thanks. [JOHN goes to touch STEVE, who gets up.] I'd better go. I've got to meet...
STEVE
Jenny?
JOHN
Yeah.
STEVE
After the way you treated her?
JOHN
I know, I'm a lucky guy.
STEVE
She's a lucky girl.
JOHN
Yeah ... well. Glad we talked. No hard feelings, eh?
STEVE
Johnny, I'm sure you'll have plenty more "hard" feelings. And plenty more "mistakes."
JOHN
Yeah, well. Catch ya later.
STEVE
See you, mate. [JOHN goes.]
HUTTON
I tried to help Steve. I was braver than I thought I was going to be. Too brave. I blew ... just got so ... angry. I tried to make it hypothetical. I read old Pubic a newspaper clipping I've carried with me for years. [The set has changed to AYRES's office. Desk. Two chairs. AYRES is seated. On the other half of the stage STEVE sits in an armchair in darkness. Lights up on whole office.]
HUTTON
"Dear Barbara, There is a problem that is making my life such hell that I am thinking of killing myself, although I am only sixteen. I am homosexual. I am going out with a girl who has no suspicions. We have been having sex for a year now, but she can't turn me on the way the boys at school do."
MR
Simon, please—
HUTTON
"I really want to grow up and have children, but I desperately want sex with a man. If I do, I know that being a homosexual will ruin my life."
MR
Maybe it will.
HUTTON
And what does Aunty Barbara say to this poor, lonely, frightened child? "This obsession you have with homosexuality is fairly common amongst young people. Fortunately, it usually goes away. You are certainly in a turmoil and need help to understand yourself. If you telephone the Samaritans, they may be able to help. Their number is in the phone book. I don't think you are a true homosexual, or you wouldn't have such a good, loving relationship with your girl."
MR
Sound advice.
HUTTON
From a tabloid! Mr. Ayres, all this boy needed, wanted, was for anyone to tell him that it needn't ruin his life. Now maybe he's just one of the 20 percent of gay men who admit to attempting suicide in their teenage years. Now I tell you there's a similar boy here.
MR
Enough. I refuse to listen.
HUTTON
That's the fucking problem.
MR
Simon. Please, I am trying to help. But my position is difficult. I'm as angry as you about the bullying, but if you won't tell me the names of the boys involved, even the victim, there is nothing I can do. As for this other issue, the boy may indeed be going through a phase most people come out of.
HUTTON
Not everyone.
MR
Then it's up to people in our position to encourage them to see the value of resisting temptation. To offer support.
HUTTON
But it's such a frightening thing that none of the homosexuals here would dare talk about it. They're not all as brave as Carter.
MR
You make it sound as though we have an epidemic.
HUTTON
It's not a disease. Listen, even if you take the most conservative estimate—
MR
No more statistics, please!
HUTTON
—in a school this size there must be fifty boys with homosexual potential.
MR
That's a distressingly inappropriate word. And you suggest we should encourage them to achieve this "potential."
HUTTON
I'm suggesting we should do anything to ensure they achieve their potential as loving people. To feel they belong. So they don't grow up bitter and confused. We have to help. It's why we're here.
MR
Is it, Simon? I used to believe that once. But now we're here to market the school. My job is about damage limitation.
HUTTON
What about the damage to this boy?
MR
Simon, I'm answerable to the government. And I'm scared to upset ANYONE. I'm answerable to the law.
HUTTON
But there are good laws and bad. The age-of-consent law—
MR
Is there to protect young people.
HUTTON
From what? Doesn't anyone realise that it does anything but protect them? It actually removes any possible safety net. Supposing, just supposing, there were parents who would accept that their son of sixteen was gay. How can they support and encourage when the law says that that child is a criminal? So where do they go, these criminals?
MR
Now I can't talk about this anymore.
HUTTON
Oh, so now it's against the law to talk about it, is it?
MR
Since you mention it, Simon, for five years it has been illegal for a local authority to promote a positive image of homosexuality.
HUTTON
Jesus!
MR
If the boy wants help, he must talk to his parents. I'll ring them. Carter, you said.
HUTTON
Oh Jesus. Look, Mr. Ayres, at least let me talk to Steven.
MR
Mr. Hutton, the matter is out of your hands. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. However, I must say I find your obvious obsession with ... this subject ... very alarming. If you value your position at this school, please note that I positively forbid you to talk to Carter about it. And Simon, I have the law on my side.
HUTTON
Steven, what have I done?
STEVE
Dad, it's not your fault.
DAD
No? Then whose fault is it?
STEVE
Nobody's. Fault, blame, guilt ... it's nothing to do with any of that. It just is.
DAD
What a time for this to happen. I've just lost my mother and now...
STEVE
I'm still here, Dad.
DAD
This is my life you're destroying. Your mother's life.
STEVE
And what about my fucking life?
DAD
How dare you use that word to me.
STEVE
Dad. It's only a word. Fuck, gay, straight ... they're only words.
DAD
You think you're so clever. An answer for everything.
STEVE
I thought you were proud of me.
DAD
Proud? Of ... Christ, the thought of you in bed with another man makes me feel physically sick.
STEVE
Do you ever imagine me doing it with Linda? That was alright, was it? Reassuring to know your son was a real man. That make you feel okay? Bring a smile to your face, did it? [DAD goes to hit him.] GO ON! Hit me. You won't be the first, and you won't be the last. Why? WHY? What are you all so scared of? [DAD sits and cries.] Dad. Dad, please. I'm sorry you're hurt. And I'm sorry Mum's ... but I'm not sorry that I'm ...
DAD
You selfish sod. Can't you think about the rest of us? What about Linda? She'll be devastated.
STEVE
I doubt it. She's known for months.
DAD
Why tell Linda?
STEVE
I had to tell someone.
DAD
You could have come to ... [Breaks down again,]
STEVE
[Thinks about holding him but can't] Dad. Cry. It helps.
DAD
Your mother'll be in soon. She's never seen me like this.
STEVE
She's never seen you cry. My God!
DAD
Listen. It's not too late to spare your mother's feelings. I've tried to tell her that there must be some mistake. That you're confused. I sat here waiting for you to come home, wanting, praying that you would say, "Dad, it's not true." Why didn't you, Steven? Why couldn't you have lied?
STEVE
Because I've been brought up by you. And Mum. The two people who I love more than anyone in the world. Because I want them to love me, the real me and not someone I pretend to be to keep their love. Because I'm sick of lying. [Front door slams.]
DAD
Well, for your mother's sake, lie. Tell her you've thought it through and you were just confused.
STEVE
That word again.
DAD
What's wrong with you? Can't you do even that much to help?
MUM
[Entering] I'm sure it's going to rain. I got back just in time.
DAD
He said it might rain. Michael Fish. [Pause]
MUM
I'd better fix supper.
DADDAD 
[Together] I'm not hungry.
MUM
Tea then.
DAD
I'll do it. [Kisses her] Steven's got something to say to you. [Exit]
STEVE
Mum, I... I just... Oh, Mum! [He breaks down in his mother's arms.]
MUM
Oh, baby. My baby.
STEVE
Mum, the last thing I wanted was ... and I'm so sorry if ... Dad wants me to tell you that I'm ... and I AM! Now I AM CONFUSED. Please ... please don't reject me.
MUM
Steven, we love you.
STEVE
But Dad's so ... angry.
MUM
He's confused, too. Listen, love. When your father was a young boy, he used to be an altar server at Mass. Well, there was this man who was sort of head altar server. He was a friend of the family and invited your dad round for tea. I can't remember what he said to your dad's parents, but they trusted him.... Well, he was an altar server. They were wrong to trust him. Because he ... tried to ... and your Dad managed to run away. But he was so scared that he didn't go home for hours. And when he did, he got a terrible hiding for worrying his parents.
STEVE
He should have explained.
MUM
He was ashamed. He thought it was his fault.
STEVE
It wasn't. And now, well, this guy, he must have tried it with others since.
MUM
I don't think so. He became a priest. But you see, since then your dad has had a hatred for people like that.
STEVE
I'm not like that. I'm ...
MUM
Steven. Son. I know things seem bad now, but give yourself a chance. Things may change. Mr. Ayres suggested you go to the new sixth form college after summer. It's lovely there. They don't wear uniforms, it's more relaxed, and it's . . . well, mixed. Maybe being at an all-boys school ... I mean, you don't know many girls. Things will sort themselves out.
STEVE
My God. My God. Why is no one hearing me?
HUTTON
Hallo. Who? Steven ... Sorry, Steve, I can hardly hear you. Where are you? [Pause] Which pub? Have you been drinking? [Pause] Oh, Steven, you fool. You're underage. Now just go home and ... What? Er ... no, you can't come here. [Pause] Because ... well, it just wouldn't be right. [Pause] Speak up.... Of course I'm listening. [Pause] Yes, yes, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to give him your name. [Pause] How did they take it? [Pause] Give it time, Steven. He'll come round. Now just go home. [Pause] Well, if you don't belong there, where do you belong? [For the remainder of the speech it is important he moves and speaks identically to his first speech of the play.] Move away from the juke box. Steve. Steven. Listen to me. You're not making sense. [Pause] What? Steven, I am listening; I'm just not hearing you. Move away from the juke box. I've told you I can't. My position is ... difficult. Go home and sleep on it. Things'll be better in the morning. They always are. Believe me, Steven. No, don't do that. Steven! Steve! [STEVEN has hung up. Slowly HUTTON replaces the receiver and takes a swift swig from his whisky glass.] Believe me, my position is difficult. So what about your position? What are you going to do, Steven? What are you going to do now?
STEVE
Dad. Dad. Mum. Please don't reject me.
HUTTON
Well, if you don't belong there—
STEVE
I'm still your son.
DAD
The thought of you in bed with another man—
LINDA
Yuk!
MUM
Big boys don't hold hands.
STEVE
I know you think it—
DAD
Makes me feel—
GLEN
Filthy habit.
DAD
Physically sick.
STEVE
I'm sorry. Please, listen to me. Somebody,
HUTTON
No. You can't come here.
STEVE
I'm so fucking lonely.
LINDA
Would you like a child?
MUM
Only child.
STEVE
I want to die.
LINDA
Stop feeling so sorry for yourself.
JOHN
Help me. Please, help me.
HUTTON
But my position is difficult.
STEVE
Now I'm confused.
GLEN
How old are you?
MAN 
Innocent little boy.
MR
Straighten up, lad; straighten up.
MUM
You're confused.
STEVE
What on earth makes you think I'm—
LINDA
Don't tell me you're looking for love.
MAN 
Sex sex sex.
HUTTON
Fuck the sex—
MAN 
Do you like to suck?
HUTTON
Live the romance.
LINDA
It's a different bloke every time you call me.
HUTTON
Live—
STEVE
I want to die.
HUTTON
—the love.
JOHN
You can't make love to a bloke.
STEVE
It's fun.
JOHN
It's true, then ... that you're—
BOY 
Queer bastard.
JOHN
Dodgy.
MR
Misguided.
DAD
Sick.
LINDA
Confused.
MR
Unnatural.
STEVE
What are you all so scared of?
HUTTON
There are millions—
STEVE
Everyone my own age is straight.
DAD
He's a gay.
JOHN
I'm not gay.
MR
As you go through life—
STEVE
What about my fucking life? [He holds up a bottle of pills.] I love you, Johnny.
JOHN
Queer bastard.
STEVE
I won't tell anyone.
JOHN
Yes. Do it. Do it. [STEVE unscrews pills.]
STEVE
I'm so—
JOHN
—scared. So—
STEVE
Fucking.
JOHN
Scared.
STEVE
Angry.
JOHN
I love sex with girls.
LINDA
It could be a phase.
STEVE
Leave me alone.
JOHN
Give me a chance.
STEVE
I love—
JOHN
I don't think I'd like to do it—
STEVE
But you said.
JOHN
Terrible mistake.
STEVE
But—
JOHN
All that romantic crap.
STEVE
Sounds wonderful.
HUTTON
Exciting—
JOHN
Dirty.
HUTTON
Naughty.
JOHN
I couldn't get used to the lying.
STEVE
What do you want?
JOHN
I don't want to want to.
STEVE
I love you.
MUM
We love you.
JOHN
I'm not your lover.
KEVIN
Whoever said—
STEVE
You're beautiful.
DAD
You smell like a bloody poof.
JOHN
Do it. Please do it.
STEVE
Touch—
JOHN
Do it.
STEVE
Talk—
JOHN
Do it.
STEVE
Hold each other.
JOHN
Do it—
STEVE
What do you want?
JOHN
Don't leave me!
HUTTON
What are you going to do now? [STEVE rushes upstage.]
MR
[The light is now at the front of the stage. He comes into it so only AYRES, JOHN, and HUTTON are strongly lit. The others face upstage.] Apparently he got hold of his mother's painkillers and took the lot. Why would he do that?
JOHN
Makes you do a lot of things you don't want to do.
MR
Poor boy.
KEVIN
Whoever said Steven Carter was a boy?
JOHN
Peer pressure.
HUTTON
Why—
KEVIN
Did God make poofs?
HUTTON
Why didn't I let you come and see me?
DAD
Steven. Steve.
HUTTON
Because it's against the law. Oh, Steve—
MUM
Oh,baby—
DAD
Open your eyes, Steve. Please, God—
JOHN
Oh my God.
HUTTON
I just thought I'd tell you personally before—
MR
I'll announce it at assembly.
HUTTON
I mean, you and Carter seemed to be ...
JOHN
Lovers. Yes, we were.
KEVIN
Fuck me, Johnny. Poor bastard. He must have been so fucked up. Probably better off dead.
JOHN
No! He was ... beautiful. You were beautiful, Steven.
MR
I'll send the parents some flowers.
KEVIN
Jesus, I know we used to take the piss and that, but it was only a bit of ... Jesus!
LINDA
Steve. Babe. How can you be ... you were the most ...
JOHN
Beautiful.
LINDA
Alive person I ever—
DAD
Steven, of course I'm proud of ... was proud.
HUTTON
Where do they go, these criminal lovers, these criminal children?
MUM
Come back to us and we'll tell you that.
HUTTON
Into the toilets. Into the woods.
MUM
It doesn't matter what you are. I—
LINDA
I love you.
JOHN
I love you. I love you. I love you.
MR
Gentlemen, it is my sad duty to inform you that one of our number has been taken from us.
HUTTON
Oh, Steve. Bravery like yours was the way forward. You were a fighter.
MR
Steven Carter took his own life. One can only assume that the pressure of examinations affected him rather badly.
HUTTON
You just wanted them to see that we—
MR
This merely emphasises what I have always said.
HUTTON
We are your brothers.
MR
Whenever you feel the need to talk about a problem, you can always turn to the staff here.
HUTTON
Your fathers, for Christ's sake—
JOHN
For Christ's sake.
HUTTON
We are your children. And those of us who do make it, who take the risks, who get beaten and murdered in so called motiveless attacks, we huddle together in a self-perpetuating ghetto and turn the music up. Why not fight back?
JOHN
You're already so bitter.
HUTTON
Fight back.
LINDA
I don't want you to get all—
HUTTON
Bitter. Why—
LINDA
Twisted.
DAD
What's wrong with you?
HUTTON
Fight back.
JOHN
What's wrong with me?
LINDA
What's wrong—
HUTTON
Why always bitter?
JOHN
What's wrong—
LINDA
What's wrong—
DAD
What's wrong—
HUTTON
What's wrong with—
STEVEN
[He suddenly bursts forward, and the other characters scatter offstage.] NO! [Blackout. Single light on STEVE. He is breathing heavily. Shakes pill bottle and sees that it is still full] Dear Mum and Dad. Dear ... Everyone. I'm sorry, but I just can't take anymore. It seems that, hard as I try to love in my own way, you are all determined I should be sad and guilty. There would seem to be only one way out of this situation, [He examines the pill bottle.] I have decided ... to live ... my life as I want to, no matter what it takes. Will just one of you help me? Tell me I'm alright. Not confused. Not going through a phase. Not the only one. Not ill. Not a criminal. Will you? WILL YOU?
STEVE
You've only known him six weeks.
LINDA
I know. But he's special.
STEVE
Because he fucked you.
LINDA
No. And anyway, he hasn't... we've only kissed seven times. I can't believe how lucky I am.
STEVE
Because he's got a Mercedes?
LINDA
No. Because he's kind, intelligent, beautiful. And he's got a Mercedes.
STEVE
You're beautiful.
LINDA
Don't start.
STEVE
What?
LINDA
All that inner beauty crap. What good is inner beauty?
STEVE
You're very pretty, Lins.
LINDA
I've lost half a stone, you know. Only another couple and I'll be normal.
STEVE
Linda! I thought you were happy the way you were. Out and stout.
LINDA
People change.
STEVE
If they want to—
LINDA
Well, I—
STEVE
Or other people want them to. [Notices a man outside the toilet] I don't believe it. [Goes over to man]
LINDA
What. Oh, Steve, please. Your parents will...
STEVE
Hi. Remember me?
GLEN
What. Oh, sure. Hi.
STEVE
How's things?
GLEN
Okay. You?
STEVE
Oh. Settling down. My parents found out.
GLEN
[Panicked] About what?
STEVE
Me being gay.
GLEN
How did they take it?
STEVE
I'm seeing a therapist.
GLEN
Really? Look, it's nice to see you, but... can you go away?
STEVE
Listen, I really enjoyed it with you.
GLEN
Please just go.
STEVE
And I forgive you for not turning up last time—
GLEN
Look, I'll give you money, anything, just piss off!
KAREN
[Coming out of the Ladies] God, there's always a queue in these places. You blokes don't know how lucky you are. Oh, sorry.
GLEN
Oh, yeah. This is ... sorry I've forgotten—
STEVE
Steve.
GLEN
Oh, yeah. Steve. Steve, this is Karen. My wife.
STEVE
Pleased to meet you.
KAREN
Likewise. [Pause]
GLEN
Er... Steven came to see me in ... a show once. We got chatting after.
KAREN
Oh, really? Which one?
STEVE
Er ...
GLEN
It was that experimental rubbish.
KAREN
It wasn't rubbish. Well, you weren't anyway. Good, wasn't he, Steve?
STEVE
It was one of the most enjoyable performances I've ever experienced.
KAREN
Steady on. You'll make his head swell.
STEVE
Probably. Yes. It was so energetic, so penetrating, so ... truthful.
KAREN
I think you have a fan.
STEVE
Yes, Karen, I think your husband is one of the best actors I've ever ... come ... across.
GLEN
We'd better be off. See you.
KAREN
Bye.
STEVE
Bye. Good luck. [To KAREN] You'll need it.
LINDA
Who was that?
STEVE
Glen. Remember Glen?
LINDA
Sort of.
STEVE
His eyes.
LINDA
Oh, yeah. Tom Cruise.
STEVE
No. Not that. Fear. Blind terror. The same as Johnny's eyes before he hit... why am I frightening?
LINDA
You don't scare me.
STEVE
Glen offered me money. No one's ever offered me money to go away before.
LINDA
You must be losing your looks. [Pause] You alright, babe?
STEVE
What? Oh. Yeah.
LINDA
How's your shrink?
STEVE
He's not a shrink. He's a therapist.
LINDA
Whatever. What's he like?
STEVE
He's ... absolutely fucking gorgeous. [They laugh.] Fancy coming home? We could watch a vid.
LINDA
Sorry, babe. I'm meeting Rikki.
STEVE
Oh.
LINDA
Some other time.
STEVE
Sure.
LINDA
See you soon. Love ya.
STEVE
Me, too. [Exit LINDA. The lights change. The forestage is lit, as is the toilet. HUTTON downstage.]
HUTTON
It'll be hard, Steven. No matter how brave you are. I thought I was brave. Live and learn. [As he does this speech, music. Suggested track
STEVE
What are you all so frightened of?
HUTTON
On the other hand ... turn the music up. [STEVE dances defiantly and aggressively with two beautiful gay men while all the other characters shuffle from foot to foot in a ritual of mediocrity. Towards the end of the music all leave except JOHN and STEVE. JOHN walks slowly towards STEVE, who is still dancing unaware of him, nearly joins STEVE but exits. As the music climaxes, STEVE stands alone, defiant. Arms in the air. Freeze. All lights down except a single spot on the sign saying, "Gentlemen." Fade to black.]
SAM
[Addresses imaginary audience around him and County Council facing him] My name is Sam Chambers. I teach at Emory and live in this town with my partner, Dr. Richard Martinez, and my son, Taylor. I should be angry at what is happening here tonight. But I'm only sad. You think that we—my family is bringing something alien and evil into your community. We saw a house that we loved, that we wanted to fix up and make our home. Like many of you, we commute to the city, work long hours, and want to come home to someplace nice. We raise a kid and send him to a school we're happy he's in. We lead the same kind of ordinary, some would say dull, lives you do. Quiet nights, work on the house on weekends. You say you don't want people like us in your community. You don't know us!
HUNTER
[Rises] I'm Hunter Tucker. As you know, I've lived here most of my life. As editor of the Ledger, I know most of you and most of what happens in this community. And I know we're better than we are looking tonight. As a reporter, I'm trained not to speak without solid evidence. We're all judging people before any offense has been committed. Sam, I'm going to take you up on your invitation. Furthermore, I invite you and your family to spend an evening in our home. I'm sure more joins us than separates us.
RICK
A real Frank Capra moment. The newspaper editor and my lover doing their liberal schtick. I would have preferred a grenade myself. But then Sam and I are the gay version of CNN Crossfire.
SAM
It's not that simple.
RICK
That's Sam's favorite phrase. Find the complexity. He's an English professor. Find the niceness in people. He's a liberal. He should have lived with Hunter, and I belong with Hunter's wife—the one mentally shooting daggers at her husband.
SAM
Then you'd have to deal with her father. [To audience] That's him at the table running the show.
RICK
Like father, like daughter. She wants us in her house about as much as I want her in ours.
SAM
Believe me, this is the only way we can make progress.
RICK
Bullshit!
SAM
You're right. Crossfire.
RICK
[To audience] I'm a doctor. I spend my days prolonging the lives of people who have a disease I can't cure. I can't cure families either.
SAM
There's nothing wrong with our family.
RICK
The good folks around here don't agree with you.
SAM
[To audience] Here is Cobb County, Georgia.
RICK
The conservative side of the Atlanta suburbs. Atlanta is as gay a city as you'll ever see. Rainbow flags proudly flying in all the best neighborhoods. On the east are suburbs with more gays. On the west are crosses and what's left of the Ku Klux Klan. So we, of course, moved west.
SAM
We weren't the only ones.
RICK
No. We saw a great old house.
SAM
Not one of those Atlanta bungalows, but a real old Southern Gothic house. Right out of Faulkner.
RICK
Unfortunately, so were the neighbors.
SAM
So that's where we are. And this meeting? Well, a local theater put on a play suggesting that gay people weren't so bad and that straight people might learn to like us.
RICK
The righteous folk went into a feeding frenzy. Banned funding for the arts and tonight are having this meeting to vote on a resolution condemning the "gay lifestyle."
SAM
I've always forbidden my students to use the word lifestyle.
RICK
There are worse words than lifestyle, darlin'. Anyway, surprise, surprise!! The resolution passed.
BAILEY
[Stands] I am pleased to announce that the County Council has passed
SAM
It's just a resolution, not law.
RICK
Right! Hasn't the last fight made you a bit more cynical?
SAM
[To audience] We just fought for custody of my son.
TAYLOR
Hi.
SAM
After Taylor's mother and I separated—
RICK
Sam loved the closet.
SAM
No, I didn't. Or I would have stayed married.
RICK
Married right after college. Stayed married till he was thirty.
SAM
So?
RICK
Sam was the only English professor in the p.c. eighties to think homosexuality was unfashionable.
TAYLOR
Come on, guys.
SAM
I'm sorry to say he's right. But I came around and came out. And we've been together for seven years. My ex-wife died last spring in a car crash. Awful California drivers. Her parents fought like hell to keep Taylor.
RICK
The lawyers really played dirty.
SAM
Too dirty. They lost, thank God. And whatever they say, we're a family.
RICK
This story is about the making and unmaking and collision of families— families into which you're born and families you make yourself. It's about us and the Tuckers—those folks at the meeting? Well, as you'll see, we made visits to each other's houses, but not quite the way Sam and Hunter envisioned.
SAM
The big variable in all this is our sons. Our Taylor and Hunter and Marian's son, Tom. Seventeen and not controllable quantities in any social experiment. While Hunter and Marian and Rick and I were at the meeting, Taylor was over at their house with their son.
TAYLOR
I give up. You're too good.
TOM
I play all the time. By myself.
TAYLOR
That's not much fun.
TOM
It's okay.
TAYLOR
Don't you know anybody at school?
TOM
Everybody. But they don't want to know me.
TAYLOR
I thought you were new here.
TOM
We've lived here forever. I went to a private school. I had to leave.
TAYLOR
Oh.
TOM
Don't you want to know why? Everybody around here does.
TAYLOR
It's up to you.
TOM
You didn't do it.
TAYLOR
I know, but. Shit, I don't know what to say.
TOM
My best friend shot himself. Last summer. So ...
TAYLOR
I'm glad you didn't succeed.
TOM
Are you?
TAYLOR
Yeah. I need a friend around here.
TOM
So do I.
TAYLOR
I'm treated like a fucking leper. And it's going to be worse after tonight.
TOM
Why?
TAYLOR
Don't you know what's going on?
TOM
You mean about the homosexuals moving in?
TAYLOR
The homosexuals? That's my father and his partner.
TOM
No. Really.
TAYLORTAYLOR
The meeting must be over. I'd better get home.
TOM
Taylor, are we friends?
TAYLOR
I said so, didn't I?
TOM
We've got to be.
BAILEY
That was the most damn fool thing I ever saw you do. What got into you?
MARIAN
i'll make some decaf.
BAILEY
Decaf, hell. I need a stiff drink.
HUNTER
I could use one myself.
BAILEY
Really? I thought you must have had a few already.
HUNTER
I don't think talking about this is going to do any good.
BAILEY
God knows you put your foot in it already.
MARIAN
We've got to talk about it. You've got us in a real mess. How are we going to get out of this?
HUNTER
I don't plan to get out of anything.
BAILEY
This town is about to blow to pieces, and we can't afford to take the wrong side.
HUNTER
I'm trying to bring people together.
BAILEY
Not those people.
HUNTER
They seem perfectly decent folks to me.
BAILEY
I don't call sexual perversion decent. They don't even have the decency to keep quiet about it. I'd keep your fondness for those queers to yourself.
MARIAN
Please. I'm not in the mood to move.
HUNTER
No one's going to have to move.
TOM
I want you to meet my friend, Taylor. This is my mom and dad and my granddad. [Handshakes, etc.] Taylor just moved down the street.
MARIAN
Oh yes? Which house?
TAYLOR
It's not actually down the street. We're over on Wisteria.
TOM
Randy's house.
HUNTER
We just met your father at the town meeting.
TAYLOR
Oh yeah? What happened?
HUNTER
I'm sure your father will tell you.
TAYLOR
Bad news, huh?
BAILEY
Most people don't think so.
TAYLOR
I'd better be going. It's past my curfew. Nice to meet all of you.
HUNTER
Nice to meet you, Taylor.
TOM
See you tomorrow?
TAYLOR
Sure.
BAILEY
That's all we need.
HUNTER
He seems like a nice kid.
MARIAN
You think everyone is nice.
HUNTER
Maybe. I try to.
BAILEY
[To MARIAN] You'd better nip this in the bud.
HUNTER
Nip what?
MARIAN
Let me handle this.
HUNTER
He's our son. Yours and mine. Not yours and Bailey's.
BAILEY
We know.
HUNTER
What's that supposed to mean?
MARIAN
From now on, no visitors without my permission.
HUNTER
Marian, this is the first visitor in ...
MARIAN
What do you know about this boy?
TOM
He lived in California with his mother. She died. He just moved here to live with his father.
MARIAN
That's all?
TOM
What's the ...
MARIAN
[Before he can finish] ... You cannot be friendly with that boy.
HUNTER
I see no reason why they shouldn't....
BAILEY
I sure as hell do.
HUNTER
KEEP OUT OF THIS! Tom will find out what he needs to know about his friend in good time.
BAILEY
Son, were you listening at all tonight?
HUNTER
I didn't feel very good about what I heard tonight. And I don't feel too good about what I'm hearing in here.
BAILEY
You're opening one hell of a can of worms, Hunter. And there may be no one around you can call a friend.
HUNTER
If that happens, I reckon you'll have something to do with it.
BAILEY
I certainly won't protect you. We're businessmen, remember. And we're dependent on the goodwill of the people around here if we're going to keep in business.
HUNTER
We run a newspaper. That's not just a business.
BAILEY
Don't preach to me about the high calling of journalism. Nobody has to read a newspaper anymore. We reflect the values out here, or we're out of business.
HUNTER
Values?
MARIAN
Dad is right and you know it.
BAILEY
You're getting yourself into a no-win situation. Sleep on it. You can still get out of this gracefully.
MARIAN
I'll see Dad out. You had better have a talk with your son.
TOM
I'm right here, Mom. Don't talk as if I'm not here.
MARIAN
[Laced with irony] I know you're here, Tom.
BAILEY
Tom, son, would you go up to your room for just a minute or two?
TOM
Gladly, sir. [He exits.]
BAILEY
That resolution tonight is serious business. A lot of important people are behind it.
HUNTER
And some aren't.
BAILEY
The point is, I'm behind it, and I don't care about those who aren't.
HUNTER
I see.
BAILEY
Marian and I don't want any more trouble with that house on Wisteria.
HUNTER
What do you two have to do with that house?
BAILEY
If I find out he's with that boy, I'll have him out of here and into military school before he knows what hit him.
HUNTER
I think I have some say in that. I'm his father.
BAILEY
Then act like it, for God Almighty's sake! Lay down the law!
HUNTER
Whose law? Yours?
BAILEY
I'm going home.
MARIAN
I'll see you to your car.
HUNTER
[Calls] Tom!
TOM
What happened? What's wrong with Taylor?
HUNTER
Your friend's visit couldn't have been timed worse.
TOM
Why are they always mad at you?
HUNTER
Let's talk about Taylor now. Okay?
TOM
Sure.
HUNTER
I want to handle this, Marian.
MARIAN
And I want to hear how you handle it.
HUNTER
Fine.
TOM
What did Taylor do?
HUNTER
He didn't do anything. Look, Taylor lives with his father and his fa-ther's—friend—
MARIAN
Lover. Male lover. They're homosexuals.
TOM
I know.
MARIAN
You know. And do you know about Taylor?
TOM
What?
MARIAN
What! That he's homosexual, too?
TOM
He didn't say that.
HUNTER
There's no reason to assume that.
MARIAN
I'd bet on it.
HUNTER
LET ME HANDLE THIS! Sam, Taylor's father I'm sure is a decent man who is trying to raise his son decently. But there are a lot of people who don't want people like Taylor's father and his friend living out here.
TOM
That's crazy!
HUNTER
His father's friend is a doctor who treats AIDS patients. That scares people, too.
TOM
So what?
MARIAN
So we'd rather you not be too close to Taylor.
TOM
He's my friend!
MARIAN
I don't want that boy in this house. And you are forbidden to go to that house.
TOM
This isn't going to happen again!! I belong there!!!
HUNTER
What the hell did that mean?
MARIAN
I'd like to burn that house to the ground.
HUNTER
That's a bit extreme.
MARIAN
Is it? First Randy's death. Then Tom breaks down and tries to kill himself.
HUNTER
Shock and grief.
MARIAN
You know as well as I that people didn't think it was normal.
HUNTER
Your father didn't think it was normal.
MARIAN
Now we have that gay couple and their boy in that house. All Tom needs is to latch onto that boy and be seen all over with him.
HUNTER
Are you worried about Tom or what people will say?
MARIAN
You know the two are connected. Randy's parents were smart to leave.
HUNTER
Probably in disgust, given the monumental lack of compassion they received.
MARIAN
It wasn't something people here wanted to deal with.
HUNTER
People! Who the hell are these almighty people? I wish you'd worry less about people and more about what's right for us.
MARIAN
Like inviting those men to dinner?
HUNTER
It won't kill us.
MARIAN
If they stay, more will come.
HUNTER
You sound like old Lester Maddox trying to keep blacks from eating his fried chicken. Seeing old Lester out at the meeting tonight was the perfect touch.
MARIAN
Old Lester became governor after that.
HUNTER
Let's hope times have changed.
MARIAN
Not that much.
HUNTER
They seem like nice men. I don't want anything bad to happen to them,
MARIAN
They're asking for it.
HUNTER
Hello. Yes, Dale.... Well, I'm just trying to keep an open mind.... The paper has taken no stand on the issue.... I take it that's an ultimatum.... Well, I'll take that under advisement.... You've been good loyal clients, Dale.... I'll let you know.... Good night.
MARIAN
Really. Tom's gone again.
RICK
Just for the record, it's you I'm pissed at. Their venom was to be expected. But to suck up to those redneck bastards!
SAM
I just want to see if we can live here in peace.
RICK
Maybe you and that Tucker character can move in together.
SAM
Where were you tonight?
TAYLOR
Up the street. Tom Tucker's.
RICK
Son of the Tuckers?
TAYLOR
I guess. What happened at the meeting?
RICK
Didn't the Tuckers tell you?
TAYLOR
They told me to ask my father. So what happened?
SAMSAM
Our kind are officially unwelcome in this county.
RICK
The County Council has given everyone a hunting license. Beat up faggots. Burn down dykes' houses.
TAYLOR
Great. Did anybody fight back?
SAM
Oh yeah, a few brave souls. A lesbian couple spoke up. One guy. They said they had lived here for years and were hurt at the welcome mat being pulled out from under them.
RICK
Hurt? They should be outraged. Spit in their fucking faces. What the hell are we doing here?
TAYLOR
Rick's got a point. What the hell are we doing here?
SAM
We liked the house, remember? And we're sending you to the best public high school in the area.
TAYLOR
So this is for me! Great!! So I can go to a school where I'm treated like a leper.
SAM
You didn't tell me there was trouble at school.
TAYLOR
You didn't ask. I haven't been attacked—yet—but they make it clear I'm not welcome.
RICK
Shit! Nothing changes!
TAYLOR
Did you go through this?
RICK
Oh yeah! People get real excited about cultural purification. And they pass their hatred on to their kids.
TAYLOR
What am I supposed to do?
SAM
We'll see about getting you into a private school.
RICK
Or we move.
TAYLOR
Maybe I should go back to California.
SAM
Back to your grandparents?
TAYLOR
I had a life there.
RICK
The joys of suburban living.
SAM
You wanted this, too.
RICK
I had misgivings. I'm the only dark-skinned person out here who's not mowing people's lawns. That's a little bit unsettling. Then there's the matter of hating fags. But maybe if you invite them all to dinner, they'll come to love us.
SAM
Let's just drop that.
TAYLOR
What's this dinner thing?
RICK
Oh, this is the best part. Old Sam invited anyone who wanted to see how normal we are to drop by. We'll have to put metal detectors by the front door.
SAM
I have to begin from the premise that these are decent people.
RICK
Who want to run you out of the county. Christ, inviting them over! They want to burn this place down, not visit it!
TAYLOR
Don't worry. No one will take you up 0n your invitation.
RICK
Your friend's father did.
TAYLOR
That's why she and her father were so pissed off!
RICK
Dish, child.
SAM
Can I get a beer first?
RICK
One for me, too.
TAYLOR
And me.
SAM
Forget it. [He goes to kitchen.]
RICK
[To TOM] Okay. The inside story on the Tucker household.
SAM
[Offstage] Talk loudly so I can hear.
TAYLOR
For a beer.
SAM
[Off]
TAYLOR
Tom is in my class. He called me up and asked me over. We studied math and played video games. He's a nice guy. Sad, though.
RICK
I'm not surprised. So there's one kid who's friendly.
TAYLOR
Yeah, but he doesn't have any friends either. He just stays in his room all the time. Like Rapunzel.
RICK
Don't go camp on us, Taylor. Your grandparents will repossess.
TAYLOR
His parents gave me the cold shoulder. His mother did. And his grandfather. His father's all right.
SAM
[Offstage] So. Details. What happened tonight?
TAYLOR
His parents and grandfather came home from the meeting. Mrs. Tucker looked like she was about to go ballistic. And the old man was harrumphing all over the place.
RICK
They were probably as pissed about her hubby's niceness as I was about my hubby's performance. It was like watching the death throes of liberalism.
SAM
[Returning with drinks] Then, to top it all off, they discover their son has been playing with the son of the house of sin.
TAYLOR
You got it!
SAM
You've earned your beer.
RICK
I'd love to have been a fly on the wall.
TAYLOR
There was a real family feud. Him against her and Daddy.
RICK
But Daddy owns the paper. Hubby only edits it. And I bet she's old family who married beneath her. Mr. Liberal will lose.
TAYLOR
Anyway, Tom and I walked in, and the temperature dropped to zero.
SAM
I'm sorry.
TAYLOR
Tom really needs a friend. So do I.
RICK
I have a feeling his mother won't be keen on you two being buddies.
TAYLOR
Yeah. I'm sure of that. Too bad. We're the two outcasts at school.
RICK
It is too bad.
TAYLOR
It gets worse.
SAM
Oh God!
TAYLOR
I shouldn't tell you this....
RICK
Dish, child!
TAYLOR
Tom tried to slash his wrists last year—after his best friend shot himself.
RICK
Jesus! It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out!
TAYLOR
What do you mean?
SAM
Yeah. What do you mean?
RICK
And you're trained to analyze stories? Later.
TAYLOR
Randy—the friend—lived here.
RICK
Oh shit! We are in for it.
SAM
Brick.
TAYLOR
That's a relief.
RICK
Let the games begin.
RICK
I'll turn on the outside lighting. What was it?
TAYLOR
[Has brought in brick from other room] A. brick. With a note. [He unwraps note and reads it.] "Get AIDS and die, faggots." People really say that? "Get AIDS and die!"
RICK
Oh yeah. All the time.
TAYLOR
It's so unbelievably cruel!
SAM
That hate! It doesn't scare me. It infuriates me. And the most infuriating thing is that it makes me hate. I don't want to feel like this.
RICK
It's a hell of a lot better than swallowing their bullshit and hating yourself.
TAYLOR
Can we please turn off the alarm?
SAM
Now what?
TAYLOR
I'm going out and take a look around.
RICK
Are you out of your fucking mind? Didn't you see Deliverance?
TAYLOR
No.
RICK
We all should have seen it before we decided to move here.
SAM
I'm worried about arms escalation. Today a brick, tomorrow a burning cross, Sunday guns.
RICK
I'm getting our gun.
SAM
You know I don't approve.
RICK
Tough! [He gets gun from kitchen. Returns.]
TAYLOR
Should we call the police?
RICK
You must be kidding!
TAYLOR
Yeah. Right. Maybe we ought to put up a for sale sign before they burn the place down.
RICK
Our version of the white flag? No fucking way! We stay!
SAM
Whoa! A minute ago you were screaming, "What am I doing here?"
RICK
That was before the brick. There are lots of reasons to leave this godforsaken place....
SAM
This is God's country, lover
RICK
But this is still America, isn't it? Land of the free? Home of the brave? Well, we're free to live here, and I hope we're brave enough to hold our ground.
SAM
You're sure on your soapbox tonight.
TAYLOR
Rick's right. We really shouldn't run from this.
SAM
Not so fast! Your mother was terrified that if she died and you had to live with us, you'd get beaten up, ostracized, by other kids. Your grandparents sued for custody to avoid that.
RICK
They also didn't want you living with fags.
SAM
There was that, too.
TAYLOR
I took self-defense in San Diego. I'll just have to get back in practice.
RICK
Quick.
TAYLOR
I know.
SAM
So we stay.
RICK
We stay. And no more pretending these are nice people who want to get along with us. This is war. Sam?
SAM
This goes against my nature....
RICK
Sam!
SAM
I will keep my mouth shut in public places.
RICK
Good boy. Batten down the hatches.
SAM
What do we do about the vigilantes?
RICK
You and I probably should sleep in shifts. One of us should stay downstairs and keep watch.
SAM
What are we going to do if they come back?
RICK
Sound the alarm. Make a shitload of noise. And keep the gun where we can get at it.
SAM
I'll take the first shift. [To TAYLOR] And you've got school. Don't try to sneak Letterman on either. Sleep.
TAYLOR
Spoil sport. Goodnight guys. [He kisses RICK and SAM. Exits.]
RICK
That's the first time he's done that.
SAM
Sometimes I think he's your son more than mine anyway.
RICK
Ours now.
SAM
I don't want the kid to have any more traumas. He's lived through a lot this year. His mother dying, the custody battle with her folks.
RICK
Taylor will be alright. But those other boys. Poor Randy. Sad, sad, sad.
TAYLOR
Somebody's outside.
RICK
I heard them,
SAM
Front or back?
TAYLOR
Back.
SAM
What if the bastard s armed?
RICK
Bullets would be coming through the window the way the brick did. They're out to scare us, not to kill us. So far.
TAYLOR
I heard only one guy.
RICK
[Grabs gun] You two stay here. I want to catch this asshole. It may be the one who threw the brick.
SAM
You're crazy.
SAM
He's going to get himself killed.
TAYLOR
Worry about the other guy.
TOM
Please. Put the gun down.
TAYLOR
[In unison with TOM] Put the gun down. It's Tom Tucker.
RICK
Of course.
TAYLOR
Tom, what were you doing out there?
TOM
I had to talk to you.
SAM
Don't you think introductions are in order?
TAYLOR
This is my father, Sam.
SAM
Glad to meet you ..,
RICK
... at this ungodly hour.
TOM
[To RICK] You're...
RICK
An alien, actually. Sam and Taylor are earthlings I hold in thrall.
TAYLOR
That's Rick Martinez, my father's partner.
RICK
Lover. Why are you here, Tom?
TOM
My mother said I couldn't see Taylor anymore.
RICK
Surprise, surprise!
TOM
They're going to make trouble.
TAYLOR
Who?
TOM
My mother. My grandfather.
RICK
We've figured that out. They've got help. We've already lost a window.
TOM
I'm on your side.
RICK
Against your family?
TOM
My father's okay.
SAM
Your father is outnumbered. So are we.
RICK
Why did you have to run over to tell us this tonight?
TOM
I had to be here. He lived here. Randy. I loved him.
SAM
[To RICK] That's what—???
RICK
Exactly.
TOM
Randy was my best friend since we were little kids. We started playing with each other, you know. Having sex. That summer it got serious. He was everything to me.
RICK
Did anybody know?
TOM
We didn't think so. We thought it was our secret.
RICK
And you were mistaken.
TOM
We used to go to this graveyard by an old church a couple of miles out of town.
TOM
I love it here.
RANDY
It's okay.
TOM
Just okay?
RANDY
It's sort of creepy.
TOM
But it's ours.
RANDY
We're the only ones who think so.
TOM
That's alright. Nothing of this belongs to anyone else. Us. Here. We own this.
RANDY
That's bullshit, Tommy. We own squat.
TOM
Summer's over. I wanted tonight to be special.
RANDY
I know. It's just that I can't keep up with you.
TOM
You like it as much as I do.
RANDY
I mean feelings. I just don't feel as much as you do.
TOM
That's okay. I love you, Randy. It's okay.
RANDY
No, it isn't. School starts tomorrow.
TOM
So what? Nothing has to change.
RANDY
Bullshit!
TOM
We can still get together on weekends.
RANDY
I don't know, Tommy.
TOM
Why not?
RANDY
My father says I've got to date more.
TOM
That's stupid. You don't have to.
RANDY
Yes, I do. You'd better, too.
TOM
Why?
RANDY
Why do you think? They're suspicious.
TOM
Your parents?
RANDY
My dad. Your mom, too. Did you see how she ignored me tonight?
TOM
She's that way with everybody. The Ice Goddess. She ignores me!
RANDY
I saw your granddad downtown today. I said hello. He turned and crossed the street. He used to take us fishing!
TOM
He was thinking about something else. You know how he is.
RANDY
They know, Tommy. I know they know. Will they tell my father? He'll kill me!
TOM
We've been careful.
RANDY
No, we haven't. We're on the phone every night.
TOM
Lots of guys are.
RANDY
Tommy, we don't have girlfriends. Everybody knows we haven't screwed anyone.
TOM
Yes, we havE.
RANDY
Listen, Tommy! We can't fuck up our lives. I want a decent life with a job and a homE.
TOM
And a wife and kidS?
RANDY
Maybe. That's what's expected if you're going to live around herE.
TOM
That's not a good reasoN.
RANDY
I know. I don't knoW,
TOM
You want to stoP?
RANDY
No, but...
TOM
Then what choice do we havE?
RANDY
None. It's just...
TOM
Maybe we should just go home noW.
RANDY
Tommy, come back in here. Please!
TOM
I love you, Randy. I can't give you up.
RANDY
I don't want to give you up either. But they're going to catch us, Tommy.
TOM
I don't give a shit anymore.
RANDY
Don't be stupid.
TOM
I don't.
RANDY
[Sits up quickly] Someone's coming.
TOM
Nobody ever comes out here.
RANDY
Somebody's coming now. I swear. Listen.
TOM
Shut up and they won't find us.
VOICE 
Get out of that bag, both of you.
RANDY
Daddy ...
FATHER
Now! I've got a gun.
RANDY
Daddy? How did you ...
FATHER
Shut up. Just get out of that bag.
TOM
What are you going to do?
FATHER
To you? Nothing. This never happened. None of this with you two ever happened. And don't you tell anyone otherwise.
TOM
Thank you.
FATHER
It's no favor to you. I don't want anyone knowing about this. Now get your clothes, and get the hell out of here.
TOM
[Putting on his clothes] What are you going to do? You can't hurt him.
FATHER
I said get out of here! Now!! And if you try to get in touch with this piece of shit, I will call your parents. Hell, I'll put an ad in their fucking newspaper. Then I'll come after you with this.
RANDY
How did you know we were here?
FATHER
Shut up, faggot. I'm going to teach you a lesson.
TAYLOR
Did Randy's father know you saw what happened?
TOM
I don't think so. They moved away right after Randy killed himself.
RICK
And your folks?
TOM
No one is supposed to talk about anything ugly around here. Randy killed himself. I lost my best friend. Period.
SAM
Holding all this in must have been awful.
TOM
I've spent a year feeling like I was going to puke. I dream of Randy's father's face behind that light. And the gun. And Randy's face.
TAYLOR
It's okay.
TOM
I had to get it out. It's my fault. He'd be alive if we hadn't...
RICK
How could you blame yourself? You didn't kill him. Blame his father. Don't blame yourself. Or Randy.
SAM
Taylor, take Tom into the kitchen and get him something to drink.
RICK
Fishy, though.
SAM
You don't believe him?
RICK
Sure. But how did Randy's father know where they were?
SAM
Now we've clicked over to Murder She Wrote.
RICK
The kid looks absolutely haunted.
SAM
If we decide to make a cause of this kid, we're really declaring war.
RICK
War has already been declared. A father raped and beat the shit out of his son for loving someone. A brick came through our window. You want everything to be nice, Sam. It isn't. It's not a nice world.
SAM
So what do you propose? That we sue the kid's parents for custody?
RICK
I'm not sure yet. But we've got to help him. People fall into your lap. Tom has fallen into ours. We have a responsibility.
SAM
To do what?
RICK
We let the kid know he's got friends. That's al!.
SAM
Around here that's called recruiting.
RICK
Who's side are you on?
SAM
I'm simply stating facts.
RICK
That's not a fact. It's a prejudice. We're not closeted priests fondling our charges. We're out, remember? And doing the honorable thing.
SAM
Sometimes your righteousness is truly nauseating.
RICK
Ditto to your wimpy pragmatism. You want to fold? Escape? Leave this kid to be a basket case?
SAM
I'm worried about Taylor.
RICK
I'll bet the ranch that Taylor will not want to fold on this.
SAM
It's not his fight.
RICK
Maybe it is his fight. Ever think of that?
SAM
What does that mean?
RICK
Maybe he's gay. Ever talk about it with him?
SAM
No. He just got here a couple of months ago.
RICK
Never? Never told him the facts of life? Never warned him about safe sex?
SAM
No. I guess I assumed his mother did.
RICK
You must be kidding! She didn't want to believe he had eyes for anyone but her.
SAM
That's...
RICK
Beside the point. Sorry. Talk to Taylor.
SAM
I just can't broach that subject yet.
RICK
Yet? He's almost seventeen.
SAM
I know. But...
RICK
Are you afraid the spirits of his grandparents and the ghost of his mother will steal him away? Afraid you'll corrupt him?
SAM
Yes, damn it! I am afraid of being blamed if...
RICK
You don't want him to be gay!
SAM
Would you?
RICK
I made my peace with that subject a long time ago. I thought you had, too.
SAM
I have.
RICK
Bullshit! This explains your need to have those shitheads approve of you.
SAM
I want their respect. Don't you?
RICK
I only want them to leave us alone. Jesus! You're still ashamed!
SAM
That's not true.
RICK
I've had enough of this discussion for one night. [He starts off. Stops.] One final word. It doesn't take tea leaves to see what's going to happen between Tom and Taylor.
SAM
What?
RICK
Tom needs to love someone. And be loved. We'll soon know if Taylor's— perish the thought!!—one of us. Goodnight, asshole! [He starts off again. Doorbell rings.] Gosh, I wonder who that might be? You answer. You're his pal.
SAM
What do we do about Tom?
RICK
We're not going to start hiding people in closets. We tell the truth.
SAM
You're such a fucking boy scout.
RICK
I'm the boy scout????
SAM
Now behave.
RICK
I promise not to fire the first shot.
SAM
Come in.
RICK
[To MARIAN] So you just couldn't wait to take us up on our invitation.
MARIAN
It's a bit late for irony. Is our son here?
SAM
He's in the kitchen with my son. I understand you met Taylor earlier.
HUNTER
Yes. We did.
MARIAN
I'm surprised you didn't send him right home. It's almost midnight on a school night.
RICK
He wasn't in any condition to go right home.
MARIAN
What does that mean?
SAM
He was rather upset. He was worried about Taylor's safety, I think.
MARIAN
We told him he was not to be friends with Taylor.
SAM
So we heard. May we ask why?
MARIAN
Do I really have to spell it out?
RICK
Yes.
MARIAN
I don't believe you're his father.
HUNTER
This isn't the time for a battle. We just came for our son.
SAM
Taylor is a good kid. He'd be a good friend for Tom.
MARIAN
I don't think so. I think he'd cause Tom to be ostracized.
RICK
From what I understand, Tom doesn't have any friends.
MARIAN
He'll never have any if he hangs around with your son.
SAM
Taylor has always been very popular.
MARIAN
He won't be here. People aren't going to let your son in their house. Or their children in yours.
RICK
I can imagine who will stir up "the people."
MARIAN
They're already stirred up.
SAM
We know. We just had a brick sail through the dining room window.
HUNTER
I'm sorry.
MARIAN
Maybe you'll take the hint.
RICK
I respect your honesty, Mrs. Tucker. I really do. Your values reek, but you don't beat around the bush.
SAM
Your son came here of his own free will tonight. He was distraught. We thought he should cool down a bit before he went home.
MARIAN
What did he tell you?
RICK
Ask him. I'll get him. [He exits to kitchen.]
SAM
Rick is very angry about what happened at the meeting.
HUNTER
I can understand that.
MARIAN
May I ask what you intend to do?
SAM
We intend to stay.
MARIAN
I see. Tom, we're going home. Now.
TOM
These people are my friends. I'm not going to turn my back on them because you want me to.
MARIAN
This isn't the place to discuss this.
RICK
What better place?
MARIAN
I can't imagine a worse place.
RICK
Not enough Ethan Allen?
MARIAN
I hate this house. I hate your being here. I hate your poisoning this town.
TOM
Maybe you'd like them all to do what Randy did!
MARIAN
Keep Randy out of this.
TOM
Randy and I loved each other.
MARIAN
We're going home. I am not having this discussion.
HUNTER
It is late
MARIAN
EVER!! I knew this house would poison everything.
SAM
Tom and Randy happened before we came on the scene.
MARIAN
So this has already been discussed tonight? Has it, Tom?
TOM
I told them. I had to tell someone.
RICK
Wait a minute! You knew about Tom and Randy?
MARIAN
Of course I knew.
TOM
Randy thought you and he knew. And you never said anything!
HUNTER
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit lost here.
MARIAN
As usual, you're a bit naive. Tom and Randy were having—what would you gentlemen say?—an affair?
HUNTER
Were you, Tom?
TOM
Yes. All that summer. It seemed natural.
MARIAN
Natural!
HUNTER
Oh my Lord. Why didn't I see it?
MARIAN
Because you didn't want to see it.
TOM
How did you know?
MARIAN
You changed so much.
TOM
I was happy!
HUNTER
Why wasn't I told?
MARIAN
And what would you have done? Been wonderfully warm and supportive? That was the last thing we wanted.
HUNTER
We? Of course. You told your father, but not me.
MARIAN
I knew he'd know what to do.
HUNTER
It's none of his business! But, of course, everything is his business. The paper, the county, our life.
MARIAN
This conversation is finished.
TOM
Why didn't you tell me?
MARIAN
What did you want me to tell you? That it was disgusting? That I get sick thinking about it? That I was mortified? That sometimes I think Randy did the right thing?
TOM
Then why didn't you give me a gun?
HUNTER
I'm going to my son. [He exits into kitchen.]
RICK
[To SAM] You might check on yours.
SAM
Yes. I'll be right back.
RICK
[After a silence] I'm going to have a brandy. Want some?
MARIAN
Yes. Please.
RICK
I see. If the faggots hadn't moved down the street into Randy's house, you could have pretended that nothing ever happened.
MARIAN
They were boys experimenting with something dangerous. Who could have known Randy was so mixed up?
RICK
What about Tom? He's been grief-stricken for a year?
MARIAN
He'll get over it.
RICK
And the suicide attempt?
MARIAN
That's none of your business.
RICK
It is now.
MARIAN
Questionable. And I refuse to be made the bitch in your woman-hating homosexual fantasy.
RICK
Lady, I don't hate women. I like them a lot. I just hate bigots.
MARIAN
I'm not a bigot. I believe in certain things—absolutes. There is right and wrong. I still believe that.
RICK
And Hunter.
MARIAN
Hunter thinks he lives in Mister Roger's neighborhood.
RICK
You and Hunter sound like me and Sam.
MARIAN
Don't try to equate your life with mine.
RICK
Too bad, darlin'. You might have had a friend.
MARIAN
Please. I'm tired.
RICK
I'm tired, too. And I'm not interested in your problem with gay people. I just don't want it to be our problem. Like you, I'm perfectly willing to be as much a monster as I need to be to protect my turf and my loved ones. And, lady, I can outbitch you any day. Because there is one big difference between us. I enjoy being a bitch!
MARIAN
Noted.
RICK
Good.
MARIAN
This is—was—Randy's house. Did Tom tell you that?
RICK
We—knew.
MARIAN
Well, your friend ...
RICK
Lover.
MARIAN
Lover. Got this house under false pretenses.
RICK
How's that?
MARIAN
He came with a woman friend to see it. Then with two women and you. Never just the two of you.
RICK
You think Sam and I should have come hand in hand?
MARIAN
You two had separate phone listings in Atlanta.
RICK
I didn't want calls from his students, and he didn't want calls from my patients. You thought we did that to put one over on the citizens of this fair town?
MARIAN
Some people assumed that.
RICK
How do you know all this?
MARIAN
My father is chairman of the bank that sold you the house. Where your mortgage is.
RICK
And somebody didn't do their homework.
MARIAN
That somebody is out of a job.
RICK
Daddy's merciless.
MARIAN
That's one way to look at it.
RICK
What's another?
MARIAN
My father holds the line.
RICK
One thing puzzles me about you people. You're crystal clear on what you're against, but I can never figure out what you're for.
MARIAN
What are you for?
RICK
My family. The people I love. I'll fight to the death for us. You can't make us ashamed of our life together.
MARIAN
A lot of people think you should be.
RICK
Sam's a fine man. I didn't trust anyone when I met him. I had been disowned by my parents, thrown out of my fraternity in college, and fallen in love with a few guys who hated themselves too much to love. Sam showed me that love is possible.
MARIAN
Obviously he didn't show that to his wife and son.
RICK
Leaving them was very hard for him. But he was gay and deserved a real marriage.
MARIAN
So he left his wife and child for you.
RICK
Yes. And I'm not about to be judged for that.
MARIAN
I didn't say a word.
RICK
You didn't have to. A look is worth a thousand words. Jesus! It never ceases to amaze me how you righteous people get your kicks being horrified.
MARIAN
Don't stereotype me.
RICK
Excuse me! What have you been doing to us? Sam and I are as committed a couple as there is in Cobb County. That's our choice. We both love Taylor. We don't have sex with him. We leave incest to you family values people. And Tom is safe from me. I'm not into teenage boys.
MARIAN
And Taylor?
RICK
What? Is he into teenage boys? I don't know. Ask Tom.
MARIAN
How would Tom know?
RICK
I'm sure Tom has asked Taylor. Or will.
MARIAN
That's hitting below the belt.
RICK
Like you, I believe in putting all my cards on the table. Were Randy's parents encouraged to leave? Were there financial rewards?
MARIAN
This is really none of your business.
RICK
Our two lady friends? They run the gay newspaper in Atlanta. This would make wonderful investigative journalism.
MARIAN
They could get sued.
RICK
Not if they did their job right.
MARIAN
And if I tell you?
RICK
And we're left alone?
MARIAN
I can't guarantee that.
RICK
I think Daddy could. My guess is the pot was sweetened to get Randy's folks and all other traces of Randy out of here. [Pause] I'll take silence as assent. And after all that money and effort, a bunch of faggots move in and gussy the place up. And your son is back over here. Delicious!
MARIAN
I'm glad you're enjoying this.
RICK
Oh, I am! How did Randy's father know where Randy and Tom were that night? Was your Daddy involved in that, too?
MARIAN
I think you've asked enough questions.
RICK
Shucks! I've just begun.
MARIAN
I'd appreciate it if you would get my husband and son. We should be going home.
RICK
Just one final question. Did you know Randy's father raped him that night after he chased Tom off? And left the gun for Randy to use?
MARIAN
Did Tom tell you that?
RICK
Tom was there.
MARIAN
[Stunned, but trying not to show it] I hadn't heard that. And I doubt it.
RICK
Do you really? Well, I guess we're all caught up now. I'll get Hunter and Tom.
HUNTER
Tom's pretty shaken up. Almost hysterical. Rick's giving him a tranquilizer. He's staying here tonight.
MARIAN
I beg your pardon. He isn't staying here.
HUNTER
He's in good hands. Rick's a doctor, remember?
MARIAN
If Tom needs a doctor, he can go where he's always gone.
HUNTER
To your old family doctor? Are you sure you want him to have a report on what transpired here tonight?
MARIAN
Since when do you worry about that?
HUNTER
I don't.
MARIAN
What do expect me to say, Hunter? Touché? You win?
HUNTER
Never that, Marian. Never that.
MARIAN
Being around the boys has certainly steeled your nerve.
HUNTER
I don't consider a physician and a professor to be boys. At any rate, they didn't steel my nerve, as you put it. That meeting your father engineered did that. And your merciless behavior toward Tom.
MARIAN
You know no one here would accept what was going on with Randy.
HUNTER
It was no one's business but ours.
MARIAN
Don't be naive.
HUNTER
You would sacrifice your son for the sake of appearances? It's disgusting!
MARIAN
Oh, shut up, Hunter!
HUNTER
I've said my piece.
MARIAN
Are you staying here, too? Is the bed big enough for all of you?
HUNTER
Oh, Marian, you're off form tonight. Surely you can do better than that.
MARIAN
But you think my son is staying here despite any protest or objection. There are laws, Hunter.
HUNTER
Call your father, as I'm sure you will. He'll find one or two or bend a dozen. Meanwhile Tom either stays here—under a doctor's care I might add— or I take him to an emergency room. There's no law against his being here.
MARIAN
I don't want him here.
HUNTER
I do. An impasse.
MARIAN
I want to go home.
HUNTER
I'll drop you off.
MARIAN
Where are you going?
HUNTER
I don't know. To think.
MARIAN
About what?
HUNTER
I hate what I've seen and heard tonight. I have to think about what that means for me.
MARIAN
Are you thinking about leaving me?
HUNTER
I'm sure Daddy will stop that, too.
MARIAN
He damn well might.
HUNTER
Marian, I need to figure out what's left for us.
MARIAN
You need to figure that out? I figured it out a long time ago. We do what we have to.
HUNTER
Have to? By whose law?
MARIAN
If we separate, you may just lose everything. The paper, your son. Everything.
HUNTER
You and Daddy would see to that, wouldn't you? Why do you want to keep me?
MARIAN
Because I refuse to face the mockery of having you leave me. I refuse to have people think I failed at this marriage.
HUNTER
You haven't failed. You've worked very hard at it. It's just that it shouldn't have been such work.
MARIAN
What should it have been, Hunter? Pleasure?
HUNTER
There are couples who enjoy each other.
MARIAN
Like Sam and Rick? Or Tom and Randy?
HUNTER
I don't know about Sam and Rick. Or Tom and Randy. Though I should have known.
MARIAN
What would you have done about it?
HUNTER
I don't know. Maybe nothing. Tom was happy for the first time in his life the year before Randy died. Finally we had a happy kid. Then Randy's death and he was worse than ever. A time bomb.
MARIAN
He thinks I'm partly responsible for Randy's death.
HUNTER
Aren't you? You told "Daddy."
MARIAN
He had a man-to-man talk with Randy's father.
HUNTER
Who raped his son and left the gun for him to kill himself. My God!
MARIAN
So they got that news to you?
HUNTER
Sam told me.
MARIAN
I don't believe it happened.
HUNTER
You'd have made a great Nazi. It did happen. And you're responsible for that brutality. You and your father. Randy was as good as murdered.
MARIAN
That's a bit strong.
HUNTER
Is it? Did you feel any sorrow for that boy? He just about lived with us since he was five.
MARIAN
Not after what he did.
HUNTER
He didn't do it alone, Marian. Do you feel as little for Tom? Would you care as little if Tom had succeeded in killing himself last fall?
MARIAN
Oh, I was feeling something. Such anger I thought I would burst.
HUNTER
You're merciless, Marian. Like your father. Like so many of the good folk whose opinion means so much to you. I hate that southern hardness.
MARIAN
As much as I hate softness?
HUNTER
Humanity is not softness, Marian. This is a nightmare. I've got to get out of here.
MARIAN
So do I.
HUNTER
I'll drop you off home.
MARIAN
I'll walk.
HUNTER
As you wish.
MARIAN
You will not leave me.
HUNTER
That will be my decision, Marian. Not yours or your father's.
SAM
Rick's upstairs with Tom. He'll be okay.
HUNTER
We're leaving. Thanks.
SAM
Are you going to be okay?
HUNTER
Don't worry about me. Worry about Tom. And yourself.
SAM
We'll get Tom to school.
HUNTER
Thanks. I'd like to look in on Tom before I go.
SAM
Sure. Go ahead.
RICK
Hunter's checking on Tom.
SAM
I know. Everything alright up there?
RICK
Tom's out like a light. For a few hours, at least.
SAM
And Taylor?
RICK
He's pretty tired. He'll sleep.
SAM
And you?
RICK
I'll live. I can deal with the Marians of this world. I admire her will, however misguided. I can deal with the bigotry. If it gets out of hand, there's always the city to hide in. What I can't deal with is your ambivalence about being gay. If you aren't clear on that, where are we?
SAM
I'm clear on us. But Taylor? I don't know if I want him to go through what we went through.
RICK
You fought it for so long, Sam. Through two years with a shrink and ten with a wife.
SAM
I fought it because I didn't think what we had was possible. Now that I have it, I'll fight with all I have to keep it.
RICK
Are you sure?
SAM
Yes, I'm sure. I'm sorry about what I said before. Taylor should be so lucky as to find a Rick Martinez.
RICK
I'm spoken for. Though there are moments I regret it.
SAM
I can be an idiot. And you're right. I love you.
RICK
Likewise.
HUNTER
The boys are asleep.
SAM
Rick just got paged. He may have to go to the hospital.
HUNTER
I'd better go, too.
SAM
Where are you going?
HUNTER
For a drive, I guess. To think.
SAM
You're welcome to crash here. Join the crowd.
HUNTER
I really need to get out and think.
SAM
I understand.
HUNTER
I can't stay with her. How could she know all that and not tell me? She and her father put the gun to that boy's head.
SAM
Marian and her father are just products of this place.
HUNTER
They're more responsible than that, Sam. They don't get off that easily.
RICK
I've got to go to the hospital. One of my patients is in crisis. One more piece of information—Marian's father got Randy's parents out of here—money and threats.
HUNTER
If anything nasty happens around here, it will get in the paper, despite him.
RICK
That's nice, but will any of your readers give a shit? Gotta go.
HUNTER
I'm truly sorry about all this.
SAM
So far it's only words and a broken window. Worry about your son.
HUNTER
Thanks, Sam. Good night.
TOM
Taylor, are you awake?
TAYLOR
Yeah.
TOM
What was your mother like?
TAYLOR
She was pretty tough, but devoted.
TOM
Did she talk to you?
TAYLOR
Sure. Too much sometimes.
TOM
Do you miss her?
TAYLOR
Yeah. But Dad and Rick are being great.
TOM
They're incredible.
TAYLOR
We should get some sleep.
TOM
She knew all the time, Taylor. She never said a word to me.
TAYLOR
You never said anything to her either.
TOM
You know why I didn't! She'd have sent me away.
TAYLOR
But you want to get away.
TOM
Not to where she'd send me. She'd send me off to a military school or something.
TAYLOR
She just wants you to fit in.
TOM
Her way. I don't want to fit in here. [After a pause] You'll stick with me?
TAYLOR
Yeah. We'd better stick together. It's two against just about everybody. You ever take self-defense?
TOM
No. I don't think—
TAYLOR
You're going. We'll start this weekend. Now let's get some sleep.
TOM
I just need to hold you.
TAYLOR
I'm not Randy.
TOM
I know.
TAYLOR
I like you. As a friend. That's all now.
TOM
Are you—
TAYLOR
Gay? I don't know. I don't think it matters much.
TOM
What do you mean?
TAYLOR
Just that. It doesn't matter if it's a guy or a girl as long as you feel something more than just a hard on. I'm waiting for that.
TOM
I did for Randy.
TAYLOR
I know. I know it doesn't seem that way, but you're lucky. I'd like to feel something like that. But I don't now.
TOM
Has anyone ever given you a hard-on?
TAYLOR
Sure. Too many people.
TOM
Guys?
TAYLOR
Some. Some girls.
TOM
I've only been turned on by guys.
TAYLOR
Maybe that makes things easier. Less confusing.
TOM
Have you ever had sex?
TAYLOR
No.
TOM
[Puts his arm around TAYLOR's waist] Would it be such a big deal if we—
TAYLOR
[Sits up] Now? It would screw things up big time. And things are pretty screwed up now.
TOM
I know. What's going to happen tomorrow?
TAYLOR
How?
TOM
When I have to go home. And face her.
TAYLOR
I don't know. You're going to have to do it sometime.
TOM
I could disappear.
TAYLOR
How far could you get with no money?
TOM
People have done it.
TAYLOR
The best thing you could do tonight is get some sleep. You'll have a clearer head tomorrow.
TOM
Can't we sleep together? Just sleep. I promise.
TAYLOR
Just sleep. Sure. But we might as well use the bed.
TOM
Have you ever been like this?
TAYLOR
No.
TOM
Do you mind?
TAYLOR
I guess not. Go to sleep.
TOM
You have a hard-on.
TAYLOR
So do you. Go to sleep.
TOM
I hope you'll feel more someday.
TAYLOR
So do Í.
TOM
Forme.
TAYLOR
I want us to be friends.
TOM
So do I. That, too.
TAYLOR
You go too fast.
TOM
Randy said that too.
TAYLOR
I believe it. Shhh! Sleep.
RANDY
Tommy.
TOM
[Sees RANDY. Jumps up.] Randy? My God! What are you ...
RANDY
I live here.
TOM
You mean?
RANDY
Just like Patrick Swayze in Ghost.
TOM
And I'm Whoopi Goldberg, right?
RANDY
You could do worse. [Looking at TAYLOR. Pulls covers back for a better look.] You could do worse than him, too.
TOM
You've changed.
RANDY
Death will do that to a girl.
TOM
You never used to talk like that.
RANDY
We all camp out here. It's a riot. Queer paradise,
TOM
Don't leave me again.
RANDY
I'm not coming back, Tommy. I just wanted to say a proper good-bye. And to warn you. This house is about to blow. If you smell any smoke, scream bloody murder. Get your friends out of here. Particularly him. You don't want to lose him.
TOM
He's not interested....
RANDY
Bullshit! Be patient. He'll take care of you, Tommy. I wouldn't have. Gotta go. Love ya.
TOM
Me, too.
TOM
[At the top of his lungs] FIRE!!! FIRE!!!
HUNTER
The Molotov cocktail went through the living room window. Sam was asleep on the couch. He's pretty badly burned. Tom and Taylor got him out.
MARIAN
The house?
HUNTER
The fire department took its own sweet time getting there. The house is gutted. The police are making a report. They won't do anything.
MARIAN
Can Tom come home tonight?
HUNTER
Rick's finding out if they can be released. He'll bring the boys home.
MARIAN
One big happy family.
HUNTER
Not very happy right now. Tom wants Taylor to stay here if they get out tonight.
MARIAN
And Rick?
HUNTER
I don't know. I offered.
MARIAN
And you?
HUNTER
I'll sleep here. Somewhere. Perhaps you want to go to your father's.
MARIAN
I'm staying here.
HUNTER
With all these horrible people in your house?
MARIAN
I've been thinking all night. I believed everything that happened was because of what those boys did.
HUNTER
Sin and retribution.
MARIAN
Yes.
HUNTER
It was Randy's fault he was raped and led to kill himself? It's Sam's fault he was almost killed tonight?
MARIAN
It makes less sense now.
HUNTER
Tonight I saw two men kiss. I've never seen that. My system went cold— like it didn't know how to take in that data. It was a loving kiss. I can't imagine feeling that for a man. But it is love, Marian. I don't understand it, but it is love. I want to understand. I want to feel more for Tom than I do. I didn't see anything bad.
MARIAN
Every fiber of my being tells me it's wrong.
HUNTER
Can you love Tom?
MARIAN
I don't know.
HUNTER
Do you want to?
MARIAN
Yes.
HUNTER
That's something. What was the message from "Daddy"?
MARIAN
He wants you to help cool things down.
HUNTER
That's what he's thinking about now? Jesus! Doesn't he care at all about Tom?
MARIAN
He thinks that Tom shouldn't have been there.
HUNTER
I see. Blame the victim.
MARIAN
He says he had nothing to do with the fire.
HUNTER
He led the campaign against those people.
MARIAN
He said he thought words would do it.
HUNTER
Words! Some people take his words rather literally.
MARIAN
You're to play it down in the paper. There was a fire. That's all.
HUNTER
And a man was almost burned to death. Our son could have been killed!
MARIAN
He wants you to keep out of this.
HUNTER
Or?
MARIAN
He didn't say.
HUNTER
There are other papers.
MARIAN
Are you going to quit?
HUNTER
No. I might shop the story.
MARIAN
There's no story.
HUNTER
I'm sure there is one. And Daddy's involved.
MARIAN
He said he thought you'd try to be a hero.
HUNTER
Better to try to be a hero than to settle for being a rottweiler.
MARIAN
You'll lose. You're not ruthless enough
HUNTER
Did he say that?
MARIAN
No. I did.
HUNTER
Maybe I should say, "Thank you." But I know you can no longer play fair and win. The viciousness that is unleashed in the name of values! It's sickening!
MARIAN
Please, for God's sake, get off your high horse!
HUNTER
Self-righteousness is in fashion right now.
MARIAN
Well, I'm sick of it all. Daddy's constant rage at the evils of the world. Your goodness. Tommy's wounded look. I just want it all to be over.
HUNTER
It isn't going to be. They're going to stand their ground.
MARIAN
And Tommy's going to stand it with them.
HUNTER
I think so. More power to him.
MARIAN
And you?
HUNTER
I'll cheer them on. Help them when I can. But I'm an outsider.
MARIAN
And Tom isn't an outsider?
HUNTER
With them? You know he isn't.
MARIAN
But he's an outsider with us?
HUNTER
He has been for quite awhile, I'm afraid. Hasn't he?
MARIAN
Yes. He has. So there's a war going on, and our son is on the other side.
HUNTER
There needn't be a war.
MARIAN
My father disagrees.
HUNTER
Do you have to agree with him on this?
MARIAN
I don't know!
HUNTER
That's a start. But do you really have the guts to fight him?
MARIAN
I don't know. I don't know if I want to.
HUNTER
Exactly. The irony is that Sam and Rick want the same things we do.
MARIAN
I doubt that.
HUNTER
You don't know them.
MARIAN
Neither do you.
HUNTER
I saw a lot tonight.
TOM
No I'm not feeling alright. Taylor is spending the night here
RICK
I wouldn't agree to this, but I really have nowhere for him to go now.
HUNTER
It's fine. Isn't it, Marian?
MARIAN
Sure. This is Freedom Hall.
HUNTER
Why don't you boys go on to bed? You must be exhausted.
RICK
I rustled up some scrub suits for the boys. I'll do something about clothes for Taylor tomorrow.
HUNTER
Don't worry about it. He can borrow some of Tom's. Do you need a place to stay?
RICK
I'll go back to the hospital. To be near Sam. [To MARIAN] Don't worry.
MARIAN
You are the least of my worries right now.
RICK
Likewise, I'm sure.
HUNTER
Do you want anything?
RICK
Got any coffee?
MARIAN
I'll get it.
HUNTER
I'll check on the boys.
RICK
Are you alright?
MARIAN
What do you think? My home has fallen apart.
RICK
Really? Mine has burned down. With my lover in it.
MARIAN
How is he?
RICK
Do you really care?
MARIAN
I don't know.
RICK
That's honest. He's badly burned. Smoke inhalation. And shock.
MARIAN
I'm sorry.
RICK
Are you? You might be interested to know that Tom was the real hero. He got Taylor up and went right through the fire to get Sam. I'll always be grateful to him.
MARIAN
How bad are his burns?
RICK
Tom's? He'll be okay. Some scar tissue, maybe, but they can fix that. Tom's pretty used to scar tissue.
MARIAN
Oh, really? I've done that to him, I suppose.
RICK
This place has done that to him.
MARIAN
You people love to be martyrs. You're totally innocent, and we bigots are out to crucify you. Right? We're supposed to think it's all just great. Come on in everybody with your rainbow flags and pink triangles and leather and earrings, promiscuity and disease. You're welcome.
RICK
God, I'm tired of this. We, you might have noticed, do not wear earrings or leather. And it would be none of your business if we did. I watched one brave young man die tonight alone. Yes, of AIDS. His parents wouldn't come to the hospital. They thought his illness and death were his own fault. Merciless bastards. Then I got the news about my home and family. A fine man was almost burned to death. Our home was firebombed by hateful bastards who think like you. Strange as it may seem, I think that's a hell of a lot worse than earrings and consensual sex. Fuck you, lady. Fuck you all.
MARIAN
I don't know what I believe anymore. I don't know what I feel anymore. I hate this ambiguity, this confusion.
RICK
Your son could have been killed in there! That would have simplified your life.
MARIAN
Don't think I didn't think that. And hate myself for thinking it.
RICK
At least you hated yourself for a change.
MARIAN
I don't like the things I've felt. They're part of me. And not so easily gotten rid of.
RICK
I know. You breathe them in the air around here.
MARIAN
I'm sorry about your—Sam—and the house. It's wrong.
RICK
It sure as hell is.
MARIAN
Earlier tonight I said I hoped your place would burn down. I'm sorry for that, too.
RICK
You think you gave someone the idea?
MARIAN
I think a lot of people had the idea.
RICK
I'm sure of that.
MARIAN
Do you still plan to stay?
RICK
I swore at age twenty that I'd never be run out of anyplace again.
MARIAN
You're an ornery cuss, aren't you?
RICK
Some people have to be.
MARIAN
Exactly.
RICK
Why?
MARIAN
Hunter wants the world to know about what happened tonight. He wants to discover who's responsible. Daddy will fire him.
RICK
Even if that hurts you and Tom?
MARIAN
He's given up on Tom. And I'm supposed to keep Hunter in line.
RICK
Jesus! And if you don't?
MARIAN
We've got my teacher's salary.
RICK
He really would disown you, too?
MARIAN
What were you saying about unconditional love?
RICK
It's not one of the traditional family values?
MARIAN
It's not at the top of my father's list.
RICK
I've always believed if you're dumped on by the family you were born into, make another one.
MARIAN
That's not so easy around here.
RICK
I know. I see what my patients go through. Don't you ever get pissed off at your father? Haven't you ever told him to bug off?
MARIAN
I thought lightning would strike.
RICK
It struck us.
MARIAN
It will strike again. It could strike us. He's the voice of the people around here, Rick. They don't do things for him because of his money or power. They do things because they agree with him.
RICK
Do you know the Ku Klux Klan's active again in Florida? They're not after blacks anymore. Or Jews. They've got us now. And the Pat Robertsons of this world are on TV every day revving them up—and making millions doing it. Hitler missed out. There's big bucks in hate these days. And somebody's got to draw the line against these people.
MARIAN
That's just what they say.
RICK
I know. I've heard them.
MARIAN
J After a thoughtful pause] I want Taylor to stay here as long as you need.
RICK
Why the turnaround?
MARIAN
For Tom. I'd like Tom to think we're family. He hasn't for a long time. I was frightened for so long that he'd be ...
RICK
Gay? The suspense is over. He is.
MARIAN
I know. I've got to stand up for him.
RICK
You're terrific.
MARIAN
You were right before. I do need a friend.
RICK
Done.
MARIAN
I don't want Tom to get sick.
RICK
AIDS? He shouldn't. If he's careful. I could explain. Or you and Hunter could.
MARIAN
About sex?
RICK
About safe sex, yes.
MARIAN
I can't even think about him doing that.
RICK
He will anyway. He has.
MARIAN
Then explain. Please. Thanks.
RICK
Yeah. We were just having a heart to heart.
HUNTER
Really?
MARIAN
We haven't scratched each other's eyes out.
HUNTER
So I see.
RICK
Yes, Dennis. ... No shit. . . . Alright. . . . Thanks. We'll see you soon. [He hangs up.] Marian, you'd better sit down.
MARIAN
I'm alright. Who was that?
RICK
A newyoung assistant D.A. was called over to the prison. Dennis Pugh. Sam was his favorite prof at Emory. He's kept in touch with Sam and me.
HUNTER
It's purely an accident that Dennis was called into this. Wiley's out of town for a week. He'd have seen to it that this didn't happen.
MARIAN
What?
RICK
Hunter?
HUNTER
The license number belonged to Jimmy Foster's pickup. He works at the print shop. The fire was set with a solvent they use there.
MARIAN
And?
HUNTER
He's not a good soldier. He doesn't want to go down for this by himself. He's willing to testify against the person who paid him to do it.
MARIAN
Oh my God.
HUNTER
Marian, your father will get around it. A jury will never convict him in this town. Too many people don't think what he did was wrong.
MARIAN
Does he know?
HUNTER
Yes.
MARIAN
No matter what happens, he'll never believe he's wrong.
RICK
[To MARIAN] Are you alright?
MARIAN
I need a drink.
RICK
I'd better get back to the hospital. Hunter has the number where I can be reached. Good night. [He starts to leave.]
MARIAN
Rick?
RICK
Yes.
MARIAN
I'll bring the boys to the hospital after school.
RICK
Thanks.
MARIAN
And you and Sam can use the guest room.
RICK
Let's not get carried away.
MARIAN
I'm serious. We owe you that much. And you are our neighbors.
RICK
We sure are. Thanks. We might take you up on that.
TOM
Oh my God! What are you doing?
MARIAN
I was just tucking you in.
TOM
You haven't done that in years.
MARIAN
I felt like doing it tonight. Okay?
TOM
He was really upset. He cried himself to sleep.
MARIAN
In your arms.
TOM
Yes. I—
MARIAN
We need to talk.
TOM
You can't stop my feelings.
MARIAN
I know. Nor can I stop mine all at once. Didn't you read The Merchant of Venice in school?
TOM
What's that got to do with—
MARIAN
Oh, everything! Somehow it came to mind tonight as I was thinking about things. I've taught it for years and never really thought about it. "The quality of mercy ..I've been ... merciless. I was raised to be merciless. I want to change that.
TOM
Good!
MARIAN
But you have to be merciful, too. It's not so easy, believe me!
TOM
Oh, I know!
MARIAN
When I figured out what was going on with you and Randy, I told my father. And he told Randy's father.
TOM
Do you really expect me ever to feel anything good for you?
MARIAN
The quality of mercy, Tom. Please hear me out. I was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm almost forty and I've never stopped being Daddy's daughter. I don't know how your father has put up with it, but he has. In a way I was angry at him for putting up with it. Now, before it's too late, I want to be your mother. We both have to want that. You haven't always been easy on me either, you know.
TOM
I know.
MARIAN
So? Truce?
TOM
Not this fast.
MARIAN
Fair enough. Can we talk again?
TOM
Tomorrow.
MARIAN
Yes, tomorrow. [She gets up, starts to leave. Looks back at the two boys. Quietly, really to herself] I think I envy you.
TOM
What?
MARIAN
Just foolishness. Good night,
TOM
Good night.
MARIAN
I could use one of those.
HUNTER
Coming right up.
MARIAN
I looked in on the boys.
HUNTER
And?
MARIAN
As you saw them. All tangled together. More like bear cubs than lovers, but maybe that's wishful thinking.
HUNTER
I know that's going to take some getting used to.
MARIAN
It helps to know it's not easy for you either.
HUNTER
I'd like to think it's our problem, not theirs.
MARIAN
Problem? Caught you!
HUNTER
I was raised here, too.
MARIAN
I know. We've got other problems. Like living on my salary.
HUNTER
I don't plan to be unemployed.
MARIAN
I'm glad to hear it. What are you going to say to him tomorrow?
HUNTER
I'm not going to say anything. I'm going to write the story and run it. If he wants to fire me after that, fine.
MARIAN
He will. But that's alright?
HUNTER
You're joining me on my liberal high horse?
MARIAN
Only if it's going somewhere.
HUNTER
A lot of fighters have been mobilized tonight.
MARIAN
More on the other side.
HUNTER
I've always liked the story of David and Goliath. What about you?
MARIAN
I've always been a fighter.
HUNTER
I noticed. Gird your loins. Your father's car just pulled into the driveway.
BAILEY
I imagine Dennis Pugh has talked to you.
HUNTER
Yes. And to Rick Martinez.
BAILEY
Wiley's flying right back to take over the case. There have been some procedural irregularities.
HUNTER
We assumed there would be.
BAILEY
Nothing will happen.
HUNTER
There's always the high calling of journalism.
BAILEY
You don't think your exposé will appear in my paper?
HUNTER
It will appear somewhere.
BAILEY
You're going to risk your livelihood for those two? You're crazy Marian?
MARIAN
Daddy, I've spent most of my life accepting without question everything you believed and said. Like you were Jehovah. I don't anymore. And, frankly, I've come to dislike Jehovah. I don't know what I believe about a lot of things, but I know that what happened was wrong. Very wrong. And that I want to get to know my son. His friend Taylor will be staying here for awhile. As will his father and Rick.
BAILEY
That boy is here now?
MARIAN
Yes. He's in with Tom.
BAILEY
Then Tom's coming with me.
BAILEY
Get the hell out of that bed!
MARIAN
You keep away from our son.
HUNTER
There will be none of that in our house. Understand?
MARIAN
Are you alright, Tom?
TOM
I'll be alright.
BAILEY
You are not family to me.
MARIAN
That's up to you, Daddy. We're not going anywhere.
BAILEY
That's what you think.
HUNTER
Let's check your wounds, Tom,
TAYLOR
It's just bruises.
TOM
I'm okay.
MARIAN
Are you sure?
TOM
Yeah. He's not finished with us.
MARIAN
Doesn't look like it.
HUNTER
Let's all get to a hotel in Atlanta. I can phone the hospital and tell Rick where we are.
TOM
We've got to stay. We've got to fight them.
MARIAN
I'm afraid we do,
TOM
Boy, you've changed tonight.
MARIAN
Some. I want us to be a family.
TAYLOR
He wouldn't burn this place down.
HUNTER
I wouldn't put it past him. It's the saddest thing about human history— that you've often got to protect yourself from the good people. Can you sleep?
TOM
No. You, Taylor?
TAYLOR
No.
MARIAN
Well, come on down to the kitchen. Let's see what we've got to eat.
HUNTER
The war isn't over by any means. But we're not going to retreat. You've just got to believe that the haters will lose—eventually. Most people really don't enjoy hating.
JULIAN
Listen.
STEPHEN
Go on.
JULIAN
I never was attached to that great sect, Whose doctrine is, that each one should select Out of the crowd a mistress or a friend, And all the rest, though fair and wise, command To cold oblivion, though it is in the code Of modern morals, and the beaten road Which those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread, Who travel to their home among the dead By the broad highway of the world, and so With one chained friend, perhaps a jealous foe, The dreariest and the longest journey go.
STEPHEN
I wouldn't say anything behind your back.
JULIAN
You wouldn't?
STEPHEN
No, I wouldn't. Anything I'd say I'd say to your face.
JULIAN
Oh yeah? Look at the bags under my eyes. Like what would you say? Is this shirt okay?
STEPHEN
Yeah.
JULIAN
It's not.
STEPHEN
It is.
JULIAN
But what would you say behind my back?
STEPHEN
Stop it.
JULIAN
My hair ...
STEPHEN
I'd say.
JULIAN
What would you say?
STEPHEN
I'd say, "He's got nothing and he is everything."
JULIAN
Fuck off, Stephen.
STEPHEN
What?
JULIAN
Fuck off.
STEPHEN
What?
JULIAN
Just fuck off.
STEPHEN
Why should you change? You're alright as you are.
JULIAN
But I want to change, so how can you think I'm alright as I am? I should change.
STEPHEN
I don't want you to change.
JULIAN
You do.
STEPHEN
No, fuck it. Give yourself...
JULIAN
You wish me to change.
STEPHEN
No.
JULIAN
And I should change.
STEPHEN
For fuck's sake, you're young, young. Be young. Or you'll always just be young.
JULIAN
Stephen, why do you bother with me?
STEPHEN
Julian.
JULIAN
No, why?
STEPHEN
You're my representative in the world of ball games.
JULIAN
Stephen. Are you making fun of me? Just tell me.
STEPHEN
No.
JULIAN
Are you laughing at me?
STEPHEN
No.
JULIAN
Really?
STEPHEN
Look. You know I'm not. Why should I be?
JULIAN
I just thought you might be.
STEPHEN
Well, I'm not.
JULIAN
Stephen, I'm fond of you, you know. You're ...
STEPHEN
Last of the good guys, me.
JULIAN
It's just, can't you...? No, forget it.
STEPHEN
What?
JULIAN
It's alright. Do you want a cup of tea?
STEPHEN
Oh. Christ. Julian!
JULIAN
I'm a horrible person. Do you think I've got glandular fever?
STEPHEN
Yes. No.
JULIAN
Fuck it. No cigarettes.
STEPHEN
You're a terrible boy, you are.
JULIAN
Am I? I'm not. Am I?
STEPHEN
You're terrible! Here.
JULIAN
Two? Where'd you get them? You're great.
STEPHEN
You're a bloody terrible boy.
JULIAN
You really think I am, don't you?
STEPHEN
Of course you will.
JULIAN
I don't think I shall ever get married. I shall end up an old man in a hotel room.
STEPHEN
Did you phone home?
JULIAN
No. Yes.
STEPHEN
What did you say?
JULIAN
I said I was sorry.
STEPHEN
What about?
JULIAN
There was a row.
STEPHEN
What about? When?
JULIAN
Oh. Nothing, everything, the usual. Him. And them sending us away to school.
STEPHEN
Yes, we're all victims of the class struggle.
JULIAN
We fucking are.
STEPHEN
Are we?
JULIAN
Were you sent away to school?
STEPHEN
No.
JULIAN
At five? Halfway across the world?
STEPHEN
No.
JULIAN
No.
STEPHEN
That I was spared.
JULIAN
Oh fuck off, you.
STEPHEN
I mean it. Come on.
JULIAN
Stephen.
STEPHEN
What?
JULIAN
It's ... nothing.
STEPHEN
What?
JULIAN
Was it my fault?
STEPHEN
How could it be your fault? It happened to you.
JULIAN
I thought it was my fault. I thought he'd blame me. Dad. Not locking my front door.
STEPHEN
But you locked the front door.
JULIAN
I know. That's what started the row. I threw the table over. I'm fucking glad. Was it my fault?
STEPHEN
How could it be your fault? It was you it happened to.
JULIAN
I'm sorry.
STEPHEN
Don't be sorry about it. There was a burglary. You were burgled. You. You were.
JULIAN
Do you mind? Are you angry?
STEPHEN
I'm not.
JULIAN
You are.
STEPHEN
Why should I be angry?
JULIAN
It's the insurance.
STEPHEN
Are you insured?
JULIAN
Yes.
STEPHEN
I'm not.
JULIAN
My father insured me. I fucking hate him.
STEPHEN
Come on, Julian.
JULIAN
He gave me a briefcase with a combination lock for Christmas.
STEPHEN
You're such a snob.
JULIAN
Am I? I'm not. Am I?
STEPHEN
Which of those alternative comedians were at university with you, Julian?
JULIAN
None of them. I've told you those kind of people hated me.
STEPHEN
Oh, aye?
JULIAN
They did.
STEPHEN
Yes.
JULIAN
They did, Stephen. You're such a bastard. Am I a snob?
STEPHEN
Didn't you bonk or knob any of those girls who tell jokes about how they got thrush?
JULIAN
Stephen. [Laughs]
STEPHEN
No, of course most of them went to Manchester, didn't they, or Sussex, or Bangor? The thing about your mob when they do comedy is they make you realise how funny Jimmy Tarbuck is.
JULIAN
Well, I don't know of any Welsh humour of any sort.
STEPHEN
No, and there are no fucking folk songs in the Welsh coalfields either.
JULIAN
Yeah, and according to some sources there's no fucking coal either.
STEPHEN
Ohowoho. You're the only uneconomic pit round here. Were you up with Manfred M....? No, before your time. Julian. Did you go to school with Mike D'Abo? No, no, no, no, no, no.
JULIAN
You're so intolerant.
STEPHEN
I don't know. I was very understanding when you said you liked Don't Look Now.
JULIAN
Stephen. Do you like the Velvet Underground?
STEPHEN
Some of the Velvet Underground.
JULIAN
So you know that song "I'm Waiting for the Man"?
STEPHEN
I know that song "I'm Waiting for the Man."
JULIAN
That's a song about heroin.
STEPHEN
Is it?
JULIAN

STEPHEN
Hey, you.
JULIAN
What? Alright. So I do heroin now and again. I can handle it. I just got a touch of flu today. That's all.
STEPHEN
Listen, Lord Althorp. I mean it.
JULIAN
Would you?
STEPHEN
Yes.
JULIAN
Don't be stupid.
STEPHEN
Bob, yes. [Pause] Don't roll another joint.
JULIAN
One more. Can I? Can I? Can I?
STEPHEN
What do you mean can you? You've already rolled one.
JULIAN
"I'd be walking with an empty arm."
STEPHEN
God, please, no, anything. Bruce Springsteen.
JULIAN
Don't you even like Bowie?
STEPHEN
He's about as lasting as Nelson Eddy, David Bowie.
JULIAN
Who's Nelson Eddy? Don't you like anything at all?
STEPHEN
Look, I like the Band. I like the Kinks, Joe Cocker, Merle Haggard, Billie HOLLIDAY, Bessie Smith. George O'Dowd has a perfectly good voice. Cliff Richard has a perfectly good voice.
JULIAN
Oh! Really!
STEPHEN
Julian, I am not the rock critic for Isis. I am not interested in the irony of the Velvet Underground as perceived by ... Terry Jones. Cliff Richard has a perfectly good voice.
JULIAN
So has David Bowie.
STEPHEN
Yes! I know. So has Nelson fucking Eddy.
JULIAN
You're the most restrictive person I've ever met.
STEPHEN
Ask your fucking father when next you have a row. "This one's for Brian."
JULIAN
Don't.
STEPHEN
"Life like a dome of many coloured glass stains the white radiance of the Universe."
JULIAN
The worst time was having to go to bed at 7
STEPHEN
Of course you have.
JULIAN
No, honestly.
STEPHEN
Yes. Tell me that joke.
JULIAN
Shall I? I'm tired.
STEPHEN
Come on.
JULIAN
Do you mean when Roebuck said, "Sir, what's the Latin for hinge?"
STEPHEN
No.
JULIAN
Well, when we were out, Roebuck and I, we used to find a telephone box, dial O, and when the operator answered, we used to say, "Is that you, operator?" And she'd say, "Yes," and we'd say, "Well, get off the line; there's a train coming."
STEPHEN
What?
JULIAN
England, I don't understand it. Let's go to Venice and Florence and Pisa, La Spezia and Viareggio and Leghorn and Rome.
STEPHEN
Hang on, we haven't been to Lords yet. You said you'd take me to Lords.
JULIAN
Would you like to go to Lords? It's great at Lords. We could spend the whole day there.
STEPHEN
Alright. I've been to Rome.
JULIAN
I've been to Florence. What does that matter? Did you go to the Baths of Caracalla? He wrote "Prometheus Unbound" in the Baths of Caracalla, Are they beautiful? Listen. [Reads] "This poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the Baths of Caracalla, among the flowery glades, and thickets of odiferous blossoming trees, which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air. The bright blue sky of Rome, and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate, and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication, were the inspiration of this drama."
STEPHEN
Come on then.
JULIAN
What?
STEPHEN
Let's go.
JULIAN
Stephen.
STEPHEN
Where did he write "Epipsychidion"?
JULIAN
I don't know. Lerici, I suppose.
STEPHEN
Let's go there then.
JULIAN
I haven't got any money.
STEPHEN
I've got money.
JULIAN
No. I can't take your money.
STEPHEN
You look at me as if I was fucking black magic, you know.
STEPHEN
Hello.
PAUL
You okay?
STEPHEN
Fuck off.
PAUL
[Laughs] Are you reading this?
STEPHEN
Don't.
PAUL
Have you been sailing paper boats in the park?
STEPHEN
Fuck off, Paul.
JULIAN
Paul... is this shirt okay?
PAUL
Great. Where'd you get it?
JULIAN
Do you like it?
PAUL
Great. See you later.
STEPHEN
Fuck off, Paul.
PAUL
So long.
STEPHEN
Paul.
PAUL
What?
STEPHEN
Fuck off.
PAUL
[Laughing] Oh, Celia's downstairs.
CELIA
Hello.
JULIAN
[Reading to CELIA]
CELIA
[Looking at volume] I wrote an essay on "Epipsychidion" when I was at university, but I never read it. There was a book out at the time. I cribbed it from that.
JULIAN
The Pursuit,
CELIA
I think so.
JULIAN
Are you having lunch?
CELIA
I suppose so.
JULIAN
Shall we have lunch together? Would you like that?
CELIA
Shouldn't we wait?
JULIAN
I suppose we should.
PAUL
Where's Stephen?
JULIAN
Out I should think.
PAUL
Where?
JULIAN
He should be on his way back from the library.
PAUL
Shall we go and meet him?
NELL
Yes, is it far?
PAUL
No.
NELL
Shall we bicycle?
PAUL
No.
NELL
Shall we see you?
JULIAN
I expect so.
NELL
See you then.
JULIAN
I don't think Paul likes me.
CELIA
Paul!
JULIAN
Fuck him.
CELIA
Is Nell a friend of Paul's?
JULIAN
I don't know. Look. Come on. Let's go to lunch. I hate crowds, don't you?
CELIA
Alright. Where shall we go?
JULIAN
I know a very nice place. Well, I think it's nice. Do you want to try it?
CELIA
Of course. Where is it?
JULIAN
Holland Park.
CELIA
That'll be nice. Where? Oh! That. . . girl's name.
JULIAN
Yes.
CELIA
Where are my keys? [JULIAN finds them.] What about Stephen?
JULIAN
Fuck Stephen.
CELIA
No.
JULIAN
Do you?
CELIA
No.
JULIAN
Celia. Listen, is this shirt okay?
CELIA
Yes.
NELL
We gave up at the front door.
PAUL
Nell did. You off somewhere?
JULIAN
Yes. Is that okay?
PAUL
What?
JULIAN
Is it?
CELIA
Come along. Bye-bye, Paul.
PAUL
Here, take this. If I'm seen with Private Eye, I'm in trouble.
NELL
With whom?
PAUL
With myself. How long before you've got to go?
NELL
Fairly soon.
PAUL
You always say that.
NELL
Do I?
PAUL
You do. What is it?
NELL
I've never been here before.
PAUL
Yes, you have.
NELL
Not here.
PAUL
How's Keith?
NELL
He's fine, fine. He's fine.
STEPHEN
Hello. Hello, Nell. Here. [Gives PAUL some magazines]
PAUL
Thanks.
STEPHEN
They didn't have the London Review of Books, so I got Newsline. He loves print. Newsprint. He's the only person I know who says he reads City Limits for the sport. Where's Julian?
NELL
They've . . .
PAUL
Haven't seen him.
JULIAN
Say.
STEPHEN
No, I'm not saying. You work it out. Why should I come out with a lot of recriminations? You're happy. Off you go—have a drink—meet whoever—if you didn't want to meet me tonight, you just had to say—now—go and meet whoever for whatever reason—you see now I'm doing it. What I didn't want to. I hate you for this. I do. If you apologise once more and don't even follow the apology through with something and then go on apologising, I'll ... I don't mind. I don't want you to change. I'll—I'll just wait for the time when I can say—why did I ever feel this about you? I look and watch and wait for you like a kid outside a pub sitting on the kerb or a step. Tired and waiting and still I wait. And I still wait. And I wait still. Look at the clock on the wall. But I haven't a time to expect you by. But twenty minutes have passed. I go back to my book to read something that makes me look up to see if you've come yet. The noise I've blocked out reestablishes. Glasses. Getting ready for the last haul before time is called. Phone at the other end. Singing has stopped. Clock. Don't look at faces—as I return one redheaded woman gesticulating imposes herself. Crisp packets crackle. Glasses again. The noice is not unpleasant. Bit loud. I look up. I shall go. Leave you a note saying I've gone. Had you something more interesting. Wasn't there a half promise? See you in the. I'll go. Not angry. Or shall I stay? Oh, come on. Is it? No. I know you're not coming. I leave a polite note saying, "You bastard."
JULIAN
Look, I've got to go.
STEPHEN
Where are you going? I'm sorry. I don't think anyone has ever been so cruel to me ever. So gratuitously. No. Yes. Cruel. They have been, I suppose. Ever. Not casually, culpably. Don't apologise. I can't think about it anymore. I've managed to survive months of this; I've managed even to survive the redhead with the short stories. But I can't go on unprotected any longer.
JULIAN
Stephen. Lindy! Stephen.
STEPHEN
You told me you thought she was very nice. You told me you thought she was very talented.
JULIAN
Did I? Oh God.
STEPHEN
And then she sent me the manuscripts.
STEPHEN
You've got some light. Some glow. I find myself crying and you know—I don't even know what it is I'm feeling. I don't know if I'm unhappy or not. I don't even fucking like you. I've located a part of myself in you. And I dread the feeling in the future of my sense of worthlessness now at having been so shallow all the time.
JULIAN
But you can't let it be like this. Me!
STEPHEN
Because there has to be a reason to get up in the morning. I have to have some defence.
JULIAN
Against what?
STEPHEN
That place.
JULIAN
Where? Work? Against what?
STEPHEN
The mendacity. The envy. The fear. The lack of principle. The mismanagement, the lack of vision, the self-interest. One's self-interest. The atmosphere of witch-hunt, the wish to make things worse. The mishandling, the pusillanimity. The unkindness. The lack of any care, the lack of guts to even stab Caesar when he's dead. "Speak hands for me." The trivial nature, the residue of complacency and dissatisfaction and graft. The exhausted ideals, the lack of perspective, the dead wood, the mediocrity, the vacillation, the meanness of spirit, the gutless, not even opportunism. The terminal air.
JULIAN
I can't go on with this. I can't go on talking because you ... such ... You mustn't. I can't stand it. I can't have it. Do you understand? I'd like to bang my head against a wall. If this is about Celia. If you're quizzing me about Celia. There's nothing I can do about it. Do you understand? Do you understand? Do you understand? You just want me to be infinitely flexible and you resent my life. You do, Stephen. And you're so very clever at making me feel obscurely guilty and 1 resent it. I resent it. I'm tired. I haven't got the same emotional stamina as you!
STEPHEN
You selfish little bastard. It's not emotional stamina. You're a coward. You're tired because you're doped out and you're a coward.
JULIAN
Leave me alone. I'm wrecked. I've got a headache.
STEPHEN
You have no strength; you're a fucking coward. It's weakness. You're just weak. "Just give me some space for a minute—space—give me space. I need space. You don't allow me my space. I have to have space, okay." Sixties doped-out nonsense like that. Don't apologise—you're like a drunk. And if you're going to get as stoned as you were last night. There comes a point when one can't have anymore to say to you.
JULIAN
Do you think you were sent by God to change me? You make me feel guilty. Why do you look with such reproach?
STEPHEN
Don't you dare use the word reproachful to me as a reproach. What you're saying is if I look reproachful, you don't like it. I'll punish you. I'll hold it against you, you say. I want something—you really can't give it. You make me feel hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless. What you're saying is I'm tired mummy. I'm tired. You perceive a look as a reproach. You don't like reproach and you say I'm tired. I'm going fucking mad. I hear something on the radio and I laugh because it's going to be something I like and I think, got you, you bastard. Then I feel the pain of wanting to share it with you—pain that you wouldn't really want to . . . and then I feel I can't sustain the hate—the feeling current in me is too weak and the tears start and then, to cap it all, before our next programme they play Schubert's "Seligkeit." Do you remember when I was a character witness over your driving offence? And I thought in that awful court if I was in jail, you'd forget to come or come late. I'd look at the clock and five, ten, fifteen minutes late you'd be. Then awkward. It will be time to go. I used to like love songs. Now they have no meaning. Sentimental songs have to be pretty good now.
JULIAN
We don't ever have any fun anymore. You're depressed anyway. That's okay. Don't worry.
STEPHEN
Well, then, let's say good-bye. No. Come on. In that case don't let's fuck about. Just tell me to fuck off.
JULIAN
No. Come on, Stephen. Don't be stupid.
STEPHEN
Shake hands with me. Come on.
JULIAN
No.
STEPHEN
We both seem to be determined to be ourselves to our mutual disadvantage. And let no one think they are protecting me by any hole-in-the-corner affair, when what they are protecting is something quite else.
JULIAN
It's not you; it's ...
STEPHEN
The man Celia's going out with? That aging television man who irons his jeans?
JULIAN
I feel I'm locked in a tennis court and people keep serving balls to me and I have to play and I can't compete.
STEPHEN
But you do compete. You've put me in this tennis court.
JULIAN
Look, this isn't flippant; she's captured my heart.
STEPHEN
I think you only exist by hurting. Being hurt... I can talk.
JULIAN
Look, I've got to go. Don't despair.
STEPHEN
Despair? Despair! Despair's okay. It's anxious despair I don't like.
JULIAN
I don't exist for you, Stephen, really. You'd like to blow me out.
STEPHEN
Do you know, we don't know who the other is.
JULIAN
I do. I know who you are.
STEPHEN
But if what you say is true, and I expect it is, you're forgetting I do care! I honestly do!
JULIAN
And me.
STEPHEN
You're forgetting. Try as I can, I'm not as immoral as you are.
JULIAN
Oh, don't moralise, Stephen.
STEPHEN
Sorry. Sorry.
JULIAN
Look, I've got to go. I'm really tired. And I've got to be up. I really have....
I
Don't give Celia my love.
CELIA
[Calling] Are you alright, Julian?
PAUL
What's this, then?
STEPHEN
I'm alright.
PAUL
What's this, then? [Picking up a bottle of pills] What are these? Where did you get these? Okay?
STEPHEN
Terrible.
PAUL
Is it?
STEPHEN
It's terrible. Can I come into your bed?
PAUL
I expect so.
STEPHEN
I'm going to kill him. I'm going to fucking kill him. I'll knife him. Please can I come in with you? Where can I get a shooter?
PAUL
What do you want a shooter for?
STEPHEN
I'm going to shoot him.
PAUL
Oh. Okay. But I don't know where you can get a shooter.
STEPHEN
Someone must know.
PAUL
Nobody I know.
STEPHEN
I'm going to kill him.
PAUL
What is it?
STEPHEN
It's the anger. And the—anger. It's terrible.
PAUL
He takes up with a dislocated Liverpudlian who hit the hippie trail and who talks about Tibet and anarchy. He goes down to West Indian clubs, which he calls shebeens; plays pool in the George Canning. He can play two chords of "The Wild Rover" on his guitar. He has the street wisdom of his mother's housekeeper. Why do you want to kill a figure of fun? He loves black music. Reggae. Ska. Scratch. Hip-hop. He really thinks, somehow, it brings black and white together. It's no different. Jazz. Rhythm 'n blues. Tamia Motown. People have always liked a black man with a banjo.
STEPHEN
Don't be vulgar, Paul.
PAUL
Look. You can't... He may genuinely like the music, right? But these street acquaintances ... The only reparation being made is to himself. And it does no good for him, with his nervous off-accent in a minicab to West Indian drivers who want honky out of the car as soon as possible. They still fucking hate in the same way I do. Look at the drugs. Look at the hypocrisy surrounding drugs. They say they're after the pushers. They only get the middlemen who depend on the Julians. The poor fucking ... But they won't jail Julian.
STEPHEN
You smoke dope, Paul.
PAUL
Yeah, I know.
STEPHEN
Why are you so angry with him?
PAUL
I think perhaps because I'm jealous.
STEPHEN
Why?
PAUL
I think I must hate something he stands for in you. Have you ever seen him spray his yucca? The yucca ... And Shelley ...? Whatever happened to Blake? They used to arrogate poor Blake in my day. Oh, I don't know....
STEPHEN
It's because in the beginning there was no one else in the frame. He knew no one. Because all this street acquaintanceship is so very touching. And because he was alone. Or rather he felt abandoned. He can't tell the difference between being alone and being abandoned.
PAUL
You mean you can't, Stephen.
STEPHEN
It's the pure filament of self-obsession.
PAUL
Come on. He's not worth it.
STEPHEN
What do you mean, he's not worth it? Of course he's not worth it. Who is worth it? Worth it. I know he's not worth it. He knows he's not worth it. And it's dawned on you he's not worth it. Worth it!
PAUL
Look, Steve . . .
STEPHEN
I don't want a suitable love object. I just want revenge on a couple of people, frankly. He's fucking Celia. He's in love with Celia.
PAUL
Everyone's in love with Celia.
STEPHEN
Are you in love with Celia?
PAUL
No.
STEPHEN
You fucked her.
PAUL
I have not.
STEPHEN
What's wrong with Celia? Ring this number. If Celia answers, put the phone down.
PAUL
It's an ansaphone. What does that mean?
STEPHEN
Nothing. He sent her fucking flowers. Ring this number.
PAUL
Christ! Steve ... No answer.
STEPHEN
Oh ... God. Roses. I think I was a very loving child and never grew out of it.
PAUL
Come on. Let's go down.
STEPHEN
No, I'm okay.
NELL
Darling!
PAUL
Do you know what he's doing to himself?
CELIA
No. What do you mean?
PAUL
What do you think I mean?
CELIA
You know Stephen!
PAUL
Stephen? I know Stephen.
CELIA
Look, Paul, I'm sorry; he'll have to put up with it. I didn't mean that. Oh! He's alright, isn't he?
PAUL
Celia. I never thought you were stupid. What is it? You look as if this was the love of your life. Is it? I hope it is.
CELIA
Why?
PAUL
This smug radiance had better be worth it.
CELIA
Why?
PAUL
It's on the cards, I think. It really is. He's going to do something, Celia, only not, apparently, intentionally.
CELIA
But you're keeping an eye on him, aren't you?
PAUL
I never took you for a hard girl either. How is Golden Boy? Have you taught him to play bridge? I hope he's a better partner than you are.
CELIA
Paul. Stephen's, I owe ...
PAUL
Your fucking job to Stephen.
CELIA
But Stephen's. Well, you know Stephen.
PAUL
Look, Celia. What are you saying? What? What? I do know Stephen. What's Golden Boy think he's doing? He's a real beauty, he is. A real fucking sleeping beauty. He's like a dumdum bullet, and what do you mean?... Oh, I'm going.
CELIA
Paul, I'm sorry, Paul. What about these, Paul?
PAUL
I'm leaving them for Golden Boy.
STEPHEN
Hello.
JULIAN
I've come to see you. Is it okay?
STEPHEN
Yeah, yeah. How are you?
JULIAN
I'm alright.
STEPHEN
What's that—FIDELIO! Julian! Where'd you get it?
JULIAN
Fuck off.
STEPHEN
Sorry. Where'd you get it? Is this for me?
JULIAN
No. Yes, it is for you.
STEPHEN
Where did you get it? Did Celia give you this?
JULIAN
Yes.
STEPHEN
Yes. Her last boyfriend was a musician. I suppose the next one will get a copy of the Oxford Book of Romantic Verse. I'm sorry.... I'm sorry.
JULIAN
No, no, no, it's okay.
STEPHEN
Are you staying?
JULIAN
Can I?
STEPHEN
Of course.
JULIAN
For a bit, I'll have to go later. Is it alright?
STEPHEN
Of course.
JULIAN
Stephen, why haven't I seen you?
STEPHEN
Julian!
JULIAN
Why are you laughing? What did I say? What is it?
STEPHEN
It's alright; it's alright.
JULIAN
You know I don't care for her half as much as I care for you.
STEPHEN
This is really fucking awful.
JULIAN
What is?
STEPHEN
It's just I can't bear the thought of someone knowing more about you than me.
JULIAN
She doesn't know more about me than you; nobody knows more about me than you. I don't know more about me than you.
STEPHEN
Why are you doing this?
JULIAN
I don't know.
STEPHEN
There's a pullover of yours in there.
JULIAN
Is there?
STEPHEN
I've been wearing it. Do you mind?
JULIAN
No,
STEPHEN
Because it smells of you. Pathetic, isn't it? Have you seen Fidelio?
JULIAN
No.
STEPHEN
Have you listened to it?
JULIAN
No.
STEPHEN
Have you been to the opera?
JULIAN
Yes.
STEPHEN
What did you see?
JULIAN
Der Rosenkavalier.
STEPHEN
Did you like it?
JULIAN
No.
STEPHEN
Quite right. [Whistles] "Hab mir's gelobt, ihn lieb zu haben auf der richtigen Weis, Daß ich selbst seine Lieb zu einer andern Noch lieb hab! Hab mir freilich nicht gedacht, daß es so bald mir auferlegt sollt werden!"
JULIAN
What's that?
STEPHEN
Rosenkavalier.
JULIAN
What's Fidelio about?
STEPHEN
Well, there's . ..
JULIAN
No. No, no. What's it about?
STEPHEN
It's about freedom and constancy. You should know about that.
JULIAN
What's Der Rosenkavalier about?
STEPHEN
Julian! You've seen it.
JULIAN
I know.
STEPHEN
It's about nothing.
JULIAN
Is it good?
STEPHEN
Very good.
JULIAN
Which is the best? Is Fidelio very good?
STEPHEN
Very, very good.
JULIAN
Yes, I thought it might be. I didn't like Der Rosenkavalier. I don't like the fucking opera. Do you?
STEPHEN
Yes. No. I dunno. I don't go. No.
JULIAN
Is Der Rosenkavalier good?
STEPHEN
Very good.
JULIAN
I don't understand anything.
STEPHEN
Come on.
JULIAN
Stephen.
STEPHEN
You'd better go.
JULIAN
Stephen.
STEPHEN
Shall I call you a cab?
JULIAN
Yes, I'd better go.
STEPHEN
You're such .., There's a towel of yours in there as well, and half a bottle of JoJoba, and the Eucryl smoker's, and a pair of swimming trunks, and a tube of Daktarin, and the African fucking honey, and the Eau du Portugal.
JULIAN
That's okay.
STEPHEN
And a packet of three with one to go.
CELIA
Are you alright?
JULIAN
Fine.
CELIA
What is it?
JULIAN
I'm alright, honestly. You?
CELIA
Not very. Are we going?
JULIAN
Don't you want to?
CELIA
Not really.
JULIAN
Don't let's go then.
CELIA
Nothing. Honestly. Let's stop. Lets stop it.
JULIAN
Something ...
CELIA
You cant accommodate to anybody, can you?
JULIAN
What?
CELIA
Everybody must accommodate to you.
JULIAN
What? Christ! Christ! What? To me? Who's been doing the accommodating if I haven't been doing the accommodating?
CELIA
Alright.
JULIAN
It isn't alright. Oh no, it isn't alright. It isn't alright. Oh no. Everything you want to do, I do. I meet your friends. I go to restaurants with people you like. I go to concerts because you like them. I spend my time here. You haven't even visited my flat.
CELIA
I have.
JULIAN
Once. My friends. All I did was not go to your parents for the weekend. That's all, Celia. It isn't alright.
CELIA
I didn't mind you not coming for the weekend.
JULIAN
You minded.
CELIA
I didn't. I'm perfectly satisfied with my parents. I can't help it if my father's a school inspector and my mother's a teacher. I can't help it if you don't like them.
JULIAN
I don't know ifi like them or if I dislike them, anyway. There's no reason for me to like them.
CELIA
Or dislike them.
JULIAN
I don't. I don't know them. I don't want to know them. All this cosiness. I don't want to see them or visit them or walk the dogs. Any of that nonsense. I don't want to know mummy or daddy. This is enough. Quite enough.
CELIA
Julian!
JULIAN
Quite enough. Quite enough. Quite enough.
STEPHEN
Will I see you later? Oh no.
JULIAN
Why not?
STEPHEN
You've got to have dinner with Celia, haven't you?
JULIAN
That's tomorrow night.
STEPHEN
It isn't.
JULIAN
Isn't it? Where's her note? Christ, it is tonight. Oh God, I'm so tired. I think it's glandular fever. Stephen. Do you think? Listen, do you think I've got glandular fever? She says, can we meet where no one can gawp? Really, who's interested in people gawping? Anyway, I'll have to go, won't I? Perhaps I'll just go for a drink. I'll ring her; we'll just go for a drink. What do you think? I'll have to have a shower.
STEPHEN
Listen. I can't say anything. You go for a drink. I think there's something grotesque about this, anyway.
JULIAN
Isn't this how you do these things?
STEPHEN
I don't know.
JULIAN
Oh Christ, I haven't got any money, and I haven't got my cheque book. Do you think it matters?
STEPHEN
No. Look, you'll have to pay. I've got thirty quid. Do you want it?
JULIAN
Can I have twenty-five?
STEPHEN
What is it?
JULIAN
Nothing.
STEPHEN
What's the matter?
JULIAN
Leave me alone.
STEPHEN
What is it?
JULIAN
I'm in trouble.
STEPHEN
What trouble? Oh God.
JULIAN
What? No.
STEPHEN
What then?
JULIAN
She gave me a lift home, and when we got there, she started crying.
STEPHEN
Why?
JULIAN
I asked her how the cats were.
STEPHEN
How were they? Didn't one of them bite you once?
JULIAN
Yes. Florence.
STEPHEN
Christ.
JULIAN
I made her come in, and we talked for hours and hours and hours and hours till two in the morning. She went home. Then I felt sorry for her and myself and went over there. What am 1 going to do now?
STEPHEN
I don't know, Julian.
JULIAN
She says she fought hard for her independence. Fuck her. I dreamt I was in a desert in America and you deserted me. I suppose you will. Won't you ...?
CELIA
It's when you can't change anything. I've tried. I've not been able to. I've only made it worse. Will you tell him for me that he must or I'll die? How stupid. Will you speak to him? Oh ... will you please?
PAUL
Celia ...
CELIA
No. He's ...
PAUL
Yes. He's not much use to you, is he? Is he?
CELIA
He's left nothing. This for a little love. This for that. And yes ... no. Oh, I hope I never have to see him again. I do. I do. I do. I won't come out. Do you mind?
PAUL
Celia.
CELIA
I must go to work on Monday. I haven't been to work for two weeks. But I can't stay off any longer. I haven't seen anyone. Please, you won't tell him I've spoken to you, will you?
PAUL
Of course I won't. Come on, Celia.
CELIA
No. I'll stay in. Thanks. Thanks.
JULIAN
You know that girl? That tall girl? I think she was flirting with me.
STEPHEN
Don't. Please don't. Don't. By every bloody thing, don't.
JULIAN
Why not? Why not? Can't I?
STEPHEN
Look, she lives with a very nice bloke. Just don't.
JULIAN
What's his name?
STEPHEN
Keith. I've never met him.
JULIAN
She asked me if I was having an affair with you.
STEPHEN
Aye, she would. Are you? That's why she was flirting with you.
JULIAN
Is it? Really, is it? Do you like her?
STEPHEN
I don't really know her.
JULIAN
It's alright. She won't like me; those kind of girls never do. What's she like?
STEPHEN
She's a hockey field Venus. Half good looking, like you. Grew too tall to be a dancer, I shouldn't wonder. They live in Cambridge in one of those big houses on the Chesterton Road, and her aunt was Wittgenstein's doctor's receptionist, or north Oxford and their mother was an actress but gave it up to have nine brutally concerned children. Or she lopes along Chiswick Mall, the daughter of a judge. And gives you pebbles or driftwood for Christmas. Trouble. Take a very long spoon. I bet she was at the Band Aid concert.
JULIAN
She told me there's a very good double bill at the Rio in Dalston. And that restaurant on Newington Green.
STEPHEN
Yes. I suppose the return match'll be at the Ritzy in Brixton.
JULIAN
No. She's...Keith? She's a terrible flirt.
JULIAN
[Reading]
NELL
It's like making love.
JULIAN
Is it?
NELL
Do you want some of this?
JULIAN
Thanks.
NELL
What is it?
JULIAN
I'm restless.
NELL
Oh.
JULIAN
Not with you. I don't know what I'm doing. Work. Everything. I'm a sort of displaced person. I feel like some sort of refugee here.
NELL
How? Come on. Because you were born abroad? Really?
JULIAN
That I suppose. A result of feeling that school was where they called home and home was in Malaya and now I don't know where I am.
NELL
Why don't you go back?
JULIAN
I'd like to. I'd love to.
NELL
I've never been very far ... Elba.
JULIAN
Oh, Malaya ... oh, you should.
NELL
What are you laughing at?
JULIAN
Thinking of here and there.
NELL
Where were you born?
JULIAN
Kuala Lumpur. But mainly I think of the Cameron Highlands house.
NELL
Not a plantation? Really?
JULIAN
Really.
NELL
How very glamorous. I can see how you feel as you do. Though I like where we live. Where I was born, in fact.
JULIAN
Where?
NELL
North. On the borders. There is something utterly strange and beautiful and compelling about border country, I think.... I went to Wales once and we got to somewhere out of Shakespeare... Mortimer's Cross. And I got this feeling, scary. Beautiful. I expected Red Indians. But our borders...
JULIAN
Do you go home?
NELL
I love going home. In spite of ... mainly for the place. The village. The town. Our house and when we're all together, I suppose.
JULIAN
In spite of what? What does your father do?
NELL
He's a doctor. He's a consultant, in fact. Mainly in Newcastle. But sometimes in Edinburgh and even London. But he won't move here. He likes the north and the Scots, though he's very English. We all went to boarding schools in the south, and my brother went to public school here. You must come. My mother likes visitors and us all there. Though I don't like her very much.
JULIAN
Why?
NELL
Well, of course I do. But. What is it about Malaya? Is it like India? How they write about it. Is it like that?
JULIAN
Yes. Longing. But it's everything, the people.
NELL
Did you have an ayah? No, that's India.
JULIAN
Yes, we had an amah. She was called an amah. My favourite had to leave—to go back to her village. It's just everything. The green. England! The green in Malay. I'm sure where you live is beautiful. We used to go to Scotland. But there. Everything. The rain. I stood in the rain once and my parents were rowing inside. I ran off the verandah and into the rain. The rain was just soaking me. English rain is so hateful, somehow. Mean. Untrustworthy. Cold.
NELL
What did your father do before he retired?
JULIAN
Not as romantic as you think but yes, tea. After the war he worked for a company in Penang and then Kuala Lumpur. He met my mother there. They aren't grand, you know. My mother comes from Southampton.
NELL
I'm sure there must be grand people even in Southampton.
JULIAN
He was commissioned in the war. And then after was very hard working and enterprising and clever and competitive.
NELL
Was it his plantation?
JULIAN
No. [Laughs] He worked for a company. Later a huge American multinational company. He ended up chairman of one of their subsidiaries back in Kuala Lumpur. He's loaded. I know he hates it here. More than me. He won't say. He was very big in the emergency. Not back in the army. But I don't know ... being important ... holding civilians together. Of course he thinks things have gone from bad to worse, which of course they have. Do you play mahjong?
NELL
What? No.
JULIAN
My father and mother and their Sussex friends actually play mahjong. He's, oh Christ, it's impossible. He's bright; I know he is. But he's so competitive. He knows the truth. I think he's lost his soul. My parents don't deserve a better chronicler than Somerset Maugham. They really don't.
NELL
Are you like him?
JULIAN
No, I'm not!
NELL
Alright, angel, come on.
JULIAN
I look like my mother. She's pretty despicable, I'm afraid. She's vain and weak and spoiled. Is that bad of me? His temper I have, I suppose. No, I don't. You?
NELL
I can cope with my father, but I hate him for putting up with my mother. I hate her quite passionately, really. Maybe because she'd had this man for years and my father knows. And her daunting competence I hate. I like my sisters and especially my brother, of course.
JULIAN
What's he called?
NELL
Giles.
JULIAN
Do you want a smoke?
NELL
Look, I should go.
JULIAN
Don't go.
NELL
Look, this isn't supposed to be on. I've got to see Keith before he leaves, though I'm fed up with him at the moment, actually.
JULIAN
That's between you and Keith.
NELL
Are you having an affair with Stephen?
JULIAN
You keep asking that. Does it look like I am?
NELL
Look, my brother's gay.
JULIAN
So is mine. Or at least that's what he just told his wife.
NELL
Giles, when he was at public school, I was always jealous of his romances.
JULIAN
Really.
NELL
He was once in love with someone called John Graham, and he, John Graham, threw Giles over for someone called Philip Richards, and Giles was so angry. So angry, he made himself ill, and he took two aspirins and was in the sanitorium for three days. He said it was my mother, and I think it even was my mother. But it wasn't; it was John Graham. And that's how he got John Graham back. And when he, John Graham, left school, he came back during the term and took Giles out in his motorcar. I thought it was incredible. I still do. Exciting.
JULIAN
Not for Philip Richards, I should think. Do you want a smoke? Do you smoke?
NELL
Sometimes.
JULIAN
Have a smoke.
NELL
Okay. I'll ring Keith. Then I'll read something to you.
JULIAN
I'm going out.
STEPHEN
Don't go out. Come on. Sit down. What's the thing about one of your friends that you most like to remember?
PAUL
I don't know.
STEPHEN
I know what it is about you.
PAUL
What?
STEPHEN
In the other house I was sitting on the sofa by the fire, reading Great Expectations, and there was a soft tread on the step and a light tap on the door, and in you came and you said, "Miss Barrett, Miss Barrett, I've come to take you away."
JULIAN
Look, I've got to go out.
STEPHEN
Don't go out.
JULIAN
I'm fucking going out to get some stuff, okay? Okay, Paul?
STEPHEN
Don't. Come on.
PAUL
A thing to hate. The public school as an image of England. They can take the slipper, these boys, but they don't know how to put their dukes up. And instead of going in the army where they belong, they persecute the rest of us.
STEPHEN
Oh, don't, Paul.
PAUL
I was in college with someone who went home at the end of the winter term, and his parents had moved without leaving an address. There are families, and families, Stephen.
STEPHEN
Young people are like unborn babies. It's the fate of each generation to have the young express themselves in different ways. Flappers. Teddy Boys. Flower children. Skinheads. And the old must put up with it. To me they look like unborn babies. Spoiled. I spoiled it. Seeking more. Not accepting the unfinished edge of things. Not letting it drift as it will. And put the effort in when it's needed. But why can't he say...? Why can't he show...?
PAUL
He can't because he's like that. And you'll have to put up with it or ship out.
STEPHEN
What am I to do? I can't just drop him. I don't want to. Shall I give him up?
PAUL
Yes. And what will you do then? You're addicted to him. It's an addiction.
STEPHEN
What do you know about Nell?
PAUL
When she left school, she did something first. She didn't go to Cambridge straightaway, I know. She wouldn't, I think. What was it? I don't think it was the VSO.
STEPHEN
I bet it was VSO.
PAUL
Nor the National Youth Theatre.
STEPHEN
It must have been one or the other. It must have been. I bet she played Helena. God, Vanessa Redgrave's got a lot to answer for, except perhaps her politics. Have you ever seen her? She's like a less subtly violent Nell. I bet. Nell's shadowly concerned.
PAUL
I think she's fantastic. She burns me.
STEPHEN
Who, Nell?
PAUL
No. Nell ... Well ... She has, Stephen, in her time.
STEPHEN
But she isn't twenty-four anymore.
PAUL
I'd give her one.
STEPHEN
You've given her one.
PAUL
How was it at the weekend?
STEPHEN
Home?
PAUL
Yeah. Your mother okay?
STEPHEN
No. I think I'm too much bother for her now. I think my concern makes her even more agitated.
PAUL
Is she in for long this time?
STEPHEN
I don't know. She just sits there and suddenly her eyes light up. I seem inevitably to be caught up in a passionate and romantic attachment for someone who needs you but doesn't want you. It's like an article in one of your magazines down there. The children on YOP schemes. Young boys joining the army. Brothers and brothers-in-law in and out of work. We went over to Cardiff for a meal. My younger sister, Kath, she's like a sansculotte. We had to wait for a taxi for hours because she wouldn't go with the firm that took the blacklegs to Merthyr Vale. She says they're killers by implication.
PAUL
Aren't they?
STEPHEN
My father says—"I tell you, Stephen, I'm glad I'm not a young man. It's worse than the thirties. I tell you, Stephen, in 1926 when I was a shop steward." I never knew he was a shop steward; he never told me he was a shop steward. "We couldn't get two fellers to come out on strike, and we warned them, and when we went back, the manager sacked them." He could have only been twenty-four in '26. "You in work, Stephen? How's work? When you going back?"
PAUL
Yeah, Neurotic symptoms in the upper working class. Routledge Kegan Paul. It comes to something when your happiest times were when your mother went to put flowers on her father's grave. Playing in the long grass. Playing and watching. Pleasant like another child would watch its mother knitting. No tears. Sunny day. Come here. There we are. Beautiful grasses. Secretly I think my father would be relieved if I voted Tory. I think it would be proof that I'd done something. But we seemed to have moved class without breaking faith with chaos.
STEPHEN
I don't know about my father—if I voted Tory, it would be the only thing that would bring my mother out of the mental hospital. There was this play and a man on a park bench and he said, "I feel I haven't been part of life." Just like The Cherry Orchard. Something like that. Have you been part of life?
PAUL
I don't know what that means.
STEPHEN
It goes through one, I suppose, in its own way. If we will let life live us instead of being afraid or thinking other lives should be our lives. It's our own life we must live.
T
30, winter. That sigh from her. That sigh. That snore from him.
JULIAN
Hello.
STEPHEN
Alright?
JULIAN
Yeah. Do you want some of this, Paul?
PAUL
Aye.
STEPHEN
What is it?
JULIAN
Nothing.
STEPHEN
Fuck it, Julian. You were all over me half an hour ago. What is it?
JULIAN
You're the last person I should tell.
STEPHEN
Then if I'm the last person you should tell, why are you pulling this? When you look like this, you're either dying or angry or frightened.
JULIAN
Well, if I look like this, why don't you take the hint and leave me alone?
STEPHEN
Alright.
JULIAN
I'm fucking furious.
STEPHEN
Why?
JULIAN
I can't, Stephen.
STEPHEN
Oh Christ, why am I putting myself through this? I don't know what to do—is it a test? What is it? You make me feel nothing. I'm nothing. I'm so ashamed of this. Half an hour ago ... This is wrong. Being with you makes me feel like a woman with none of the compensations, and I don't like it. This being controlled by a boy. Nobody can win with you, can they?
JULIAN
I'm not competing.
STEPHEN
You say I'm in competition with you. That's because if somebody puts an experience of theirs up against yours, then you think it somehow robs you. I'm not trying to. At least I don't think I am. Oh God.
JULIAN
I asked her out and at the last minute she changed her mind.
STEPHEN
Who? Oh God.
JULIAN
She said she had to see Keith. Why did she do that?
STEPHEN
Well, mm. Hang on. [Moves away, hand to his mouth] It's alright. Oh, Julian. They do live together.
JULIAN
Sometimes.
STEPHEN
Well, I don't know. This is like being under the guillotine.
JULIAN
Ah. Fuck it. I'm fed up with this. Nothing gonna come of this. It's alright, you're alright, we're alright. I'm going to ring her and tell her to fuck off. Oh, she won't be there.
STEPHEN
Leave a message on her ansaphone.
JULIAN
She hasn't got an ansaphone.
STEPHEN
Of course she's got an ansaphone. All your girlfriends have ansaphones. They're like iron lungs to them. What colour are her eyes?
JULIAN
Er...
STEPHEN
What colour are my eyes? Don't look.
JULIAN
Grey. I can talk about her mouth if you like.
STEPHEN
I always knew you thought a woman's place was on her knees with a mouthful of cock.
JULIAN
Stephen.
STEPHEN
Julian.
JULIAN
I wish I'd never met her. But I like her. She likes you.
STEPHEN
Thanks.
JULIAN
Do you like her?
STEPHEN
I don't really know her. I can see why you like her.
JULIAN
She's kind.
STEPHEN
You mean she's classier than Celia. She won't make you feel so parvenu.
JULIAN
Is she better than me?
STEPHEN
Oh! No.
JULIAN
Ah, fuck her.
STEPHEN
It's alright.
JULIAN
Stephen, is she better looking than me?
STEPHEN
What?
JULIAN
It's alright.
STEPHEN
It's alright. Sick. Here, this must be Nell's brooch. She left it in the bathroom.
JULIAN
No no no. Here. [Giving her some flowers] Don't.
NELL
Thanks! Oh ... they're beautiful.
JULIAN
Do you love me?
NELL
What?
JULIAN
I do.
NELL
They're beautiful! Do you love me?
JULIAN
With all my heart. You?
NELL
"I love you with so much of my heart that I have nothing left to give."
JULIAN
Where's that from?
NELL
Aha! Got you! These really are beautiful. You have one.
JULIAN
I can't carry a rose.
NELL
Come on.
JULIAN
No.
NELL
Come on.
JULIAN
No.
NELL
Oh.
JULIAN
Oh. What is it?
NELL
I suppose we shouldn't....
JULIAN
No. Well, people are in everything, aren't they? Have you had a holiday?
NELL
Yes.
JULIAN
I haven't.
NELL
Oh, poor boy.
JULIAN
Don't.
NELL
Come on. Oh!
JULIAN
What? What is it?
NELL
Don't. Keith's coming back. And then he's coming to town to live properly.
JULIAN
That isn't a proper thing to discuss.
NELL
Isn't it? Must we only discuss what you want to discuss?
JULIAN
No. Don't be angry.
NELL
Anyway, things will have to take their course.
JULIAN
I'll wait, you know, for as long as it takes.
NELL
Are we going to lunch?
JULIAN
Yes. What... what are you doing this afternoon?
NELL
Work.
JULIAN
I'm damn well taking the afternoon off.
NELL
That's rather irresponsible.
JULIAN
Can you take the afternoon off?
NELL
I can ... but I won't.
JULIAN
Come on. Come on.
NELL
Haven't you had a holiday, really?
JULIAN
No. Where did you go?
NELL
We went to Spain. Fantastic. What is it? Well, we did go. Where ... where are you going?
JULIAN
Oh. The Maldives or ... I want to go to Italy. I was going with Stephen. He won't come.
NELL
When?
JULIAN
In a couple of weeks. I'm not going alone. I'm not going without you. Will you come?
NELL
Alright.
JULIAN
Will you? Will you? I'll get the tickets. I'll do the hotel. I know, I'll hire a car.
NELL
Where?
JULIAN
We'll fly to Pisa and drive to the bay of Viareggio. It'll be great.... [Pause] What about...?
NELL
I'll handle that. And Stephen?
JULIAN
I've told you. Will you take the afternoon off?
NELL
Wear this and I might.
PAUL
Coming for a drink?
STEPHEN
Aye. Okay.
PAUL
Do you want to wait for Boy Blue?
STEPHEN
No.
PAUL
We'll wait.
STEPHEN
No.
PAUL
We'll wait.
STEPHEN
No.
PAUL
We don't have to wait.
STEPHEN
We're going for a drink.
JULIAN
No, I've got to pack.
STEPHEN
Come for a pint.
JULIAN
No. A pint. Oh no. Fuck it.
STEPHEN
What is it?
JULIAN
I've lost my driving licence. [Violently] I've got an international bloody driver's licence, and I don't know where it is!
PAUL
I'm going for a drink then, okay?
STEPHEN
Hang on. Well, where can it be?
JULIAN
I don't know.
PAUL
See you in the pub.
STEPHEN
Hang on,Paul.
JULIAN
I'll ring home; it may be there.
PAUL
So long.
STEPHEN
Hang on. It'll be there.
PAUL
I'm going. [Exits]
STEPHEN
Paul!
JULIAN
I don't want to go.
STEPHEN
It'll be great. You'll meet people.
JULIAN
Here. [Gives him the bag]
STEPHEN
What's...!
JULIAN
You wanted it. [Takes out a shirt]
STEPHEN
What? Julian, the money.
JULIAN
Do you like it? Do you? Do you really like it?
STEPHEN
It's the most expensive shirt I've ever had.
JULIAN
Do you really like it? Do you? Is it okay?
STEPHEN
Great. I'll put it on.
JULIAN
Oh Christ. I've got to go. I've got to go home for the weekend and then Gatwick on Monday. Oh God.
STEPHEN
It'll be alright. Take them something.
JULIAN
I've got something.
STEPHEN
And keep your mouth shut.
JULIAN
Okay.
STEPHEN
Hear me.
JULIAN
Yeah.
STEPHEN
Do you hear me?
JULIAN
Alright. I'll ring you from the airport before the flight takes off.
STEPHEN
You won't, Julian.
JULIAN
I will.
STEPHEN
How can you?
JULIAN
I'll ring you.
STEPHEN
Will you?
JULIAN
I promise. I've got to go, okay?
STEPHEN
Have a nice time.
JULIAN
Shouldn't think so.
STEPHEN
You will.
JULIAN
Do you really like the shirt?
STEPHEN
[Offstage] He won't be long.
CELIA
Fine.
STEPHEN
[Offstage] He shouldn't be long.
CELIA
That's fine.
STEPHEN
He's usually in by now. Is that him? [Calling] Paul! No.
CELIA
Great. I've been promoted.
STEPHEN
Really?
CELIA
Yes.
STEPHEN
Paul didn't say.
CELIA
Paul doesn't know. That's partly why I came round.
STEPHEN
I am well. More?
CELIA
No. Thanks. No. Haven't finished this.
STEPHEN
This is terrible tea.
CELIA
Do you read The Face?
STEPHEN
No, I don't read The Face. This tea is really awful. Don't finish it. I'll make some more.
CELIA
No. Who's that?
STEPHEN
[Listening] Paul.
PAUL
Yeah.
STEPHEN
Where have you been?
PAUL
What do you mean, where have I been? To work is where I have been. Hello stranger. Okay?
CELIA
Hello.
STEPHEN
She's been promoted.
PAUL
Have you? I'll get a cup.
STEPHEN
No. Put the kettle on. This is awful. The water didn't boil.
PAUL
Okay.
STEPHEN
No, I'll do it.
CELIA
Thank God you've come. I'll have to go.
PAUL
Why?
CELIA
Well.
PAUL
Julian? He's in Italy.
CELIA
Oh. With whom?
PAUL
Himself. Do you care?
CELIA
I don't. I don't, Paul. Honestly I don't.
PAUL
Anyone new? Going out with anyone?
CELIA
Paul. Yes, I am actually.
PAUL
Really, Celia. Your public secrecy. I'm glad about the job.
CELIA
Yes.
STEPHEN
[Offstage] I won't be long.
CELIA
Look. I'll have to go. I just wanted to tell you.
STEPHEN
I made proper tea.
PAUL
This domesticity's a bit of a change.
STEPHEN
Guests.
CELIA
None for me. I'm off.
STEPHEN
Oh. Sure?
CELIA
Yes. Bye. I'll let myself out.
PAUL
No.
CELIA
Really. Bye.
STEPHEN
Do you want some tea?
PAUL
Yeah.
STEPHEN
Pour it then, will you? I don't want any.
JULIAN
Don't let's go on. It was awful really.
STEPHEN
Come on. You look great. Was it really awful? No girls? No girls, Julian? What about the grove of Catullus?
JULIAN
Look, Stephen. Look, I can't. It just makes me nervous.
STEPHEN
Okay. You know you said you'd ring from the airport.
JULIAN
Oh my God. When I got back? I didn't.
STEPHEN
When you left.
JULIAN
Did I? Oh ...
STEPHEN
Have you rung home?
JULIAN
No. I haven't rung home.
STEPHEN
Have you rung anyone?
JULIAN
Do you mean Nell? Why should I ring Nell? Why shouldn't I ring Nell?
STEPHEN
I don't know. Tell us about Italy, Julian.
JULIAN
You know I'm not good with women. She's a friend. Just a friend. Can't I have a friend?
STEPHEN
Why not? I've got a friend. Thank God for a friend. Thank God for Paul!
JULIAN
Is he your best friend? Aren't I your best friend? I thought I was your best friend. Nell. I can't act normally as far as she's concerned. She's afraid she's going to hurt you. Celia said you have to get on with it.
STEPHEN
Infatuation.
JULIAN
What?
STEPHEN
Look it up. Go on; look it up. You don't need to look it up. I looked it up. It doesn't help. "Nativity once in the main of light crawls to maturity." You're like the main of light. Angel. Isn't that what she calls you? Christ, Nell. "While you've a Lucifer to light your fag, smile boys that's the style."
JULIAN
You're the most restrictive person I've ever met. She calls me that. Yes. Why not?
STEPHEN
Because, Golden Boy, it's so obvious.
JULIAN
I've enough crowding inside my head. I've enough criticising myself. I don't need you crowding and criticising me. Don't say, look at that, look at that, listen to this. You're like, you're like ... You're endlessly trying to describe me,
STEPHEN
This is going to end up with one of us dead.
JULIAN
You'll have friends if anything bad happens.
STEPHEN
If you had a bit more character, you'd have ended up a born-again Christian. I used to love you more than I hated you. Now I hate you. I hate you. Do you know I hate you? I've got to go through with this to learn never to do it again. Never. Never to let it happen to me again. I don't know what to do. You'll have to do something. I'm tired after work and I don't know what to do and it's all my fault; it's so humiliating. Why do I seem to be just letting this humiliation happen? I could kill you. Better than being dead. [Pause] You really didn't like anything but the swimming and the food at all. Didn't you go into a church?
JULIAN
Yes, we went into a church....
STEPHEN
What is it? What's the matter, Julian?
JULIAN
Nothing.
STEPHEN
Was she Italian?
JULIAN
I'll kill you if you go on about that holiday.
STEPHEN
You'd be doing me the greatest of favours.
JULIAN
Oh, come on. You can't say that. Oh Christ. Don't say that.
STEPHEN
Well. Where's the postcard?
JULIAN
Would you like it? I didn't post it.
STEPHEN
But there's nothing on it.
JULIAN
I was lying.
STEPHEN
I don't care. Write on it now.
STEPHEN
There we are. Now I've got it.
JULIAN
There was your card waiting. When I got in. Welcome home.
STEPHEN
Look, don't make me feel bad for sending you a postcard! Because you didn't send me a postcard.
STEPHEN
I wonder if he's taken her to lunch in Holland Park.
PAUL
Where in Holland Park?
STEPHEN
A bar. Sounds like one of his girlfriends.
PAUL
I know.
STEPHEN
Have you been there?
PAUL
No. What's it like?
STEPHEN
It's like Bluebeard's castle.
PAUL
What?
STEPHEN
I mean, he takes all his serious attempts there. I spent a whole day there once.
PAUL
What's it like?
STEPHEN
It's like a cross between a detoxicated opium den and the copper kettle. Moorish screens. Brass tables. Sofas. Dying palms. A dozing cat. Bits of church furniture. Ecclesiastical bric-a-brac. Bentwood chairs. Jacobean beams. Mock Persian carpets stapled to the back of pews. Full of boys like him and girls like Nell.
PAUL
How do you know he's taken her there?
STEPHEN
I know. The book matches'll turn up. You see I know what things are going to be like. He didn't ring me. So I rang him at 2
PAUL
In the morning?
STEPHEN
Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, he said. I put the phone down. Then later I made a transfer charge call. So he'd think I was in a phone box. I heard him put the phone down. Then I got dressed and went out. It had been raining. I was cold. I went out to make a call from a phone box. So he could hear that sound, that infuriating sound before the money is inserted. And then let him know it was me and then put the phone down. But I didn't believe that the phone box would be out of order as I had imagined. Would be broken, and the next, and the next street. And that I would be walking the streets in the wet until 5
PAUL
I don't know.
STEPHEN
Hello.
JULIAN
Can I walk down with you?
STEPHEN
Yeah. Yeah,
JULIAN
It's nice to see you.
STEPHEN
Mmm ...
JULIAN
It is. You don't know how nice it is.
STEPHEN
Don't, please. I can't. Please.
JULIAN
You haven't seen me for four weeks. It's nice to see you.
STEPHEN
Don't, Julian.
STEPHEN
What's the matter?
JULIAN
I can't bear it.
STEPHEN
What?
JULIAN
She won't see me now. I can't bear it, Stephen. Don't, someone'll see.
STEPHEN
What does that matter?
JULIAN
She won't see me.
STEPHEN
Has she gone back to Dobbin?
JULIAN
Mm ... Keith. I think so. We did go to Italy together.
STEPHEN
Ha! What? Ha!
JULIAN
You knew.
STEPHEN
I didn't know.
JULIAN
You did know.
STEPHEN
I really didn't know.
JULIAN
You did know,
STEPHEN
I really didn't know. I know now, though. It doesn't matter. [Pause] That was a dirty bloody trick, you know.
JULIAN
What could I do?
STEPHEN
Not go.
JULIAN
How could I not?
STEPHEN
I bet the first coat you ever wore was reversible.
JULIAN
Don't. I don't think I can bear it, Stephen.
STEPHEN
Yes. It must be unbearable. Come on. Come on.
JULIAN
No.
STEPHEN
Why do I want this abasement?
JULIAN
I don't know. You tell me. I don't want it.
STEPHEN
What?
JULIAN
What you said.
STEPHEN
It's the thought of your prostituting intimacies. "With all my heart." I can hear you say it. Rerunning conversations you've had with me. Do you know what it feels like to know a year of your life is being spunked over someone else on the beach at Lerici?
JULIAN
Have I done this to punish myself?
STEPHEN
You mean, like a copycat murder? I dunno. I should think so.... I still can't help loving the idea of you. The idea of something real in you. That was recently there in you. That is in you. Come on.
STEPHEN
[Offering JULIAN a drink] Here.
JULIAN
No.
STEPHEN
Go on.
JULIAN
No.
STEPHEN
Well, why did you corne round?
JULIAN
I don't know. Is it late?
STEPHEN
Must be.
JULIAN
How late?
STEPHEN
Three...
JULIAN
This is just a bundle of misery. Why is she doing it? Is she confused? Is she wicked? Fucking me over—like I've fucked you over. You can feel satisfied now.
STEPHEN
No. I don't feel satisfied. I'm apprehensive. Yes. Of you. Again. But if you start anything—I warn you—I'll join straight in. You've taken all my sexuality and wasted it in ... Nell. She's had me through you.
JULIAN
I can't bear it.
STEPHEN
Drink this, then. Let's go to sleep.
JULIAN
No. No.
STEPHEN
You just reject everything I have to offer. The drink. The blanket. I don't do for you. And you have to reject even these comforts. You don't give anything. I only take by giving and you can't even take this. I can't get her for you. I can't go on being punished for this. Ring her. Punish her. Ring bloody Keith. Give him a basinful. Drink this.
JULIAN
No. I'm going home. Thanks. I'm going to blow myself away. Perhaps that will satisfy everyone.
NELL
Angel.
JULIAN
I came hoping to see Keith, actually. Actually.
NELL
Did you? Why should you want to see Keith?
JULIAN
Because I did. Alright?
NELL
If you try to see Keith, I'll never see you or speak to you again. Ever. Do you understand?
JULIAN
Why are you doing this?
NELL
What, doing what?
JULIAN
Why did you ring me?
NELL
Because I wanted to see you. I missed you.
JULIAN
Did you?
NELL
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have then.
JULIAN
No. No. No. Listen, Nell. Listen.
NELL
Yes.
JULIAN
Listen, Nell. If you weren't with Keith, who would you be with?
NELL
Oh dear. Don't be silly. You know.
JULIAN
I don't know.
NELL
You do.
JULIAN
Honestly. Really. Really?... Please.
NELL
You know I can't.
JULIAN
But it's over between you and Keith.
NELL
Is it?
JULIAN
I know it is. It can't be going to go on forever. Now now.
NELL
No. I can't see it lasting forever. But you know ... I love Keith.
JULIAN
Stop it. Stop it.
NELL
But you must know that I do.
JULIAN
I don't want to hear.
NELL
Well, don't.
JULIAN
And what about me?
NELL
And you. And you.
JULIAN
Please. I'll do anything. I'll wait.
JULIAN
And what...
NELL
Angel.
JULIAN
I will. I'll wait.
NELL
Would you?
JULIAN
I will. I've said I will. I'll wait until it's finished. You told me it was finished between you and Keith,
NELL
When did I say that?
JULIAN
In Italy, virtually... I'd just...
NELL
What?
JULIAN
I'd like to . . . again. I'd like to see your face change because of me. I saw it light up because of me. At the door. I just want to have that effect on you again. That's all. I just want to fuck you to see you change. Your eyes hollow and your skin and your mouth. Please, Nell.
NELL
Look, Keith's coming back tomorrow.
JULIAN
I don't care. Let me stay the night. Please.
NELL
No.
JULIAN
Then why did you ring? Are you mad or what?
NELL
And if things are different between him and me, it's because of... this.
JULIAN
What?
NELL
Look, you'll have to go.
JULIAN
No.
NELL
Julian.
JULIAN
No.
NELL
Julian.
JULIAN
No.
NELL
Alright. Alright.
NELL
They call it an abortion. It's an abortion. My mother calls it an infection. A miscarriage is what it is usually known by. But it's a spontaneous abortion. I would have had a termination anyway. I don't want a baby. Anyway, I think probably I've got a slim chance, so they say. I suffer from cervical incompetence. I've got to have it done. I'm bleeding.
PAUL
Nell.
NELL
I'm strong, you know.
PAUL
Are you? Where's Keith?
NELL
He's coming down. He's been very kind. He's coming with me.
PAUL
Julian?
NELL
He doesn't know.... Yes, I suppose it could be. What about Julian?
STEPHEN
Tell me what to do, he said. Speak to her. I'll write. Don't write, speak. I rang her girlfriend.
PAUL
Who?
STEPHEN
She says she never gave him any reason to hope. I can't understand what's going on in her mind. But I suppose third parties don't count in these matters. He spoke to her. Then rang asking me for a drink. When I arrived. He was . . . they were at the other end of the bar with that look of relief on his face that is his main reason for relating to people at all. I, de trop clearly. I went knowing he'd ring at 11
PAUL
She wants the best of both worlds. Isn't that what we all want?
STEPHEN
Really.
PAUL
Stephen, don't be such a kid. For Nell it's like the 2
STEPHEN
I think she says things—so he says—like "If we're fated to be together, we will be. No matter what happens, I'll always love you." Ghastly things like that.
PAUL
She's trying to draw it to a close.
STEPHEN
Why?
PAUL
Well, she does owe Keith. And she does love him. And it must be faced, Stephen, that Keith must reach those parts of Nell that Julian doesn't get to.
STEPHEN
They're getting a joint mortgage. Nell and Keith.
PAUL
No, they're not. A joint mortgage is the fashionable way of saying, I do.
PAUL
"Angel, the time has come...." I don't want to read this.
JULIAN
Go on. Please. I don't know what to do, Paul, When I opened it and read "The time has come" I thought.
PAUL
I could see you might. I really don't want to read it, Julian.
JULIAN
I've told her I'll wait. Is she a bitch? Is she? Look, Paul, you know her. Tell me. Read it.
PAUL
"I've never hurt so much ...! No one has made me hurt so much!" Does she accept all the blame?
JULIAN
Yes.
PAUL
[Laughs] Yes. "I'm sorry. My fault. No blame." She certainly has a flowing pen.... Ah ...
JULIAN
What?
PAUL
"I only hope I have the strength of will not to see you again."
JULIAN
Yes. But not... it was mine. I know it.
PAUL
How do you know?
JULIAN
Paul. You know. Because one knows.
PAUL
Does one?
JULIAN
Yes.
PAUL
Have you shown this to anyone else? Have you shown this to Stephen?
JULIAN
Yes.
PAUL
You've shown this to Stephen! Did he know about... before this?
JULIAN
Yes. What am I going to do, Paul?
PAUL
What's the point of saying things like if you don't watch out, you're going to get into trouble one day. Nell I know about. There's nothing to be said for Nell. Nell's what used to be called a free spirit. She's like Gwendolyn Harleth as seen by Rebecca West in a book which Virago found too dull to republish, "Was she beautiful, or not beautiful?" It's Nell spelt with a K.
JULIAN
What do you know about Nell?
PAUL
You know there isn't any ownership involved. I know a lot about Nell. I even like Nell. I can still say I like her. I do. I have, and I do, and Stephen doesn't know, and we have since you met, and we have since you got back from Italy. But that's between me and Nell. Why didn't you keep this between you and Nell? What's Stephen done to you? He isn't your father, you know. You're going to get yourself into trouble. You are sometime. It's no good saying anything to Nell. She's degenerate as far as personal feelings go.
JULIAN
I'm in purgatory. It lifts momentarily, and then I wonder, why doesn't she ring? Then I think about Stephen.... I know it was mine. I know. Dad. I hate Stephen. I'll ring him; he'll understand. Why doesn't he leave me alone? How could she do it? I'm going to ring her. I rang her. Ansaphone, ansaphone. She encompasses me. Why? She loves me. Why? Stephen. Why? Stephen. I rang him. I've got to go to bed, I say. Why? He rings back. I can't take him. I don't say anything. Why has she done this? I hate her. Dad. I hate him so much. I asked Stephen, should I buy her flowers. I'm wrecked. Oh please, where is she? She's fucked me. And I'm in trouble with Stephen. Stephen. Why doesn't he leave me alone? I need to talk to him. He pisses me off. I'm not ringing Dad. I do hate him. Stephen's so fucking selfish. The rubbish he talks. I'm not seeing him. Fuck him. If he's angry, good. I'm fucking angry. Really fucking angry. Where is she? Why has she done this? Shall I ring her? I really hate her. Fuck them. I'm in torment. Where is she? I'm not ringing Stephen. What'll he do? Fuck him. Dad. I've put a message on her machine. I can't cope. I can't live without her. I hate her. I hate Stephen. Dad. I really do hate.
STEPHEN
No.
JULIAN
What?
STEPHEN
She isn't better. She isn't more beautiful. She isn't cleverer. She isn't— than you. You're fighting her for possession of yourself.
JULIAN
Yeah? I saw two people in the street just now kissing, flirting, laughing. An ugly young man and a young woman looking much older than their age. She without teeth—he with bad teeth. Unkempt, dirty, drunk. Like children. Oblivious to everyone else. Why them? I've got nobody. Look, everyone is married. I'm losing her and you. Why do people tell you things and then not help you? I know she wants me really. I know.
STEPHEN
Oh, my dear, shall we never be able to ... Shall you always be the thing you're ... Shall you not want me? Shall we always be? Oh, my dear, what a god-awful pity, eh? That people suited and yet not suited. In rebellion. Struggling. You're like one's child. I can't desert you. This amidst all the welter of hate, envy, nerves, frustration. People will say you're very silly and spoilt—but they won't have seen the glimpses, will they? They won't. They'll perceive the charm. The looks. But they won't have seen you look ugly or have seen you when you've squeezed a few tears out. Or how bright you are or how painful your self-knowledge is. We colluded in a fantasy. We are colluding in a fantasy.
JULIAN
She wants me. I know she does, really. But she's too scared to leave him.
STEPHEN
I'm like a dog scratching at the door.
JULIAN
She is. She's ...
STEPHEN
I know she hasn't finished with you yet. I'm not certain you can honestly say you're finished with her. What if she arrives with her suitcases?
JULIAN
I'd be glad of the opportunity to shut the door.
STEPHEN
You wouldn't.
JULIAN
What do you know what I'll do? Why do you think you know everything about me? What do you want?
STEPHEN
Ownership of you is what I want, alright? Okay? Does that suit you? You want to say it, too—say it to someone as mediocre as you are. Someone you think of as really mediocre, really. "Is she better than me?"—You don't mean it. You think she's mediocre, which I don't think of you really, you fucking, fucking bastard. I don't think you even think that about her. Nell. Do you? Yours is not as unhinged an obsession, is it? It's much more acceptable. But you still want to say it—so you can say, I've suffered, too. I've been fucked over; she's fucked me over. You're storing up things she's never imagined, aren't you? To say to her eventually. But you want her to fuck you over so you can say, I've paid. I deserve worse in most instances, but in this one I've paid for the others. And when and if she says it's over again, I'll be there. You've got right on your side, haven't you, really? With all your pretence and free thinking, you're right, you're right. The legacy of romanticism ... What Lady Caroline Lamb said about Byron has lent glamour to all the cheap irresponsibilities of people like you and Nell ever since, without acknowledgement that Byron actually produced something at least as substantial as all the misery he must have caused. But you're so right. So right. But even mad, red, rich, dead, not very cred Shelley wasn't right on about everything. The avoidances in "The Symposium"—what about them? Atheism, freedom, feminism, free love—up to a point. But there was something left to answer, and there was no one living whose ideas he could colonise in that respect. What about the boy at Syon House? The master at Eton? Although even after having written the coldest-hearted poem any man could have written to his wife, he at least saved her from dying from a miscarriage. Something you would be too doped out or preoccupied to cope with. What about Hogg and Trewlawney and Williams? I think it was a drowning of convenience. I think there was something irreconcilable. You know there's nothing intrinsically special about you. You haven't earned this attitude by anything you've done—except swim the mile. Your attitude is a result of money spent on your quite inadequate education and your inability to jump class with any grace. In spite of the dope and the street credibility, your mind is essentially suburban. Nuclear fallout. I love it. It's the only classless thing there is. Do you know I don't know whether or not anything of what I've been saying has any basis in truth at all? They were true words when I spoke them. Or the feelings underpinning them were true. There was feeling. But what I was saying. The opinions, the rationalisations, I think they were just ways of trying to say something else really. I don't think what I'm saying now is ... I think it's genuine enough information. But lies. I think. Not de liberate—don't have the words—or am forbidden them. How can one just keep saying, I love you or I need you or I love you? Over and over. You'd be bored. One has to say other things when one wants not to speak at all, but to say please or help or come or love or please or cry. Over and over and over.
JULIAN
Stephen. Do you remember once inviting me to tell you to fuck off? Fuck off. Just fuck off.
JULIAN
Christ. Stephen. Stephen.
STEPHEN
Don't move. Pauli Paul! Don't move.
PAUL
Stephen.
STEPHEN
He's okay; it's okay. Don't you move. It's okay. Now see this. If I wanted to, I could scar you in the only way that would matter to you. Look at me. I'm your mirror for the moment. Look at yourself. I could. It's alright. I'm not goinj to. Here, Paul.
PAUL
Stephen.
STEPHEN
He can't be loved. He won't be loved. Will you? You see, he won't be loved. You won't.
PAUL
Stephen.
STEPHEN
No. [To JULIAN] Listen.
DAVID
[Voice only] A star fell on Albania. I saw it. Just a few minutes ago. And across the dark Ionian Sea, riding a cool breeze from the Levant, the heavens dance. The moon, burnt orange, shines like an illuminated teardrop. [Pause]
MRS
Waiting! I'm waiting. Hello. I'm waiting!
DAVID
David.
MRS
Now that is a fine hotel. The King David, in Jerusalem. Are you Jewish?
DAVID
Yes.
MRS
Lordy. An artist and a Jew. I do hope you're homosexual as well; they all three seem to complement each other, don't they? I, of course, didn't grow up with any Jews, not in Mississippi. I met them later, a few, on my travels. Where are those siblings? Nikos? Yannis! Will you take my photograph? I long to have my photograph taken. At my dinner table. Perhaps L. Durrell has left his spirit at the table. Perhaps it will materialize on film. Oh—please—will you?
DAVID
Well... I'm not very...
MRS
It will be an adventure, won't it? I did have my photograph taken in Calcutta once. I had just purchased a camera. I thought my children should have a record of my travels. I asked a sweet little beggar to take my picture. I paid him, of course—he must have been terribly hungry, and he had a stoop, just like yours, and only two fingers, one on each hand, which made it difficult to hold the camera, but marvel of marvels, he focused the thing and clicked it, too, and then smiled the most wonderful smile and ran off with the camera. I tried chasing him, but I think his two fingers gave him extra speed. It always helps to travel light. That, of course, was before I realized my children were not interested in seeing photographs. I wonder if he still has the camera? I have wondered, in the clear light of retrospect, you understand, if he was a leper. I've always had a morbid fear of lepers. Now where would a leper get a roll of film developed? I won't say that question has haunted me, but I have wondered... . I think it's fair to say his stoop was a permanent stance. So you will—won't you—take my photograph? Please say yes.
DAVID
Well... [Smiles] Yes.
MRS
Thank you. Now, if only I can get breakfast. You seem to have yours. [She rings the bell again.] I must confess, the bell is hopeless. Never gets me anything. Still... [She rings it again, vigorously.] Waiting! I'm waiting. Sweet Jesus, I'm waiting!
DAVID
[Voice only] I met an amazing woman this morning. On the veranda, waiting for breakfast. Her name is Mrs. Honey and she is from Mississippi and she travels all over the world and she never stops talking and I promised to take her photograph. Now why did I do that? I'm so stupid. I am stupid. And lonely. And sad. And confused and ugly and desperate. Why am I here? [His voice fades off.]
MRS
I feel like I'm under water. Floating. Not real. In a different time. [She opens her eyes.] That camera—my husband, the dentist, had one just like it. Many years ago. Is it an antique?
DAVID
I don't know. It takes the best...
MRS
I can't hear you. [She closes her eyes again.]
DAVID
It takes the best ...
NIKOS
A photographic session?
MRS
Nikos! Yes—indeed. You have a distinguished guest. A famous photographer.
DAVID
[Embarrassed] No, I'm just...
NIKOS
We have many distinguished guests here. This is the finest inn on this part of the island. It was very kind of you to give up your table for Mr. Durrell.
MRS
Well—he is an artist. Artists make things grow.
NIKOS
[Losing at solitaire] Son-of-a-bitch!
MRS
Nikos, you're in the light. Surely he's in the light.
DAVID
No. It's fine.
NIKOS
I am in the way?
DAVID
No.
MRS
Of course you're in the way. Nikos went to Oxford.
DAVID
Really?
MRS
I find, in general, that if you've been to Oxford, you're in the way. Of course, I can't imagine why he and his invisible brother run a hotel in such an insignificant village. Can you? Speak up, child.
DAVID
Well, I don't...
NIKOS
Now, my dear Mrs. Honey—I must ask you for another favour. [He hits his cards.] Bloody hell.
MRS
You play solitaire with such passion.
NIKOS
It is not a sad game, not a lonely game, Mrs. Honey. Not for a Greek.
DAVID
Now!
MRS
What?
DAVID
There.
MRS
Oh. I had my picture took.
DAVID
[Removing the frame] I liked the look on your ...
MRS
Imperious?
DAVID
Yes.
NIKOS
Another favour. [To his cards] There. That's better.
MRS
What did you study at Oxford?
NIKOS
Political science.
MRS
But that's meaningless. Especially in Greece.
NIKOS
That's why I run a hotel. [To his cards] Beautiful.
MRS
[To DAVID] Take another photograph. With Nikos.
DAVID
Yes?
MRS
The two of us.
NIKOS
No.
MRS
Yes. Please. You would like that?
DAVID
I would.
MRS
Speak up, child.
DAVID
I mumble. I'm sorry.
MRS
You what?
DAVID
Mumble. [He circles them again with his light meter.]
MRS
Well, yes, you swallow your words. So did the dentist. Too much saliva, he said. I'd say a miserable childhood. Which would explain your clothing. You're so overdressed. It's blazing hot, isn't it? My, my, you're buttoned. What is the temperature, Nikos?
NIKOS
I must ask you ...
MRS
Oh, Nikos, ask not, ask not. Come—have your picture took, too. Leave those silly cards. It is a lonely game, no matter what you say. I used to play it endlessly. While the dentist was dying. It's a game for that. Stand here. Put your arm around me. Host and guest. Milk and honey.
NIKOS
Ifit pleases you. [Rises] Where?
MRS
Right here. [Motions by her side] Do you like this, dear?
DAVID
Closer.
MRS
Pardon?
DAVID
Closer.
MRS
Swallow all the saliva and then speak. Closer, Nikos. Just stand still. He has to run around with that silly little thing and focus. You're a handsome man, Nikos. Nice legs. The dentist's legs were appalling.
NIKOS
Tomorrow evening, my dear Mrs. Honey . . .
MRS
Oh, Nikos, you're so single-minded. Don't you ever ramble?
NIKOS
There is a special guest coming for dinner.
MRS
When?
NIKOS
Tomorrow evening.
MRS
Oh. You said that.
NIKOS
Yes.
MRS
Well, that's nice. I hope he enjoys it. Will you be serving something with lamb?
NIKOS
I must ask you . . .
MRS
You mustn't, you mustn't. Don't talk. He doesn't want your mouth to move.
DAVID
It's alright. I'm not ready. [He ducks under the hood.]
MRS
I think he said he's not ready. The child mumbles. He's also very slow. But I'm sure he wants to get your legs into the shot. Actually—in truth—I rarely saw the dentist's legs.
NIKOS
I must ask you to give up your table once again.
MRS
I always had excellent diction. Never mumbled. You ask too much.
NIKOS
For one evening only.
MRS
One evening too many.
NIKOS
It is a special favour.
MRS
It is my table. Mine. It has the best view. Of the olive trees. Of the beach. Of the sea. Of that empty little rowboat in the water. Of Albania. I come to this hotel because of the view of Albania.
NIKOS
I am serious.
MRS
I am, too. About the table. I do reserve this table, as well as my room, four months in advance. Do any of your other clients do that? I seriously doubt it.
NIKOS
This guest is very special.
MRS
[To DAVID] Aren't you ready yet?
DAVID
Almost.
MRS
I'm sorry.
DAVID
Almost.
MRS
Almost. More special than Mr. Durrell?
NIKOS
Yes.
MRS
Has he written a quintet, then? Lordy, this insignificant village is crawling with great artists.
DAVID
Almost ready.
MRS
You needn't shout. The dentist was the same way; if he wasn't mumbling, he was shouting. Smile, Nikos. Tell me, who is this very special guest? Is it Mr. Auden or Mr. Stravinsky or, gracious me, Mr. Picasso? Are they all rushing to Corfu? Do they think the view of Albania might inspire them?
NIKOS
I could choke you. Mrs. Honey.
DAVID
Now.
MRS
What?
DAVID
I said now.
MRS
Oh. Now. Now, Nikos. Smile. Just imagine your hands around my neck, and smile.
NIKOS
He is not an artist.
MRS
Then he doesn't deserve a table.
NIKOS
He is a king.
DAVID
[Presses the switch] Got it.
MRS
A king!
DAVID
One more.
MRS
Goodness—dime a dozen.
DAVID
This one will be faster.
MRS
You meet kings and princes and dukes everywhere these days. Running around without their countries, looking for a free meal. Where is this one from?
DAVID
Can you smile again?
NIKOS
From here.
MRS
Here?
DAVID
Please?
NIKOS
Yes. Here.
MRS
Greece?
NIKOS
Greece.
DAVID
Please!
MRS
Sorry?
DAVID
Say cheese.
MRS
Why?
DAVID
[Presses the switch] Thank you.
MRS
Oh, Nikos. Well, well, well. So it's that king. Your king. This king. The king. Dining at the Kistos Inn?
NIKOS
He has a home nearby.
MRS
With Mr. Durrell? Are they lovers? Oh, you Greeks are so sly. Does the king come here for your legs?
NIKOS
Choke.
MRS
[To DAVID] Take one of Nikos—by himself.
NIKOS
No—no—no. [He moves away and sits at his table again and resumes his game of solitaire.]
MRS
Nikos is obviously more important than he seems. Oh, Nikos, Nikos. [Pause] No. I won't give up the table.
NIKOS
You can sit at my table.
MRS
It's too far away. It's near the kitchen. It attracts Greek mosquitoes.
NIKOS
You can sit with the honeymoon couple.
MRS
With them?
NIKOS
I'll put them with the Germans.
MRS
That would destroy their marriage. So would I. I have a wicked tongue. No, no.
NIKOS
You can sit with the French scientist.
MRS
He'll talk to me. In French. No, no.
NIKOS
You can sit with your friend here. [Hepoints to DAVID, who is dismantling the camera.]
MRS
The child likes his solitude.
DAVID
I don't really mind....
MRS
He wants to be alone with his thoughts. He's happy that way. Alone. No, no, no. The king will have to sit with the Germans or the French scientist or even with you, although if you did study political science, I don't think you would have anything to say to him. No, Nikos, I won't give up my table. If he were an artist, like Mr. Durrell... then I'd grumble and I'd protest, but in the end, I'd graciously give in. But a king! A politician! He has blood on his hands, Nikos. Quite simply that. On some level—even if he's a nice young chap—he's a killer. You must know that. You studied that. A murderer. Oh, let him go to the local taverna. Let him dine with his deeply distressed subjects. But this table—is mine. [Pause]
NIKOS
I must have it.
MRS
Mine.
NIKOS
I will have it. [He throws the cards off the table and stands up.]
MRS
I've paid for it.
NIKOS
[Smiles] We've just killed each other not too long ago, Mrs. Honey. My people. Brother against brother. As they say. We watched each other die. [Pause] A Greek isn't a Greek if he tells the truth. Pardon my lapse. For this is the truth. I will have the table. [He kisses MRS. HONEY on her forehead.] Dear lady, I always enjoy your visits here. [NIKOS leaves.]
MRS
Smooth. Don't you think?
DAVID
I don't know.
MRS
Too smooth. There's a story there. How does a Greek boy from Corfu get to Oxford? Where did he learn perfect English? Why does he run a hotel? And where on earth is the other one, his brother? Oh, there is a story there. And we will never know it, you and I; we will never know it. When we travel, we pick up impressions, that's all. Never the truth. We're never invited inside, [Pause] You and I. [Pause] Will they be pretty photographs?
DAVID
I hope.
MRS
Are you pleased?
DAVID
I think so.
MRS
Aren't you hot? All those buttons.
DAVID
No.
MRS
I have very little in life, you see. The dentist is dead. The children don't need or want me. I see deceit everywhere. I have very little. Occasionally, in some insignificant village, in some country I barely know, I have a table. Do you understand? Why are you so quiet? Look at your hair. It just sits there. You must, give it some style. [She runs her finger through his hair, messing it up, trying to give it some body.] Someday, you will understand. [The lights fade. DAVID's voice is heard.]
DAVID
[Voice only] Why did I bring this awful camera? No one travels with a camera like this. It's so heavy. The plates weigh a ton. Why do I think I can take photographs? When I try to carry the camera and the suitcase together, it's a living hell. I keep throwing clothing away to make the suitcase lighter. It never gets lighter. It's a nightmare. The suitcase keeps brushing against my leg. And now the skin is falling off my leg. I have a rash on my arm as well. And my stomach hurts all the time. Maybe I'm dying. I think that I'm dying. What am I doing here? [His voice trails away.]
MRS
Sweet Jesus! What an evening. Do you hear a cow out there? I have some wine. And glasses. I couldn't sleep. I saw you on the veranda. I had waking dreams. Do you know them? Amazing landscapes, but one eye is open. Cows are much too noisy. Nikos Kistos has invaded my dreams. Manically chopping my table up with an axe. Here. [She sits at her table.]
DAVID
[Takes the glass] Thank you.
MRS
Drink it down very fast. Nikos Kistos is an evil man, mind my words; he's planning something. I smell enemies. I do, I do. Mind my words.
DAVID
[Drinks his wine] Oh, my God.
MRS
A bit like lava, isn't it? Have another. [She pours him another glass.] Glory be, child, don't you want to unbutton something?
DAVID
[Drinks the wine] Ohh!
MRS
[Drinks the wine] It's good for you. Go on. Another.
DAVID
I can't.
MRS
I insist.
DAVID
Well...
MRS
What?
DAVID
Do you ...? [He pauses for breath.]
MRS
Speak up, child.
DAVID
Do you know where the Levant is?
MRS
Oh. Somewhere, dear. Definitely somewhere. Somewhere out there. [Drinks her wine] We're not savouring this, are we? [She pours DAVID another glass.] Something to do with the Mediterranean. Places like Cyprus . .. Syria ... Lebanon ...
DAVID
[Drinks his wine] Jesus!
MRS
Do you know Beirut? That's probably part of the Levant. You must go there someday. It's an absolute jewel. I travel, you know—place to place to place.... [She pours herself another glass.] My, this stuff grows on you. I'm never anywhere for too long. They know my name at every American Express office in Europe and Asia. Not Australia. Doesn't interest me. I have this table reserved for another ten days. Damn Nikos Kistos! I don't want to move. [Drinks the wine] A tiny bit more? [She pours another glass.] Well. Beirut. Now, I'm not partial to nightclubs, but in Beirut nightclubs are as natural as the sea. There's one that is, in fact, by the sea; it has a spectacular, if rather grotesque, stage show, and, for a finale, a long, giant, life-sized train winds its way across the nightclub floor, weaving around the tables, with chorus girls standing on top of the railway cars, and cages coming down from the ceiling, those too with chorus girls, and flowers raining down on the tables, and gold coins as well, falling past the chorus girls in the cages onto the chorus girls on the train.
DAVID
[Holds his glass up] Beirut.
MRS
The glass is empty. I do get fond of certain places. Usually much later. After I've left. I'll give you the address of a lovely hotel there. And that nightclub. You will go there some day. On your travels. Nikos Kistos worries me, boy.
DAVID
I'm sick of my travels.
MRS
He wants this table, he does. It's only a piece of wood. Such a fuss.
DAVID
I'm sick of my travels.
MRS
And he's devious. And it's a king. Spells trouble.
DAVID
I'm sick of my travels.
MRS
What? Oh. Which travels?
DAVID
These. Here. There. This summer. My summer in Europe.
MRS
Where have you been?
DAVID
Everywhere.
MRS
For instance?
DAVID
Paris.
MRS
[Smiles] Ahl
DAVID
It was horrible.
MRS
Oh.
DAVID
London.
MRS
Ummm.
DAVID
A nightmare.
MRS
I see.
DAVID
Rome.
MRS
Roma!
DAVID
I hated it.
MRS
Hated it?
DAVID
Venice.
MRS
Miserable?
DAVID
Miserable.
MRS
[Laughs] I think you need these last few drops.... [She empties the dregs of the wine bottle into his glass.]
DAVID
Why is it so funny?
MRS
Did you not find Venice a little, a bit, a tiny bit—itsy-bitsy bit— beautiful? [She laughs again.]
DAVID
Yes.
MRS
Then why was it miserable?
DAVID
I don't know. Yes, I do. You see, it was me. I was ...
MRS
What?
DAVID
Nothing.
MRS
Go on.
DAVID
No.
MRS
Spit it out. [Laughs] I used to say that to the dentist—spit it out. Of course, he said the same thing to his patients. I wonder who picked it up from whom.
DAVID
I was lonely.
MRS
[Laughs] Oh. I'm sorry. I have a laughing fit. I don't mean it. Glory be! Lonely? Dear, dear.
DAVID
No one has talked to me. You're the first person on this entire trip who has talked to me.
MRS
It's all those buttons. You're so covered up. You do not invite conversation. I'm amazed you're not wearing a necktie. Are your parents the very religious type? Do they abhor the human body? I have heard that Orthodox Jews make love through a hole in the sheet—is that true of your parents?—and if so, do they tear a hole, or is it meticulously cut? Well, well, well—you are not a happy specimen, are you? Still in school?
DAVID
Just out. Out. Into the darkness ... [He stands up—can't handle it—sits down again.]
MRS
And child, your hair. It's so homeless. Did you notice, in London, during your nightmare stay there, that some of the young men are now wearing their hair long and wild and quite beautiful? Let your hair grow, boy. And muss it a bit. And treat yourself to sideburns. And slash away your trousers. Yes— show us your legs. Do you have a shape to you? Let's see it, child.
DAVID
I'm drowning.
MRS
Oh dear.
DAVID
I'm tottering .,,
MRS
You're drunk.
DAVID
On the edge ...
MRS
Very drunk.
DAVID
Of an abyss!
MRS
I'm sorry.
DAVID
I don't have nice legs. [He starts to cry.] I'm drunk. Michael! Do you have more wine? My legs are scrawny. My kneecaps stick out. He doesn't love me at all. He lied to me.
MRS
Shh! You will wake the hotel up. Nikos Kistos will have us arrested for drinking. He's planning something, Nikos Kistos. The king could order a firing squad.
DAVID
I'm burning!
MRS
It's the sun. It was extremely strong this afternoon.
DAVID
I'm on fire.
MRS
Or then again, he could try to poison me.
DAVID
I'm lost in an inferno!
MRS
[Sharply] Inferno? Dear, dear. Retsina, you old dog. Now, let's pull ourselves together.
DAVID
I'm so unhappy. I want to die! I want to join a kibbutz!
MRS
Well, at least you have a sense of priority.
DAVID
I'm twenty-three....
MRS
That old!
DAVID
So much of me has been washed away....
MRS
You tend to overdramatize. Did you know that? Is that why you take photographs? Are you attracted to the theatre? Do you have any friends?
DAVID
I'm falling ... falling....
MRS
Oh, I'm no good at this. Mothering.
DAVID
Into the abyss ...
MRS
Never suited me. Ask my children. They loathe me for good reason.
DAVID
The abyss ...
MRS
No, child. It's not an inferno. It's not even a brushfire. It's not an abyss. Do you know what an abyss is?
DAVID
What?
MRS
Watching the dentist disappear before your eyes. Cancer. That's an abyss. Watching his flesh melt away from his face. Watching a truck drive through his body every night. That's an abyss. Now dry your eyes and go to bed. We mustn't wake the evil Kistos up. The Kisti. Where is his brother? [She stands up and looks at the sea.]
DAVID
I'm embarrassed. I didnt mean to ...
MRS
My son sent a letter with his last cheque. He's left his job. He's heading for San Francisco with his wife. He says the world is changing. There's a new kind of life. He says he has hope. Well. Glory Hallelujah, bless his soul. And—his hair is very long. He sent a photograph. I think he looks quite stunning. He's not much older than you. [She brushes DAVID's hair.] Please. Let it grow.
DAVID
Mrs. Honey?
MRS
What?
DAVID
Your nightgown—is on upside down.
MRS
Well, so it is. Fancy that. [She leaves.]
COSTOS
Water.
DAVID
What?
COSTOS
You wanted water?
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Glass of water.
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
I make mistake?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
Think you want water.
DAVID
No. [Pause. DAVID starts to leave again.]
COSTOS
I bring it to your room.
DAVID
Bring what?
COSTOS
Water.
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Room number six?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
I bring it.
DAVID
I don't want water.
COSTOS
I was going to bring at any rate.
DAVID
You were?
COSTOS
After I swim. Tonight. To room six. To you.
DAVID
You were?
COSTOS
Yes.
DAVID
Why?
COSTOS
But now you here. Better. So drink it here. [He holds out the glass.]
DAVID
But I don't want. . .
COSTOS
You see. I know what you want.
DAVID
It's only water.
COSTOS
Drink it.
DAVID
Alright. [He drinks the water.]
COSTOS
Is good?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
Greek water is good?
DAVID
Excellent.
COSTOS
You know Barbara Ann?
DAVID
Who?
COSTOS
Barbara Ann.
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Song. By Beach Boys.
DAVID
Oh. Oh! I see. Beach Boys. No. I don't listen to ...
COSTOS
I'm still wet. From sea. Dry under stars. Here. Take chairs. [He goes to the side of the veranda where the beach chairs are piled up and drags two to the centre of the veranda.] You help me.
DAVID
Why not? [He lies down on the other chair.] My Godi [Staring at the sky] Look at them.
COSTOS
Tomorrow big day.
DAVID
Is it?
COSTOS
King is here.
DAVID
I know.
COSTOS
We have good king.
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
No king in America.
DAVID
No. So many stars. I feel almost...
COSTOS
Greece happy with king ...
DAVID
Almost...
COSTOS
King is like father.
DAVID
Almost someplace else.
COSTOS
You know Sergeant Barry Sadler?
DAVID
Who?
COSTOS
"Ballad of Green Berets." War song. Big hit. Vietnam. You like it?
DAVID
I don't know it.
COSTOS
No wars in Greece anymore. You know this—? [Sings] "Under the boardwalk, we'll be fallin' in love. Under the boardwalk, boardwalk."
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Drifters.
DAVID
Oh. I see.
COSTOS
Move chairs closer. [He reaches out and pulls DAVID's chair directly next to his, then puts his arm on DAVID's shoulder.] I know what you want. Í have many brains. I go to university next year. You go to university?
DAVID
I did.
COSTOS
You leave.
DAVID
Graduate.
COSTOS
You smart person, too. You study with the camera?
DAVID
Alitile.Yes.
COSTOS
I can tell. Smart person. Take pictures for money?
DAVID
Not yet. Someday.
COSTOS
[Sings] "Cool cat, lookin' for a kitty. Gonna look in every corner of the city." Know that?
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Lovin'Spoonful.
DAVID
I never listen to contemporary...
COSTOS
[Sings] "And baby, if the music is right, I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night." [Pause] How I learn my English. Sonny. Cher. Mamas. Papas. Simon. Garfunkel. Good teachers. My English good?
DAVID
Very.
COSTOS
You have girlfriend?
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
I have many.
DAVID
Oh.
COSTOS
Boyfriends, too.
DAVID
Oh.
COSTOS
You have boyfriends?
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Not even one?
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
You not serious.
DAVID
I am. Serious. No. [Sits up] I think I am going to sleep now. [Rises] I'm just a little drunk.
COSTOS
You stay.
DAVID
I can't.
COSTOS
What make you drunk?
DAVID
Retsina.
COSTOS
It is good, retsina?
DAVID
Yes. But bitter.
COSTOS
Bitter—good?
DAVID
Yes. Bitter very good. But too much. I feel strange.
COSTOS
You feel happy?
DAVID
Happy? No! No happy. [Pause] Strange.
COSTOS
Strange—good?
DAVID
I don't know. I can't answer.
COSTOS
Look at stars. Beautiful. Greek night. Sound of waves. Magic. I know what you want. I have many brains. I will go to university. I'll be smart person, too. [Sings] "We'll sing in the sunshine. We'll laugh everyday." Know that?
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Gale Garnett. Big hit. No sunshine now. Stars. [He brushes his hand across DAVID's month.]
DAVID
Stars.
COSTOS
It is very hot, no?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
"Then I'll be on my way" [Pause] I am very hot. You also?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
Why you never unbutton? [He moves DAVID's hand across his chest.] Greece very hot. You like Greece? [Heputs DAVID's hand on his nipple.]
DAVID
Very much.
COSTOS
You think Greece beautiful?
DAVID
Very.
COSTOS
Unbutton. [He starts to unbutton DAVID's shirt.]
DAVID
No. [He sits up.]
COSTOS
What is wrong?
DAVID
Nothing.
COSTOS
I want to look at you.
DAVID
You do? Really?
COSTOS
Yes. Sure. [Sings] "And it's magic, if the music is groovy."
DAVID
Everybody wants me to unbutton. But I don't.... Oh. What the hell. [He pulls his shirt open.] Unbuttoned! Oh God, I think I tore it. I tore my shirt. This is a catastrophe.
COSTOS
Leave open.
DAVID
I only have a few shirts with me. And this one drip-dries and ...
COSTOS
Like shirt torn. Sexy.
DAVID
Sexy?
COSTOS
Yes.
DAVID
Really?
COSTOS
Really.
DAVID
Me? No.. ..
COSTOS
Your skin so white. No beach?
DAVID
No beach, no. Can't swim. I visit ruins. No beach. My family... they think modern bathing suits are ... Oh, that's silly.... I don't listen to them anyway.... I... can't swim, though....
COSTOS
[Sings] "Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, sing a song for me." I know what you want. I have many brains. [He pulls DAVID's shirt completely open.]
DAVID
It's cold. There's a draught.
COSTOS
It's hot. [Sings] "Hot town, summer in the city." [Pause] Put hand here.... [He places DAVID's hand on his crotch.] [Sings] "I'm not sleepy and there's no place I'm going to." [He pulls DAVID dovm.j Lips here. [He kisses DAVID.]
DAVID
Yes. I like.
COSTOS
Very much?
DAVID
Very much.
COSTOS
[Sings] "In the jingle-jangle morning, I'll come following you." [He speaks in a murmur as he explores DAVID's body.] Do you feel the jingle-jangle? You come following through under the boardwalks? What a day for a daydream. All my thoughts are far away. Do you believe in magic? Homeward bound, I'm homeward bound....
DAVID
Oh ...
COSTOS
These boots are made for walking.. . .
DAVID
Ohh,,.
COSTOS
Walk all over you.
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
I make you happy?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
Very happy?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
Sputnik. You go up like Sputnik. All the leaves are brown and the sky is grey....
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
Sputnik. Into space.
DAVID
Ohh ...
COSTOS
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to....
DAVID
Ohh ...
COSTOS
If I didn't tell her, I could leave today....
DAVID
Ohhh.
COSTOS
California dreamin' on a winter's day....
DAVID
Ohhh! [DAVID has an orgasm.]
COSTOS
So soon? Sputnik land so soon?
DAVID
I think so.
COSTOS
Too soon.
DAVID
I'm sorry.
COSTOS
I do not give pleasure?
DAVID
Yes. I'm sorry.
COSTOS
You do not like me?
DAVID
But I do.
COSTOS
Not very much.
DAVID
I do. Honestly. Very much. You give pleasure.
COSTOS
You make joke.
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
This truth?
DAVID
Yes. Truth.
COSTOS
Promise.
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
Great pleasure?
DAVID
Yes. [Pause] Great.
COSTOS
I make you happy?
DAVID
Yes. [Pause] Thank you.
COSTOS
Kiss me thank you.
DAVID
Good,
COSTOS
Now give present. [He sits up.]
DAVID
Oh. Really?
COSTOS
Yes.
DAVID
I must be dreaming.
COSTOS
No dream. Give present.
DAVID
You don't have to.
COSTOS
Have to what?
DAVID
Give me a present. [Smiles] You already did.
COSTOS
You make joke?
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
You give present.
DAVID
What?
COSTOS
You give present. To me.
DAVID
Oh.
COSTOS
I close eyes.
DAVID
Why?
COSTOS
For pleasure.
DAVID
But I thought...
COSTOS
Because I give pleasure.
DAVID
I thought...
COSTOS
To say you like me.
DAVID
I thought. . . You found me.. . .
COSTOS
To show I make you happy.
DAVID
I thought you thought I was ... I thought you wanted to ... I thought... [Pause] I am stupid.
COSTOS
[Sings] "Cool down, evenin in the city, dressed so fine and a lookin so pretty."
DAVID
I was almost... someplace else. I am very stupid.
COSTOS
Watch.
DAVID
What?
COSTOS
Your watch.
DAVID
Yes?
COSTOS
Give me your watch.
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Little present.
DAVID
Not my watch.
COSTOS
I like watch.
DAVID
It's mine.
COSTOS
I wear watch and think of you ... underneath stars.
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
You buy another.
DAVID
Absolutely not.
COSTOS
Radio.
DAVID
I don't have one.
COSTOS
You must.
DAVID
I don't.
COSTOS
Americans have radios.
DAVID
I don't.
COSTOS
Listen to music.
DAVID
I don't.
COSTOS
Beatles.
DAVID
No radio.
COSTOS
Ring.
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
This ring. Very nice.
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Fit my finger. [Hepulls at the ring.]
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Same size.
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Pretty ring ...
DAVID
No. My grandmother gave it to me.
COSTOS
Grandmother?
DAVID
Yes. Old lady.
COSTOS
Oh, [Pause] Very good. Very good. Grandmother. You keep.
DAVID
Thank you.
COSTOS
Camera.
DAVID
Certainly not.
COSTOS
Not big one. You have small one, too.
DAVID
No. No cameras.
COSTOS
I go to room number six; I take camera. Small one.
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Not big one.
DAVID
Neither one.
COSTOS
You don't like me.
DAVID
I do.
COSTOS
I do not give pleasure.
DAVID
You did.
COSTOS
You make fun of me.
DAVID
I don't.
COSTOS
You insult me.
DAVID
I'm not.
COSTOS
Then give me camera.
DAVID
I won't.
COSTOS
I lie on floor.
DAVID
No camera.
COSTOS
I lie on floor. I scream. I say you hurt me.
DAVID
Hurt you?
COSTOS
[Holds his groin] Here. In the sex. You do bad things to me. I cannot move. I cry. You hurt me. I call the police.
DAVID
Police?
COSTOS
They come to room. Number six. They put you in prison. I am young. Seventeen. Against the law. I scream.
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
You hurt me. I cannot move. I am screaming. [Shouts] Police!
DAVID
Stop it.
COSTOS
You give me camera?
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Police!
DAVID
You'll wake everybody up.
COSTOS
Police!
DAVID
Ouch!
COSTOS
You touch me. You hurt me. You hurt my sex. Tomorrow king come. King find me. Under table. Almost dead. King take me in arms. King cry out— "My people, my people!" I screaming now. Police!
DAVID
You will wake the entire hotel.
COSTOS
I scream louder. Police!
DAVID
Alright! The watch! Take it! [DAVID takes the watch off his wrist and holds it out.]
COSTOS
Forme?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
A present?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
Your watch?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
You sure?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
You like me?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
I make you happy?
DAVID
Yes.
COSTOS
Very happy?
DAVID
Very happy.
COSTOS
Then 1 take it. [He grabs the watch.[ What a surprise. A present! [He puts the watch on.] I am beautiful, no?
DAVID
No.
COSTOS
Thank you. I am beautiful. I have watch. I make you happy. You make me happy. I give you great pleasure. Now I go to sleep. You are nice. Pretty present. Pretty stars. Pretty night. [Sings] "We'll sing in the sunshine. We'll laugh everyday." [Hepicks up his blanket.] [Sings] "We'll sing in the sunshine." [He drops the blanket on his shoulders.] [Sings] "And I'll be on my way." [COSTOS leaves.]
DAVID
"Ma nishtanah, halilah hazeh, mikahl halalos ... "
DAVID
[Voice only] When I was a child, I sang it at Passover. "Ma nishtanah ... " Why is this night different than any other? Why did that come racing into my head? Am I losing my mind? Michael! [Pause] One thing washes over another. How long will it take for my hair to grow? Why do I sleep in my underwear? Cross this out. Don't write in this journal when you're drunk. Why is this night different? Because they talk to me now. Touch me. But it's still the same! [Pause] If only my hair were long ... if only something would change .. . [His voice fades away.]
MRS
Waiting! I'm waiting. Hello! I'm waiting. [She rings her bell.] I demand my breakfast. [She rings the bell again.]
DAVID
Good morning.
MRS
They have instituted a blockade of my table. They have imposed sanctions. They are attempting to terrorize my stomach. This inn offers room and famine. Did you sleep well?
DAVID
No.
MRS
Nor 1.1 anticipated trouble. [She rings the bell] [Shouts] I shall protest to the ambassador! [Pause] They shall not succeed. Mr. Gandhi, decent as politicians go, often went without food, and he became a country. I myself was such an atrocious cook that I would spend days not touching a morsel. The dentist, poor thing, and the children had to eat my disastrous offerings—but I possessed the wisdom to abstain. I believe your own religion has a day of ritual starvation.
DAVID
Yom Kippur.
MRS
Indeed. Then I hereby declare Yom Kippur at this table.
DAVID
On Yom Kippur you atone for your sins.
MRS
Fair enough—that will help me pass the time. My primary sin was to book the wrong inn. But book I did, and stay I shall. Nikos Kistos has joined battle with the wrong pain in the neck. [Pause] Did you hear noise last night? Screaming?
DAVID
No.
MRS
In my mind, then. There was screaming in my mind. [She looks at DAVID.] Do I spy a top button undone? And what is this late hour?
DAVID
I overslept.
MRS
Did you?
DAVID
Yes.
MRS
Glory be! Has retsina had a salutory effect? A little vice is not to be sneezed at. DAVID; What?
MRS
Too much wine is an excellent thing sometimes. After all, you need something to atone for on what is it called?
DAVID
Yom Kippur.
MRS
"Dear God, I undid my button; forgive me." You're well on your way, boy, well on your way.
DAVID
I'm hungry. I want my breakfast.
MRS
It is a pity you were not up slightly earlier, however. You might have witnessed a stupendous argument. The honeymoon couple. It seems she has misplaced her wedding ring, and he is none too pleased about it. I had an enormous temptation to offer some solicitous advice and thus make things worse, but it's difficult to cause trouble on an empty stomach. And they did manage to wolf down their tea and toast, no matter how fierce their disagreement. I am not beyond stealing scraps. [She rings the bell.] If only this were louder. If it were not so heavy, I would travel with a gong.
NIKOS
Good morning, dear lady.
MRS
Well, well, well.
NIKOS
Beautiful day.
MRS
I suppose.
NIKOS
Not a cloud in the sky.
MRS
No.
NIKOS
Good for the suntan.
MRS
Excellent.
NIKOS
Have you enjoyed breakfast?
MRS
Oh dear—how foolish of me. I forgot all about breakfast. I've been enjoying the view. Do you see that rock jutting out into the sea? There's an old woman dressed in black sitting on it. She has one eye. Most interesting. I could watch her all day.
NIKOS
Would you like breakfast?
MRS
Oh. I don't know.
NIKOS
We would be happy to serve you.
MRS
Well, if it makes you happy, Nikos.
NIKOS
[To COSTOS] Ferte ris to ithico ρ roime.
COSTOS
Malista, kirie. [He goes into the kitchen.]
MRS
Well, well, well.
NIKOS
She has the evil eye.
MRS
Who?
NIKOS
The woman on the rock.
MRS
And it's her only one. What a pity. [Pause] Is it aimed at you or me?
NIKOS
You look very pretty this morning, Mrs. Honey.
MRS
I loathe small talk. I practise it all the time, but I loathe it in others. I smell deceit. I can taste it. You won't get the table, Nikos.
NIKOS
I'm winning.
MRS
What?
NIKOS
At cards.
MRS
Ah. This is sumptuous.
NIKOS
Of course.
MRS
You seem to have given me something special.
NIKOS
Have we?
MRS
Something not required. Something not on the menu. Something beyond orange juice, tea, and toast.
NIKOS
A surprise, then.
MRS
Indeed. [She stares at NIKOS, sizing up the situation.] Take it away.
NIKOS
Lift the lid.
MRS
I don't want it. Take it away.
NIKOS
Lift the lid.
MRS
I'm not hungry. Take it away.
NIKOS
Lift the lid.
MRS
I think not. The specialty of the house is trouble. I smell deceit. Take it away.
NIKOS
What is it?
MRS
My jewel box.
NIKOS
Your jewel box, dear lady?
MRS
Yes.
NIKOS
Astonishing.
MRS
Where did you get my jewel box? Have you been rummaging through my room? I shall issue a complaint. I shall go to the police. This was packed away in a suitcase.
NIKOS
It is most attractive.
MRS
Yes.
NIKOS
An antique.
MRS
The dentist gave it to me. A long time ago. What is it doing here?
NIKOS
It is yours, though?
MRS
You know it is.
NIKOS
Why don't you open it?
MRS
Ah. [Pause] I think not.
NIKOS
Don't you want to make sure ...?
MRS
Make sure?
NIKOS
That nothing is missing.
MRS
No.
NIKOS
I think you must open it.
MRS
I think I must not.
NIKOS
You haven't looked.
MRS
No. I haven't.
NIKOS
Beautiful things.
MRS
Yes.
NIKOS
Won't you look?
MRS
No.
NIKOS
This is lovely.
MRS
My mother's.
NIKOS
Exquisite.
MRS
My mother's as well.
NIKOS
And this?
MRS
I bought it in New Delhi.
NIKOS
And this?
MRS
Idon'tknow.
NIKOS
You don't know.
MRS
I've never seen it before.
NIKOS
You've never seen it before?
MRS
It's not mine.
NIKOS
It must be.
MRS
It isn't. It's too vulgar. It's not mine.
NIKOS
Then whose is it?
MRS
I have no idea.
NIKOS
And what is it doing in your jewel box?
MRS
I have no idea.
NIKOS
Ah, but it could be ... it looks remarkably like ...
MRS
Oh. I see. I see. Oh, yes. I see.
NIKOS
The ring that until this morning adorned the finger of that sweet young girl on her honeymoon. She mislaid it.
MRS
Indeed.
NIKOS
Is it hers?
MRS
I would not know.
NIKOS
I think it is.
MRS
It would not surprise me.
NIKOS
And what is this?
MRS
A watch.
NIKOS
Yours?
MRS
No.
NIKOS
Whose?
MRS
I have no idea. I think this game is over.
NIKOS
Whose watch?
M
I don't know. Nikos, leave it be.
NIKOS
Is this your watch?
DAVID
Mine?
NIKOS
It looks like yours.
DAVID
No, it doesn't.
NIKOS
It looks like the watch I have noticed on your wrist.
DAVID
No.
NIKOS
Let me see your wrist.
MRS
Is it yours, child? Tell the truth.
DAVID
Yes. I think it is.
MRS
How did it get here?
DAVID
I don't know.
DAVID
No.
MRS
Then I'm lost. [She returns to her table.] Lost. [To NIKOS] And I suppose your cousin is the police chief?
NIKOS
No.
MRS
Oh?
NIKOS
My uncle.
MRS
[Smiles] Of course.
NIKOS
I'd hate to disturb him.
MRS
You needn't. An Oxford education has served you well. You are clever, you and your brother. What have you done with him? Have you murdered him? There is, of course, no one to help me. I am totally unattached. The king must have his dinner. I believe there is a bus at noon. A local bus filled with livestock. Before I reclaim my jewel box, please tell me if it contains any other surprises. Has the French scientist misplaced an ankle bracelet? And the Germans? Have they suffered a loss?
NIKOS
No. Just a ring and a watch.
MRS
Well then ... [She doses the jewel box.] Take the breakfast away, Nikos. I've lost my appetite. [Rises] It is stupid. For a table! Good Lord. [MRS. HONEY leaves her table. She walks past DAVID.]
DAVID
I'm sorry.
MRS
It's not your fault. Don't worry. Others will talk to you. You'll see. [She starts to leave, then turns back.] I would like the photograph. Send it to me?
DAVID
Yes.
MRS
Thank you.
DAVID
Where?
MRS
Care of American Express.
DAVID
Which city?
MRS
Choose one. [MRS. HONEY leaves.]
DAVID
[Voice only] There is a cool breeze tonight. From the Levant. And clouds. You cannot see the stars. You cannot see Albania. And it is raining. The afternoon was glorious, however. Very hot. I wasn't here when she took the bus. I was on the beach. The rain started around 5
B
tiny whitewashed houses on tiny whitewashed streets, crisscrossing each other, built higher and higher on steep cliffs overlooking the sea.
OLIVER
There you are, luv. It's five in the morning. I didn't hear you get up. What are you looking at? Rain. Nothing out there but rain. You can barely see the volcano. Silly life we lead, isn't it? Wake up every morning and stare at a dead crater in the middle of the sea. Still, we like it, don't we? Come on now, Mr. Hosani, let's sit down. [He takes DANIEL's hand and leads him very gently to a chair.] That's a good boy. Aren't we a good boy? Down we go.... [He carefully places DANIEL in the chair.] You have some colour in your face. Yes, I like that, I like that. It's the sleep. You slept thirty hours. Means you're depressed, don't it, luv? Let's see.... [He places his hand on DANIEL's wrist and takes an acu-pulse.] Not bad, not bad.... [He takes another pulse.[ Ummm ... [He takes another pulse.] Plenty to be depressed about. Another accident. While you slept. A plant in France. Fire. Reactor still burning. The air's filled with it. Coming this way. The rain will bring it. What a way to start the nineties. [He takes another pulse.] Hmmm... liver's a little low. Hasn't stopped raining. Used to freshen things, rain. Don't blame you sleeping, luv. Your back's not too good—it's alright; we'll fix it. ... Let's see—what else happened while you've been asleep? Heather's come from New York. Dylan's with her. And a Hollywood producer arrived last night with a girlfriend. He wants to film your book. As a musical. Oh, that's got the pulses racing!
DANIEL
Cream cheese.
OLIVER
Exactly.
DANIEL
Beautiful.
OLIVER
What?
DANIEL
The apricot is beautiful.
OLIVER
Well, yes, always has been.
DANIEL
Don't discover me.
OLIVER
I don't think I can.
DANIEL
Please.
OLIVER
Don't worry.
DANIEL
Tangerine.
OLIVER
Don't know tangerine.
DANIEL
Tangerine! [He sits on the edge of the chair. ]
OLIVER
Why are you getting so excited? Come on .. . let's be a good boy.... Let's calm down....
DANIEL
I want to gallop.
OLIVER
It's better if you don't talk, Mr. Hosani. You know that.
DANIEL
Do you adagio?
OLIVER
No.
DANIEL
It's a nomad. Over there. Nomad! Splendour! Steal it. Mama! [He walks forward.]
OLIVER
You can't walk outside. It's raining.
DANIEL
Tangerine.
OLIVER
I don't know tangerine. Come on, down we go. ... [He places him back into the chair.] That's right.... That's a good boy.... There's nothing outside....
DANIEL
If... if...
OLIVER
Yes, yes....
DANIEL
If I could lamb chop.
OLIVER
If only we could all lamb chop.
DANIEL
I want to ...
OLIVER
Well, you can't, not today. ... Let's just lie back. ... That's better, isn't it?... Don't we feel better now?... Nice and quiet.. . let's be very calm.... [He goes to the table and removes a tray filled with needles.]
DANIEL
Starlight.
OLIVER
There. Calm. [He takes an acupuncture needle and sticks it into DANIEL's forehead.] Like a good boy.
DANIEL
Starlight.
OLIVER
Yes, luv, starlight. [Pause] Whatever that is.
HEATHER
I guess volcanoes are classic manic-depressives. Don't you think? Danny? It's so calm, it's been calm for thousands of years, but once that piece of rock out there was the life of the party. [Pause] Oh shit, Danny. [Pause] It's not supposed to rain like this. The weather has altered, you know. Summer is no longer summer; dry is no longer dry. The planet's distressed. I couldn't see the stars last night. Do you realize they are exactly the same stars that you and I stared at in Corfu? It doesn't seem that long ago. We were so young. Now look at us, eh? But they haven't changed. Danny? [Pause] Oh shit, Danny. [Pause] You know, you've grown handsome. There's some kind of irony in that. Your looks have improved with age. You were so awkward then. At least that part of the book is true. Danny? [Pause] My son is going to kill himself, and he doesn't even know it. What am I going to do? [Pause] You used to have so much to say. [Pause] I have no pity for you. [Pause] Oh shit, Danny. [Pause] [Calls into the kitchen] Oliver—what are you doing?
OLIVER
[Offstage] Be right there.
HEATHER
I'll bet the tourists have fled. What's a Greek island without sun? Don't the church bells ever stop ringing? We're on the edge of a cliff. This whole town is on the edge of a cliff. That's not reassuring. [Pause] Is it?
OLIVER
Coffee?
HEATHER
No thanks.
OLIVER
Wake you up.
HEATHER
He won't talk.
OLIVER
Sometimes he does. Sometimes he doesn't.
HEATHER
Where's Dylan?
OLIVER
Still sleeping.
HEATHER
Why isn't he up?
OLIVER
Drink some coffee.
HEATHER
Take it away. Caffeine's dangerous. I can show him this map. I have a plan. He'll think I'm crazy, though. He always does. Where's what's-his-name from Hollywood—Barnaby Grace?
OLIVER
Sleeping.
HEATHER
Everyone's sleeping. [She starts to cough, then wheeze, then can't catch her breath.]
OLIVER
Are you alright?
HEATHER
No. Don't. /She pulls her wrist away.] You'll be alarmed. I don't want your needles. I'm in remission, anyway. Everything's alright.
OLIVER
Why are you smoking?
HEATHER
I can't stop. I tried. You put needles in my ear once, remember? Ha! Didn't help. Well—we all have at least one passion that's killing us. The joke is my lungs are fine. It's everything else that's shot. [Pause] Hey, Danny, I'm dying. Did you know that? [Pause] You could address that point at least, you bastard. [Pause] What is he thinking of? When he dreams, does he hear the right words? Does he ever make himself laugh? [Pause] This house was a good idea. At least he's someplace beautiful—and reasonably bizarre. That's important for him. Did you know they call Santorini the island of vampires? Is that it, Danny? Is that what you've become? Then if only you'd bite. [Pause] Hey, Danny, remember—[Sings] "We'll sing in the sunshine. We'll laugh everyday." [Pause] The voice is gone, eh? I thought the part of the brain that receives music is self-contained. Is it, Oliver?
OLIVER
Seems to be.
HEATHER
Guess my singing no longer qualifies as music. No more two-bit career. Well, folk songs are out of date anyhow, aren't they? [Pause] Will you play tapes for him?
OLIVER
Soon.
HEATHER
You're so wise. Where the hell is Dylan? Do you know he's leaving for Paris in the morning?
OLIVER
Yes.
HEATHER
He's killing himself.
OLIVER
Do you want some tea?
HE ATHER
Can't you sneak a needle into Dylan and knock him out for a week?
OLIVER
Do you want some orange juice?
HEATHER
Maybe. Where are the oranges from? What kind of soil do they grow in?
OLIVER
Oranges grow on trees.
HEATHER
[Laughs] Oh, Oliver, thank God you're here.
OLIVER
I get paid well.
HEATHER
I know. I sign the cheques. Do you ever give yourself needles?
OLIVER
Have done.
HEATHER
Could you kill yourself?
OLIVER
With a needle?
HEATHER
Yes.
OLIVER
I suppose.
HEATHER
Painless?
OLIVER
Quite.
HEATHER
Lucky you.
DYLAN
Morning, guys.
HEATHER
Where are you going?
DYLAN
Huh?
HEATHER
Turn it down.
DYLAN
What?
HEATHER
Where are you going?
DYLAN
Swimming.
HEATHER
In the rain?
DYLAN
Yup.
HEATHER
You'll catch cold.
DYLAN
I'm going to, like, get wet either way. Wet's wet. [He starts for the door.]
HEATHER
Dylan?
DYLAN
Now what?
HEATHER
Have you reconsidered your plans?
DYLAN
Nope.
HEATHER
Don't go to Paris.
DYLAN
Oh, Mom, give it a rest, will you?
HEATHER
There's a cloud heading for Paris....
DYLAN
Can't hear you?
HEATHER
Filled with radioactive fallout. [She pulls the plug out of his ear.]
DYLAN
Ouch! You're being, like, very sixties.
HEATHER
This is real.
DYLAN
Mom, everything is real. If I dealt with real, I wouldn't deal.
HEATHER
What?
DYLAN
Your radioactive cloud is hoppin' around. It's, like, on a jag. It's a regular tourist bus. If it's Tuesday, like, it must be Venice, you know? It's coming to Greece, too. And Tokyo, New York, Moscow, all them places ... Like, where do you want me to go, Mars?
HEATHER
Sumba.
DYLAN
What?
HEATHER
It was just a thought.
DYLAN
Is this one of those days when you're out to lunch?
HEATHER
I was just thinking about Sumba.
DYLAN
I'm, like, afraid to ask—but—what's Sumba?
HEATHER
An island. Near Sumbawa.
DYLAN
Oh, of course. I should have known. [He pats her on the head.] I'm goin' swimming.
HEATHER
Look—I'll show you.
DYLAN
I don't believe this. Maps!
HEATHER
[Tracing a path on the map] Here ... this is Java....
DYLAN
Who would believe this?
HEATHER
And Java is not far from Sumbawa....
DYLAN
I'm, like, not telling this to my friends, no way—they think you're weird enough....
HEATHER
You're not looking!
DYLAN
Mom, this ain't good for you.
HEATHER
Alright, it is a bit unusual, but don't reject it without some thought. I do have my own logic. I phoned Fred last night, in New York. Remember Fred, the television weatherman?
DYLAN
No. Did you ask him when the rain's gonna stop?
HEATHER
He knows about prevailing winds.
DYLAN
Oliver, please, give her a needle.
HEATHER
He says no place is totally safe....
DYLAN
This is loony tunes.
HEATHER
But as far as he can tell, the safest spot is just about here.... [Shepoints to a place on the map.]
DYLAN
Where?
HEATHER
Here.
DYLAN
Sumba?
HEATHER
Yes.
DYLAN
It's in the middle of nowhere.
HEATHER
Exactly.
DYLAN
A couple of banana trees and some sand.
HEATHER
Probably.
DYLAN
I'll bet you're serious about this.
HEATHER
I'll give you the money. I'll even go with you.
DYLAN
To Sumba?
HEATHER
Yes.
DYLAN
Do they have daily flights from Santorini?
HEATHER
This is serious.
DYLAN
Mom, you're goin' round the bend. This kind of obsession with nuclear disaster has made you positively ga-ga. You, like, really want me to parachute into the South Pacific?
HEATHER
It's a bit fanciful, I suppose. Alright—let's compromise. Forget Sumba. Stay here.
DYLAN
I'm goin' to Paris. And I'm goin' for a swim. And they both ain't gonna kill me.
HEATHER
Dylan, the accident was yesterday. The cloud is at its fiercest now. Paris will get the worst of it.
DYLAN
So I'll glow slightly more than usual. Mom, this is, like, the third accident in two years. We've all fried our insides already, you know? It doesn't matter if I go to Paris. And if I do go to Paris, I can sell my language computer, and if I sell my language computer, I can make, like, maybe half a million bucks, and then possibly I can, like, be free to radiate on a slightly more mellow plane. You know what I mean, huh?
HEATHER
You're just a kid. What do you care about half a million dollars?
DYLAN
Oh, play that back—just play that one back. You know, you should be proud of me. I ain't a junkie, like everyone else. I am, technically, like, a genius.
HEATHER
You have no passion.
DYLAN
Passion sucks. (Hepoints to DANIEL.] Look at him. That's passion. Look at you, eating yourself up all your life because the world is wrong. So, hey, Mom, it is wrong, it is unfair, it is galloping down the drain—so what else is new? What the hell can you do about it? You're killing yourself, like, quicker than any bomb would. You've got major fallout inside of you. You're supposed to take it easy. You're all tensed up. Why don't you exercise?
HEATHER
I'll be tranquil—absolutely tranquil—if you stay away from Paris.
DYLAN
Fuck off, okay?—just fuck off—I won't take the blame for your insides. I don't take the blame for nothin'.
ALIKI
Good morning.
OLIVER
Morning.
DYLAN
Who is she?
OLIVER
The producer's companion. Name's Aliki. Greek. A student. She picked him up in an Athens bar.
DYLAN
Shit. [He goes to the door.] I don't totally lack passion. [He follows ALIKI outside, turning the volume up on his Walkman.]
HEATHER
[Shouts after him] That's not passion. [She starts to cough and gasp.] Damn it....
OLIVER
You're not, luv.
HEATHER
I am. I cant catch my breath. I'm okay. Leave me alone. [She stops gasping—breathes easier.]
OLIVER
I want you to relax.
HEATHER
No—no. I don't have time. Why don't you put on his tapes? Go. Go!
HEATHER
The world is burning—how the hell can I relax? [She sits on the floor next to the map.] What does it take to make a wind shift?
OLIVER
These are all Greek folk melodies. We like them, don't we? That's my boy.
T
Remember the days when people listened to music together?
BARNABY
Morning.
HEATHER
Ah. Mr. Grace.
BARNABY
[Looking over at DANIEL.] Is that really him?
HEATHER
More or less.
BARNABY
Daniel Hosani. It's hard to take in.
HEATHER
Take it in.
BARNABY
It's a real believe-it-or-noter, isn't it?
HEATHER
Pardon?
BARNABY
I thought he was dead.
HEATHER
Not quite.
BARNABY
I can't believe it's him.
HEATHER
It's him.
BARNABY
He's in a living-sad situation, eh?
HEATHER
Pardon?
BARNABY
Had some kind of stroke?
HEATHER
Oh. Yes.
BARNABY
When?
HEATHER
Three years ago.
BARNABY
Wow. He must be slow-timing it now. [Pause] I can't believe it's him.
HEATHER
You said that.
BARNABY
Daniel Hosani.
OLIVER
Would you like some coffee, Mr. Grace?
BARNABY
Yes—please—if it's a sugarless situation.
HEATHER
Coffee isn't healthy.
BARNABY
I'm sorry if I was strange when we arrived last evening.
HEATHER
Strange?
BARNABY
Incoherent.
HEATHER
Oh. It's alright. Don't worry. You're incoherent this morning as well.
BARNABY
I was exhausted. All those steps.
HEATHER
From the harbour?
BARNABY
Yes. We climbed up eight hundred of them to get here. I counted. A real grow-tired experience. Is this island really made of lava?
HEATHER
Some of it.
BARNABY
No wonder it's such a look-strange place. [Pause] Daniel Hosani.
HEATHER
Yes—that's very good—that's his name. Now why don't we discuss the film you plan to make?
BARNABY
I can't believe it's him. 1 admire him so much. What a feel-good writer. I was only fifteen when I read the book. But I understood every word.
HEATHER
Ah.
BARNABY
It made me glad to be alive, even though it had its depressing moments.
HEATHER
Ah.
HEATHER
Oliver—I've just had a blinding flash. My species is extinct.
BARNABY
It's still a favourite of mine.
HEATHER
Listen?
BARNABY
Books-on-tape.
HEATHER
Oh yes.
BARNABY
You can listen while you work.
HEATHER
Yes.
BARNABY
I haven't read a book in years.
HEATHER
Well, well, well.
BARNABY
She says that all the time.
HEATHER
Who?
BARNABY
Mrs. Honey.
HEATHER
Oh. [Pause] He picked it up from me.
OLIVER
He remembers melodies.
HEATHER
I used to know this song.... [She begins to hum.]
OLIVER
Sometimes he'll sing a word or two in Greek.
BARNABY
[To OLIVER] Am I correct in assuming he is now a thinking-impaired citizen?
OLIVER
Excuse me?
BARNABY
His mind is disabled.
OLIVER
His mind is fine.
HEATHER
You don't know anything about air currents, do you, Mr. Grace?
BARNABY
I've come here to make a pitch.
HEATHER
Yes, yes.
BARNABY
But how can I throw my concepts to a brain-scramble?
HEATHER
You throw them to me. I'm his legal guardian, God help me. Well, there was no one else. His parents no longer acknowledged him. His book was too openly gay. I'm his oldest friend, maybe his only friend. I was even with him that summer.
BARNABY
You were there?
HEATHER
Yes.
BARNABY
But you're not in the book.
HEATHER
Who says the book is true?
BARNABY
It has to be.
HEATHER
It's writing.
BARNABY
It's filled with truth.
HEATHER
That's different.
BARNABY
I can't believe it.... I can't believe you were actually there.... I can't believe he's actually Daniel Hosani.... I can't believe what's happened to him.
BARNABY
I have a vision about this. Daniel Hosani wrote a people-story and we should return to people-stories in Hollywood and people-stories should sing. I have the studios with me in this, and much of the industry, and most importantly, Jesus.
HEATHER
Pardon?
BARNABY
Jesus.
HEATHER
Oh.
BARNABY
You see, I was lost myself, very lost, and then I found Him. A light-blinder, alright. Now I think of Jesus as my coproducer. We're incorporated, if you know what I mean. He turned me away from gadgets and back to humanity. You see, we've spent years making look-smart films about—say—a boy and his pet monkey and his spaceship, and we got carried away with that spaceship and all the special effects it entailed. Jesus has taken me away from space. He hit me with a down-to-earther. Now I want to concentrate on the boy and the monkey. And I want to know, I really want to know, what makes that monkey tick. [Pause]
HEATHER
Ah.
BARNABY
Look, I have things with me—notes, charts, tapes, outlines—let me show you....
HEATHER
I really want Danny to hear this.
BARNABY
Good. I'll get them. [BARNABY leaves.]
HEATHER
Oh my God, Oliver, he's twelve years old, he has the brain of a lemon, he talks in tongues, and he thinks the book is about some fucking monkey!
OLIVER
Won't this upset Mr. Hosani?
HEATHER
I hope so.
OLIVER
You're up to something.
HEATHER
Maybe.
OLIVER
You're totally unfocused.
HEATHER
I know.
OLIVER
Let me help.
HEATHER
No. Leave me alone. Don't help me. There is no time.
DYLAN
Towels! Help! Oliver! Towels!
OLIVER
He thinks I'm the maid. [Hegoes into the bathroom.]
ALIKI
Don't.
DYLAN
Why not?
ALIKI
Hands—freezing.
DYLAN
She's, like, bored to death with that producer. Maybe I can lure her to Paris. What do you think, Mom?
HEATHER
I think you should stay here.
DYLAN
Listen, drop the red alert for a sec, okay? Forget nuclear and think sex— do you like her?
HEATHER
Does my opinion matter?
DYLAN
Of course not.
OLIVER
You're welcome.
DYLAN
[To ALIKI] Can I, like, dry you?
ALIKI
What?
DYLAN
[Shouts] Can I, like, dry you?
ALIKI
No.
DYLAN
You can dry me.
ALIKI
What?
DYLAN
Dry me.
ALIKI
Dry yourself.
DYLAN
Do you wanna go to Paris?
ALIKI
No.
DYLAN
Do you wanna kiss?
ALIKI
No.
DYLAN
Do you wanna see my computer?
ALIKI
[Laughs] No.
DYLAN
Ah, shit, come to Paris. Fly with me to Athens, like, this afternoon and then Paris tomorrow.
ALIKI
This afternoon? Athens?
DYLAN
Yes.
ALIKI
Three o'clock flight?
DYLAN
Yes.
ALIKI
We were supposed to take this plane. But this Jesus Man change plans. Now we take boat to Crete.
DYLAN
Like, forget him. Come with me.
ALIKI
You very sure? Three o'clock?
DYLAN
Yes.
HEATHER
Dylan? Are you going to shower?
DYLAN
Mom—not now. I'm seducing.
HEATHER
Take a shower.
DYLAN
I'm already wet.
HEATHER
From the rain. You don't know what's coming down in the rain. There's still some fallout around from this winter's accident.
DYLAN
Oh, put a lid on it.
ALIKI
She is very right. Take shower.
DYLAN
Yes?
ALIKI
I think so.
DYLAN
You do?
ALIKI
Listen to your mother.
DYLAN
Beats me. [Hegoes to the bathroom door.] Okay. I take shower. [He enters the bathroom.]
ALIKI
I take shower, too. [Shegoes into the bathroom.]
DYLAN
[Offstage] Jesus!
HEATHER
Jesus seems to be on everyone's lips today. [Pause] Oliver?
OLIVER
What?
HEATHER
Did that just happen?
OLIVER
Suppose so.
HEATHER
She's in the shower with my son?
OLIVER
Suppose so.
HEATHER
Oh. [Pause] Have they been introduced? [Pause] Well. [Pause] WellPause] What do you think they're doing?
OLIVER
Here, let's have that now, Mr. Hosani. No more music. That's right; that's a good boy. Do we want to take a walk around the house?
HEATHER
Do you think they're washing each other?
OLIVER
Probably.
HEATHER
That's nice. [Pause] That's very clean. [Pause] Did they lock the door?
OLIVER
Didn't hear the latch,
HEATHER
Ah. [Pause] it's unlocked, then?
OLIVER
Yes. [Pause]
HEATHER
Still raining outside?
OLIVER
Yes.
HEATHER
Shame.
OLIVER
Yes.
HEATHER
Rain.
OLIVER
I know.
HEATHER
Completely immature.
OLIVER
I know.
HEATHER
We shouldn't be doing this.
OLIVER
I know.
HEATHER
What do you hear?
OLIVER
Water.
HEATHER
What else?
OLIVER
Just water.
HEATHER
Look through the keyhole.
OLIVER
Absolutely not.
HEATHER
Go on.
OLIVER
I've never done anything like that in my life.
HEATHER
Just a peek.
OLIVER
No.
HEATHER
A tiny peek.
OLIVER
It's good to see you smile.
HEATHER
Go on.
OLIVER
Alright. [He gets down on his knees and peeks through the keyhole.]
HEATHER
Well?
OLIVER
Steam. I see steam.
HEATHER
And?
OLIVER
More steam. [He rises from his knees.]
HEATHER
Then open the door.
OLIVER
What?
HEATHER
Just a crack.
OLIVER
You open the door.
HEATHER
Don't you fancy him?
OLIVER
Of course not.
HEATHER
Really?
OLIVER
Well. A little.
HEATHER
So open the door.
OLIVER
You open it. Do you fancy him?
HEATHER
He's my son!
OLIVER
So?
HEATHER
Well—I fancy him the way mothers do, [Pause] Which is probably more than you think. [Pause] But not quite enough for alarm. I do like the way he looks naked. Like his father. Open the door. It has to be you. I've always given him independence. I mustn't intrude. But you can. Go on, go on... .
OLIVER
It's against everything I believe in.
HEATHER
I know. Go on. [Pause]
OLIVER
This is awful. [Pause. OLIVER quietly opens the door, just a crack. He looks in.]
HEATHER
Well?
OLIVER
Umm . . .
HEATHER
Yes?
OLIVER
Ummm .. .
HEATHER
What's ummmm?
OLIVER
Nice.
HEATHER
Nice?
OLIVER
Very nice.
HEATHER
What are they doing?
OLIVER
Umm ...
HEATHER
Oliver!
OLIVER
Ummm . .. ummm ...
HEATHER
Oh shit. [Shepushes OLIVER aside and looks through the crack.] Oh. Ah. [Pause] Ummm ... [Pause] Nice. [She closes the door.] It's sweet. It's so sweet. Isn't it sweet?
OLIVER
Yes.
HEATHER
Rubbing soap over each other.
OLIVER
Yes.
HEATHER
Feeling each other.
OLIVER
Yes.
HEATHER
That's very sweet.
OLIVER
Yes. [OLIVER opens the door again and looks, then closes the door.]
HEATHER
What are they doing now?
OLIVER
Soap—still.
HEATHER
Oh, Oliver—remember pleasure?
OLIVER
Barely.
HEATHER
Losing yourself.
OLIVER
Not really.
HEATHER
There were times, weren't there?
OLIVER
Few.
HEATHER
Do you have lovers?
OLIVER
People find me comforting and wise, two qualities that totally negate sex appeal. That's the truth, luv. I know how to make people feel better, genuinely feel better, and it has nothing to do with stroking a nipple. If I say I want that, they think I've betrayed their trust. The last time was five years ago.
HEATHER
My God!
OLIVER
And he didn't speak English. He had no idea I could soothe.
HEATHER
Don't you miss it?
OLIVER
All the time.
HEATHER
That's what I hated most about the hospital. My luck—the doctors were all young and handsome. They would lean over me and breathe on me and smile and touch me, and I felt so humiliated—all those tubes up my nose and scars down my body. I wanted to feel something or even to think something sexual, and I couldn't.
OLIVER
Just as well, luv. Sex is too dangerous now.
HEATHER
That's not true. You can do it—but safely. [Pause] My God, do you think they're being cautious? What are they doing?
OLIVER
[Peeking through the door] Soap.
HEATHER
That's a lot of soap. Dylan isn't cautious. If he was, he wouldn't go to Paris. For Christ's sake, Oliver, we have to get them out of there.
OLIVER
You're off again.
HEATHER
Do you have a condom?
OLIVER
What?
HEATHER
Slip a condom under the door!
OLIVER
[Laughs] Heather .. .
HEATHER
It isn't funny. I'm deadly serious. Slip a fucking condom under the door. Stop laughing. I don't want him to die. The world is burning, Oliver.
OLIVER
Stop it. [He grabs her by the neck and steadies her.]
BARNABY
I'm ready. I have everything. Except my companion. A real look-pretty, but I've misplaced her. She attached herself to me in Athens, you know. I don't want you to think ...
HEATHER
You needn't explain. She's swimming.
BARNABY
In the rain?
HEATHER
Yes. I am curious, I must admit—how do you square her with Jesus?
BARNABY
He's very flexible about my personal life.
HEATHER
Ah.
BARNABY
You know, I still can't believe that you were there.
HEATHER
Where?
BARNABY
Corfu.
HEATHER
Oh. Oh yes.
OLIVER
Shower's stopped.
HEATHER
Good.
OLIVER
Not good. Coming out.
HEATHER
Oh shit. What do we do?
OLIVER
Divert.
HEATHER
Yes—i was with him all summer.
OLIVER
And Mrs. Honey?
HEATHER
Yes.
BARNABY
What was her actuality factor?
HEATHER
Pardon?
BARNABY
Was she real?
HEATHER
Sure. By and large. Basically. There was a woman named Foster. [She manoeuvres BARNABY into a chair facing the sea.]
BARNABY
And the table?
HEATHER
Yes. I suppose. Fairly true.
BARNABY
And they made her leave?
HEATHER
In a way.
BARNABY
They found the watch on her?
HEATHER
Oh yes.
BARNABY
Amazing.
HEATHER
But then she was a kleptomaniac.
BARNABY
Oh. And David?
HEATHER
Well, Daniel was there. But then so was I. He certainly wasn't travelling alone.
BARNABY
And the waiter seduced him?
HEATHER
Probably the other way round.
BARNABY
Oh. And poor Mrs. Honey just kept on travelling?
HEATHER
Yes. But he left the reason out.
BARNABY
The reason?
HEATHER
Actually, the reason for the dentist's death.
BARNABY
The dentist?
HEATHER
Her husband, remember?
BARNABY
Oh, of course, but he's offscreen.
HEATHER
Indeed. Danny failed to say that the dentist's cancer was caused by radiation. That little desert place in Utah was known as a downwind town. Do you know what that is?
BARNABY
No.
HEATHER
Downwind from Nevada, from the atomic testing site. They had been exposed to radiation for years. No one ever told them to take precautions. Out of fifty families in that desert town only three escaped cancer. Mrs. Foster was too bright by half—she figured it out by the time the dentist died, but no one would listen to her, certainly not the government, who actively denied it until a few years ago, and not her children, who were in great danger themselves. They told her to shut up the way Dylan tells me to shut up. She was consumed by blinding sanity. Which made her rather a leper. She was never good company. So she took off—for everyplace else. He left all of that out.
BARNABY
That isn't something we can use.
HEATHER
Use?
BARNABY
In the movie.
HEATHER
Guess not.
BARNABY
Jesus doesn't disapprove of nuking, you know.
HEATHER
Oh?
BARNABY
In its place.
HEATHER
Oh—that Jesus! I'm sorry—I thought you meant the other one.
BARNABY
Are you making fun of me?
HEATHER
Yes.
BARNABY
We get used to that in Hollywood. But you have disappointed me.
HEATHER
How?
BARNABY
I did think the book was only pretend-fiction. I thought it all actually happened.
HEATHER
You're like me, Grace; you take things too seriously.
OLIVER
All clear.
BARNABY
Shall I pitch the film now?
OLIVER
Mr. Hosani needs a rest.
HEATHER
From what?
OLIVER
I know him, luv. He needs a bit of time. He's in a mood.
BARNABY
You seemed in a hurry.
HEATHER
I am. Desperately. Have you written songs? Is there a score? Do you have a tape?
BARNABY
Yes. [He holds a tape up.] Here.
HEATHER
There's a cassette player in the kitchen.
OLIVER
We'll set it up. [He takes BARNABY's arm and leads him towards the kitchen.]
BARNABY
I feel very odd. This island is odd.
HEATHER
Are you frightened?
BARNABY
Not since Jesus.
HEATHER
How can anybody not be frightened? [She sits on the floor next to DANIEL's chair and takes DANIEL's hand.] I wish you could tell me something. Anything. It's not even that I think you're wise, or ever were. I just need you. I can't focus. I don't know what to worry about first. Dylan going to Paris. Dylan upstairs with that girl. Dylan getting nuked. Dylan getting AIDS. Dylan getting religion. The remains of my own system. The world cracking in half. Dylan doesn't think I'm playing with a full deck. When I told him that I worried about the destruction of the rain forests because someday he might wake up without oxygen, he was about to have me committed. I've gotten to the point where I can't even have a meal without panic. I had lunch at an outdoor restaurant last week. I looked at the menu. I could not order eggs because they cause heart attacks. I could not order chicken because they are injected with dangerous antibiotics. I could not order meat because livestock have eaten contaminated grass. I could not order fruit because they have been sprayed with deadly chemicals. I could not order vegetables because the produce in that town looked extra large as though it had mutated from the fallout. I could not order bread because yeast is now thought to damage the immune system. I could not order fish because the waters they swim in are contaminated. I sat there clawing at the menu, crying, laughing, and screaming at the same time, aware that there was one indisputable fact—I was hungry and I didn't know what to do about it. Then I realized I was having this minibreakdown outside, in the afternoon sun, and now that the ozone layer has been destroyed, the afternoon sun is slowly killing us. So I calmed down and had a banana split. What the hell. It's immaterial for me, anyway—I'm here courtesy of chemotherapy. I have only seconds left. But the kids, the kids ... What can they eat? What can they breathe? Who can they sleep with? Sometimes I feel so guilty for bringing Dylan into this mess. Oh shit, Danny, can't you tell me something? You don't care anyhow. Look what you've done to yourself. You know who had the right idea? Mrs. Honey. Mrs. Foster, that is. Crusty old dame. Do you remember her letter? What do you remember? She wrote to us both from India. From Goa. Did you ever read it? I've saved mine. She said her travels finally took her to Goa, and by then she found the entire world was off its rocker, not just America. Someone told her that if you lost your passport in Goa, the police put you into the local madhouse until you could prove who you were. Well, that appealed to her. Amused her. She thought it was the first intelligent thing she had heard in years. So she tore up her passport and retired gracefully—into Bedlam. She's still there. Both her children have died. But she has never been ill, a fact that must seem quite logical in a madhouse. She sends me a postcard every summer. She must send one to you, too. Does Oliver read them to you? She loved being Mrs. Honey. Even though you left out the important stuff. [Pause] I wish you could tell me something, something to make me feel less afraid. [Pause] Anything. [Pause]
DANIEL
Applesauce. [Pause]
HEATHER
Thanks, kiddo. Thanks a lot. I was losing my nerve. I have something to do and I was losing my nerve. But applesauce really helps. I needed that. [HEATHER rises and walks into the kitchen.]
ALIKI
Maps. Ah so. Ah yes. Interesting. [She traces her finger on the map.]
DYLAN
Hey. [He kisses ALIKI—she moves away.] Come here....
ALIKI
Yes?
DYLAN
I leave, like, for the airport in a few hours.
ALIKI
So bye-bye.
DYLAN
Come with me.
ALIKI
I promise to go to Crete.
DYLAN
That creep, like, doesn't even notice you. Why do you want to be with him?
ALIKI
I make promise.
DYLAN
Break promise.
ALIKI
No. I have reason. So I go to Crete. But I leave Crete tomorrow and fly to Athens. I meet you tomorrow in Athens.
DYLAN
Meet me tomorrow in Paris.
ALIKI
No. Athens. Make Paris day later.
DYLAN
I can't. It's business.
ALIKI
Make Paris day later.
DYLAN
Has my mom, like, put you up to this?
ALIKI
No. Your body. [She runs her hand across his chest.]
DYLAN
Jeez!
ALIKI
This is true. You know what we do in Athens?
DYLAN
I think so.
ALIKI
You so sure?
DYLAN
Tell me.
ALIKI
And then ... [She whispers into his ear again.J
DYLAN
What's that?
ALIKI
Greek words.
DYLAN
What do they mean?
ALIKI
You make computer. With languages. Look it up.
DYLAN
This is it. This is my baby.
ALIKI
Look words up.
DYLAN
Say them again.
ALIKI
You make Paris one day later? [Pause] Well?
DYLAN
I'll change the appointment. One day.
ALIKI
We meet at Cafe Homer in Plaka. Six o'clock.
DYLAN
How do I, like, know you'll be there?
ALIKI
I be there.
DYLAN
Yeah, but how do I know?
ALIKI
I prove it to you. Wait.
DYLAN
Hey—Danny . . . there's this thing in your book—I never read it, but that's only because I don't read books, but Mom told me the story and there's this guy who's supposed to be you but he's not really you, although he sort of is, you know, and Mom says he has, like, fears about sex and, like, I thought, hey, that's crazy, nobody's got that no more, but I tell you something—this girl is wild, this girl scares me—I'm over my head, like. You know what I mean?
DANIEL
Don't sneeze.
DYLAN
What?
DANIEL
Don't sneeze.
DYLAN
What's that mean?
DANIEL
Don't sneeze.
DYLAN
What the fuck does that mean?
DANIEL
Don't sneeze.
DYLAN
Maybe I can invent a computer that can translate your mind, huh?
BARNABY
I'm very nerves-orientated.
HEATHER
Pardon?
BARNABY
Scared shitless.
HEATHER
Don't be.
BARNABY
Do you think he'll like my presentations? Will we effect a compatibility relationship? Will he even understand what I'm saying?
HEATHER
Don't worry about it.
OLIVER
[To DANIEL] Here's some fresh orange juice.
HEATHER
Just come with me.
OLIVER
I want you to drink it. You're not getting enough nourishment. Don't give me that glum face.
HEATHER
Danny—this is Barnaby Grace.
OLIVER
Drink the orange juice, luv; don't be difficult.
HEATHER
Mr. Grace is a very important film producer from California.
BARNABY
He's not looking at me.
HEATHER
Doesn't matter. Mr. Grace wants to make a film of "A Table for a King." I've asked him here to speak to you.. ..
BARNABY
I can't tell you what an important moment this is for me, Mr. Hosani....
OLIVER
Will you please drink the juice?
BARNABY
I've wanted to meet you since I was fifteen.
OLIVER
That's a good boy. All down.
BARNABY
I have a deep empathy syndrome with your work.
OLIVER
I think he wants to nap.
HEATHER
He can nap later.
OLIVER
He's tired.
HEATHER
He's not tired.
OLIVER
I don't like his pulses.
HEATHER
I adore his pulses.
OLIVER
He needs a nap.
HEATHER
There's no time,
DYLAN
Mom, maybe he does, like, need to rest.
HEATHER
Shouldn't you be packing for Paris?
DYLAN
Hey! Hey! Hey!
HEATHER
Barnaby is leaving in a few hours as well. It has to be now.
OLIVER
Just a short nap.
HEATHER
No dice.
OLIVER
What's got into you?
HEATHER
Stop protecting him.
OLIVER
I'm paid to protect him. He mustn't hear about this film. It will distress him.
HEATHER
Can't be helped.
OLIVER
What the hell are you doing?
HEATHER
Barnaby is going to tell us about the film.
BARNABY
Well, Mr. Hosani, as I see this project, and I consider it from the very start, a go project... [To HEATHER] He's not looking at me.
HEATHER
He can hear.
BARNABY
My strong point is eye contact.
HEATHER
Trust in Jesus.
BARNABY
Oh.Yes.Well—okay...
HEATHER
But condense.
BARNABY
Yes. Yes.
HEATHER
Condense.
BARNABY
Oh. Yes. I see your book in a positive light. As a life- affirmer rather than a down-in-the-dumpser. And music can help because it's difficult for an audience to focus on a story anymore without a strong soundtrack and a lot of quick images, a lot of fast brain messages, and, of course, you will have a very generous financial cut of the album.. ..
HEATHER
Tell him about Mabel.
BARNABY
Oh. Mabel. Mabel is one of those roles that comes along once in a lifetime.
DYLAN
You never told me about a Mabel, Mom.
BARNABY
Mabel is Mrs. Honey. She needs a first name, and, of course, I've made her younger, about thirty. You see, there have to be a few slight alterations. I've conducted several market surveys on aspects of the plot. Mabel, for instance, will have a very tender romance with David—I have to cut the gay stuff, the market won't hold that post-AIDS—and Jesus is wary of it, anyway—and David's not Jewish anymore, even though Judaism was an initial interest of Jesus, we find there's low audience concern for the subject, so then the waiter who seduces David becomes, of course, a waitress, and that scene is a blessing in terms of soundtrack, all those old sixties hits—but the essence of your story remains exactly the same, even though now it's a young boy who falls in love with a slightly older woman, played by a major star, who he betrays ultimately—and yes, that is the down side—but wait!—the think-positive aspect is that she never gives up her position about the table, which is a lesson to all of us about holding onto our beliefs, this is, in fact, a movie about holding onto our beliefs, and thus a modern parable for the Crucifixion, which was the ultimate hold-on, wasn't it?—and it climaxes in the film in a song that I know will be not just a song but a megasong and, most important, a megasong with a message— which ends with—here ... [He reaches for the tape recorder.] This is the music.... [He switches the tape recorder on—a piano is playing.]
DYLAN
Holy shit.
HEATHER
Danny!
BARNABY
Mr. Hosani—is it a go?
DANIEL
Oysters!
OLIVER
Come on, luv, let's stop this now....
DANIEL
Oysters! I park you. I park you.
OLIVER
It's alright, luv, it's alright....
DANIEL
He is bluesing me; he is bluesing me....
OLIVER
It's alright. .. . Let's take our hands away. ... Let's calm down. ... [He pulls DANIEL away from BARNABY.} That's right. ... That's a good boy. ... Come on, now ... no tears ... [He leads DANIEL to a chair.]
DANIEL
Canasta. Canasta.
BARNABY
There's a tension-factor here I wasn't prepared for.
HEATHER
Don't worry.
BARNABY
Stop telling me not to worry.
HEATHER
You have a deal.
BARNABY
What?
HEATHER
You have a deal. Phone my lawyer when you get back to the States. The book is yours.
BARNABY
Blessed Jesus!
HEATHER
Indeed. But I think you better pack. Get to your boat early.
BARNABY
The Lord's been with me, he's my shepherd, he's clinched my deal....
HEATHER
Please go. Just go.
BARNABY
Okay. Thank you. [He runs off, patting ALIKI on the head as he does so.] Come on, sunshine, we're leaving.
HEATHER
He restoreth my soul. Ha! [She starts to shake—lights a cigarette.]
OLIVER
[To DANIEL] Now you mustn't weep—it's all going to be alright. [He brings over a needle.] I'm just giving you a needle.
DYLAN
Mom, what's wrong with you?
HEATHER
Nothing.
DYLAN
You shouldn't smoke.
HEATHER
You shouldn't go to Paris.
DYLAN
Layoff.
ALIKI
A box for jewels. Mine.
DYLAN
Oh?
ALIKI
I take my bracelet. . .. [She puts the bracelet into the box.] I put it inside. [She removes a ring from her finger. ] And my ring. [She places the ring in the box.] Inside.
DYLAN
Yeah?
ALIKI
And I give to you.
DYLAN
Why?
ALIKI
So you return it to me in Athens. So you know I keep my promise.
DYLAN
I can't, like, take this.
ALIKI
The problem, I think, is not if I meet you in Athens. The problem, I think, is if you meet me. Now you have to. Yes? [ALIKI kisses DYLAN and exits.]
OLIVER
There, that's better, isn't it? That's much better.
HEATHER
Shit, Oliver, did you give him a needle?
OLIVER
Yes.
HEATHER
Will it put him to sleep?
OLIVER
Soon.
HEATHER
But he needs to feel something, even if it's anger. . . . [She goes to DANIEL.] Danny, I've sold your book.
OLIVER
Leave it alone now, luv.
HEATHER
It's going to sing and dance, kiddo. You've invented a Mabel.
OLIVER
Just leave it alone.
HEATHER
That idiot will make hash out of it.
DYLAN
Hey, Mom, maybe he shouldn't hear this.
HEATHER
Danny, the book is bullshit.
DYLAN
Mom ... [He grabs her hand.]
OLIVER
Take her away, Dylan.
HEATHER
Hands off! The book is bullshit. You didn't tell the truth. About the dentist. About the waiter. About you. Too contentious, too political, too blatant, too unpopular. You said an artist has to select. Well, your selections took you right into the pages of Vogue. And no doubt you're right. If Mrs. Honey babbled on about atomic bombs, it would have seemed far too obvious, and she wouldn't have been in the least endearing. And if the waiter had whispered sweet nothings about Marx and Lenin into your ear while you were making love, as he did, instead of singing sixties pop songs, it would have lost its universal touch, I suppose, and the readers would have had to deal with the fact that by the time the book was published that kid was probably in prison being tortured, and that ain't Book of the Month Club, is it? And I know, I know your lies look more like truth than the truth itself, and I know that my way it would actually have been diminished, but Danny, maybe if you had just tried it, Dylan wouldn't be going to Paris today.
DYLAN
Leave me out of this, you hear?
HEATHER
We tell such lies, Danny. Now that idiot is going to take your artful lies and make them artless, that's all.
DANIEL
Ocean.
HEATHER
Yes—ocean—you understand, don't you? I had to do it. For both of us.
DANIEL
Ocean.
HEATHER
For the money.
DANIEL
Ocean.
HEATHER
You forgive me, don't you?
DANIEL
Ocean ... [He closes his eyes.]
HEATHER
Danny, forgive me.
OLIVER
He's asleep, luv.
HEATHER
[Shouts[ Why did you give him that goddamn needle? [She starts to cough and gasp—cannot catch her breath.]
DYLAN
Hey—Mom ...
OLIVER
Let it out, luv.. . .
HEATHER
I'm alright, I'm alright, don't crowd me, leave me alone.... I just can't catch my breath....
DYLAN
Hey, Oliver, I think maybe ... [He signals towards the needles.]
OLIVER
Yes. Good idea.
DYLAN
Come on, Mom, sit down. [He takes her to a chair.]
HEATHER
I've left word with the lawyers. The film will bring in a fortune. It's all going to the right organizations, all of it. It will be written in the contract. The money will go to fight against nuclear energy, against political oppression, against AIDS, against religious extremism—I've spread it over nineteen important groups.. . .
DYLAN
Right, Mom.
HEATHER
I had to do something good with our lives. Everything seems so wasted.
OLIVER
Here, luv, just one ... [He places a needle in her forehead.]
HEATHER
If only I knew how to get to Goa.
DYLAN
It's alright, Mom....
HEATHER
If only I could stop smoking.
DYLAN
It's alright.. ..
HEATHER
Shit... Dylan ... I've done it wrong, haven't I? I've given the money to too many groups. I'm still unfocused. Maybe just two or three. I've done it wrong....
DYLAN
It's alright.
HEATHER
There's just so much to worry about, so much.... [She closes her eyes.j
DYLAN
Sure, Mom.
HEATHER
Ocean.
DYLAN
What?
HEATHER
Ocean ... [She falls asleep.]
DYLAN
Boy, this stuff really works.
OLIVER
It causes a deep sleep for one hour. A very restful sleep. Just one hour. It's cleansing.
DYLAN
Yeah? Hey—do you think? ... Well, I don't have to go to the airport for another two hours. And I'm very tense. [He sits on the floor.]
OLIVER
Only when it goes into the head of a genius.
DYLAN
I mean, what do you think of Aliki?
OLIVER
Don't know.
DYLAN
Danny kept saying something about her.
OLIVER
What?
DYLAN
"Don't sneeze." I wonder what that meant?
OLIVER
Don't know.
DYLAN
I'm tired. Do you think I'll, like, say ocean, too? [He closes his eyes.]
OLIVER
I doubt it, Dylan.
OLIVER
Well, look who's up and about. Feeling better, are we? That's a good boy. Slept well, eh? Four whole days. That's a record for you. Eyes open to take a little nourishment, then back shut into never-never land. Four days.
DANIEL
Apricot.
OLIVER
What?
DANIEL
The apricot is erupting.
WILL
Hi. Can I come in?
JOSHUA
Oh. Oh no. Oh man.
WILL
Happy birthday.
JOSHUA
Nonono. Yes. This is . .. you're kidding me man . . . I—
WILL
Hi Joshua. Can I stay with you? Please? Joshua? it's me. It's really me, yes. I came to wish you happy birthday.
JOSHUA
I—
WILL
Thirty is a dangerous age, yes? I came with a gift. Honest. Can I come in?
JOSHUA
It worked! O man. What do I say? O man.
WILL
It's a very nice gift. I came a long way to bring it. Can I come in? Please?
JOSHUA
Yes. Yes you can. O yes, please.
WILL
And I've brought my toothbrush.
JOSHUA
Oh. That's . . . right. That's ... good.
WILL
Is that—hey ... Joshua! You've finally got a dog! How long have you had a dog?
JOSHUA
Thirteen years.
WILL
What?
JOSHUA
I've had a dog for thirteen years Will.
JOSHUA
You like my little town?
WILL
This little town. Yes. I like it. There's not much to see.
JOSHUA
In the fall, it is heaven. I mean it Will. It is ... heaven. The colors. The trees are red, the light is gold and molten and—yes. Heaven.
WILL
The drive over the mountain.
JOSHUA
Over the hill. Yes. In the dark.
WILL
I didn't like the patch fog.
JOSHUA
It's the cool nights after the hot days.
WILL
It collected in the gulleys. I slowed right down. I couldn't see a yard in front of me and something scared me in the mist it ran across the road in the fog. It was silver.
JOSHUA
A skunk. A raccoon.
WILL
I was scared.
JOSHUA
Then you saw the lights of the town—
WILL
And the lights of the bay.
JOSHUA
—across the water?
WILL
I saw more lights glinting.
JOSHUA
You saw good. Yes. Shimmering. Monterey across the bay— deep and wide / deep blue, dolphins and sea lions. So. How did you find me?
WILL
I tracked you down.
JOSHUA
Why did you find me?
WILL
It took a while and I had to.
JOSHUA
The years have made me that irresistible?
WILL
The years have been difficult and kind. I have so much to tell you. Are you ever—
JOSHUA
No. Never.
WILL
Where are you taking me?
JOSHUA
We'll eat. Somewhere Mexican, chile rellenos. Okay?
WILL
I can't tell you how many nights I craved a—
JOSHUA
Good. I'm glad. We'll have chile rellenos and then we can ...
WILL
Yes, we can, can't we? Talk. Buy some birthday booze—
JOSHUA
Talk. Oh, we'll talk. I've got some things to show you. You could have called.
WILL
I should have. Some whisky? On the way back?
JOSHUA
I said you could have. Don't say should. I hate should.
WILL
It didn't seem urgent.
JOSHUA
Exactly. Don't give me your imperatives, young sir.
WILL
But it was important. Whisky it is. What's that smell?
JOSHUA
Skunk.
WILL
Skunk? No. Sniff.
JOSHUA
What smell? Be precise Will.
WILL
Rich. Tickles the back of your skull.
JOSHUA
Maple. When the sap drips out it smells like the town is one big waffle on a big BIG plate. I have clean sheets for you.
WILL
Will the others mind?
JOSHUA
Others? There are no others Will.
WILL
A dog.
JOSHUA
What did you expect? Really Will, what did you expect?
JOSHUA
So whaddya think?
WILL
O man this is—nothing's changed—you've added to it—couldn't you charge admission!? Are these the original posters? She Creature / Invasion of the Saucermen / Creature from the Black Lagoon—heh heh! Far out! You could start your own business—
JOSHUA
I wanted to.
WILL
What stopped you? Wow. Are those, like, complete sets of Famous Monsters magazine?
JOSHUA
And Castle of Frankenstein and Midi-Minuit Fantastic—
WILL
—Fantastique.
JOSHUA
Yeah. What you said. Complete! More'n you could afford!
WILL
You're morbid.
JOSHUA
No more than you, listening to that smack-voiced drama queen you sang along with—
WILL
Leave Ms. Faithfull out of this. Remember when your haunted house press-book got trashed?
JOSHUA
House on Haunted Hill. And it was the lobby card.
WILL
"You'll fry your brains on that stuff Joshua" "Comic books won't pay the rent"
JOSHUA
Maybe not. They kept me sane tho'. Like you and Marianne. I have videos. Forbidden Planet / The Hills Have Eyes—Blood Feast. Didja ever see Lost Boys?
WILL
Yes! Keifer and Corey. Edward Herrmann—
JOSHUA
—Herrmann! Right! This little town of mine was the location for that movie. That opening ... opening helicopter shot, that's our very own ... my very own boardwalk—
WILL
Let's go see the boardwalk! Let's ride the roller-coaster—
JOSHUA
—log flume, carousel, ferris wheel—
WILL
—salted pretzels—
JOSHUA
—you're interrupting—the powers that be insisted that the movie use a ... fictionalized name ... for the town. It became Santa Carla. Because at that time ... this little town of mine was the bizarre murders capital of the United States and—
WILL
—vampires are bad for business.
JOSHUA
Well exactly. Very bad for business. Because they never mind their own ... they want a slice of yours ... your business, see? They see something they like—
WILL
—two boys, for example. Boys crazy for each other.
JOSHUA
—for example. And they want some of that—
WILL
Gimme some of that!
JOSHUA
Gimme some of that!
WILL
So how do they go about getting what they want?
JOSHUA
Suck it / drain it / slurp it out.
WILL
How ... exactly?
JOSHUA
Provoke. Feast on anger. You forget to keep the drawbridge up, and before you know it, they're inside, hacking away, after your liver your pancreas your gallbladder / that's a very tasty morsel.
WILL
Still angry, huh?
JOSHUA
Aren't you? How can you not be? Ya gotta use it... as stealthily as possible. Then ram a wooden spike through their hearts.
WILL
Does that really do the trick?
JOSHUA
When you stake one, perhaps there's some other organ you have to get at. Some secret vampire organ. Pineal. Pituitary. Of course, they only seem to be going for the throat. It's the sex they want. Where the fuck have you been for thirteen years? What the goddamn fuck did you think you were DOING? What the—the—how COULD YOU? I thought you were dead.
WILL
No you didn't.
JOSHUA
Don't tell me what I'm thinking! Stop telling me what I'm supposed to be feeling! I was afraid, I was scared to death, and you left me. There was an estate, there were lawyers, and we couldn't find you. I felt it in here / I'm feeling it now, this ring of hurt in here. Goddamn you, Will.
WILL
What did you do with my comic books?
JOSHUA
What?
WILL
Do you have my comics? My collector's editions? The Man with X-ray Eyes?
JOSHUA
I traded them. You didn't leave me much else.
WILL
Ouch. You need something more to drink—
JOSHUA
Where were you when I was trying to graduate? Why didn't you hear me? And no thank you / no more / no, Will, I'm loaded enough. My frontal lobes are dissolving like snails in sea salt. I hate booze. Why are you doing this?
WILL
I thought you liked getting drunk and getting stoned,
JOSHUA
I nearly died. Fuck. What do you want from me?
WILL
In New York City. I had a professional lunch. With Quentin Crisp. In a diner on East 3rd Street. He ordered two eggs over easy, a side of fries, a side of toast, and jam. Sounds very American. But think about it. A solitary Englishman in retirement, ordering his egg and chips and tea at 5
JOSHUA
They've all announced my dad already dead, unless (they said) he concedes to those pains—o, the state of his heart. Dad stands bandy-legged not yet dead but sad and hurt his face sags within circles of family demand. My father on my right, we cower—we two before my mother's sudden startled corpse and my brother has gone,
I 
we're cowed by her body. I refuse this.

its death pulses, blood settling in deep places, her skin draining, eyes turning to yellow parchment, and her piss drenching the cold sheet. And at long last I give my dad a hand to hold and he grips as a baby grips a finger. I wait for him to cry. For months thereafter
E
Dad's heart snaps he dies in terror and pain I hear his heart make a great crack. He looks as if, inside his skin, many fingers grip his bones. Is this the heart I inherit? After the last shout in the dark— telling ourselves that life goes on, theirs and ours, and listening for a whimper in the night, a clue that he's survived the closing of the dark gate? Do you suppose when his heart broke that something escaped, cracked open, and finally let Dad out?
JOSHUA
What are you doing out here? It's a beautiful night, isn't it?
WILL
A little better. I want to take my shirt off—
JOSHUA
—are you hot?
WILL
I'm warm. Help me.
JOSHUA
What will people think, I wonder. Me here half loaded with a half-naked man—
WILL
They'll think, why does he do things by halves?
JOSHUA
What's that?
WILL
What's that what?
JOSHUA
That.
WILL
Someone put a knife through it.
JOSHUA
Fighting again.
WILL
Feel it.
JOSHUA
Bumpy.
WILL
It still hurts. It never healed properly. I held the skin together.
JOSHUA
Like that li'l bird we had? That held its broken leg together till it healed?
WILL
Yep. See? I'm learning to be a good animal.
JOSHUA
I nearly died. While you were away.
WILL
While I was out?
JOSHUA
Yeah. Did you feel it?
WILL
No. Should I?
JOSHUA
I called for you. As hard as I could. Guess my heart wasn't in it.
WILL
Maybe you should've used the phone.
JOSHUA
Yeah right / you were so easy to locate—
WILL
Why have you made your bedroom the same as the one in Omaha?
JOSHUA
My room. My room was the safest place I ever had, Will. So safe. Me and the movies inside my head, rescuing myself. Then you joined me. In here. We've been to some places, haven't we?
WILL
Better 'n any I've been to. The best places are in there. Here.
JOSHUA
You could have made a new home with me.
WILL
No. This is like every small town anywhere in the world. They're all the same. And the folks who move to the cities, the same, they turn the city into another small town, treading the same paths every day, taking their address books and transferring names and taking people cut of their lives, the world made smaller by two, and three, and fifty, till there's nobody left but the walls and the empty mirrors and the TV and and—you've moved from Omaha to here and nothing's changed. It's the same room.
JOSHUA
One fucking postcard Will. One. What possessed you? I had to graduate on my own, I—
WILL
I missed you—
JOSHUA
I lied. I just lied. I didn't graduate. O, you got to graduate like a good boy. Daddy's best boy. Then you got the hell out. Mom and Dad dying on us and you fuck off to tell the world what a wonderful place it is / tell us all how happy joyous and free we all are since the sixties made it okay to fuck ourselves to death. After Mom died I had eighteen months of Dad and me / and then I had twelve years of me and my dog / and the two of us coped. And I got laid about once a year. And I nearly died.
WILL
Happy birthday Joshua. You're thirty. Happy happy birthday. It's important.
JOSHUA
Why is it?
WILL
Saturn return. Hell, who knows? It just is. You can't sweep your side of the street without me. Because. What's your dog called?
JOSHUA
Tyler. Hey boy. Woof. Hey hey / who's this
WILL
—"help your mother with the chores!"
JOSHUA
"What's wrong with you!"
WILL 
"Look what you're doing to your mother!"
WILL
—"you never smile."
JOSHUA
—"so goddamn serious."
WILL
Hey HEY .. . Josh ... "TAKE IT BACK WHERE YOU FOUND IT!"
JOSHUA
—right back where you found it. He needs me he wants me see his tail wag when I touch him see his tongue kiss my cheek / can I keep him please he needs me see he loves o he loves me
JOSHUA
"Can't you see what you're doing to your mother!" Fuck Will /1 hated him I hated her.
WILL
She did her best
JOSHUA
IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH. Hey hey try this
WILL 
"You're going to church whether you like it or not."
JOSHUA
I said no and he hit me. Look. He hit me / see it? / Still.
WILL
Let me keep him please so small so scared he wags his tail when he sees me he needs me / he needs me he's so smart he's so cool he wags his tail when he sees me—
JOSHUA
Bastard. Bastard. Goddamn you, you fuck... you fuck! My head it hurts and my heart I cannot feel my heart he wagged his tail when I stroked him his tongue was wet and he licked me his nose was wet and he kissed me O Will. Touch me. Touch me.
WILL
Joshua?
JOSHUA
Okay. Okay. Tyler. It's okay. I'm okay.
WILL
Joshua? Do you want your gift now? I brought you a copy of my book.
JOSHUA
It's okay Tyler. I'm okay.
WILL
I dedicated it to you.
JOSHUA
I know Will. I read it.
WILL
Oh.
JOSHUA
I bought it. Here. In town. I actually paid good money for it.
WILL
Didja like it?
JOSHUA
Um ... I liked the piece on Marianne Faithfull. I quite liked the stuff about Quentin Crisp, even if I didn't get your point. But—okay—what's with all the spiritual shit? You're deluded man. The bathhouses were a religious experience? Will, you've gotta get your head out from between your legs. The tip of your little dick is not God Almighty! Okay, okay . . . lemme see . . . okay listen ... "—in the deep abysmal dark—"
WILL
—Abyssal.
JOSHUA
—abyssal!? Oy. "Deep abyssal dark of the backrooms, there is no class no caste no social structure, no masks, no suits and ties to remind us of our professional contracts, there's just the sheer animal ecstasy, the dissolving of walls and boundaries until it seems the orgasms we share are spilling across the night— sex has freed us to find our way home—"
WILL
And?
JOSHUA
Oh please.
WILL
I'm not judging. I'm an observer.
JOSHUA
Bullshit upon bullshit. Anyone can sit on the sidelines passing judgment, Will. Anyone!
WILL
Okay. Isn't that what you're doing to me?
JOSHUA
No Will, I'm not. This is passion. This is heart. John Preston, Edmund White, Paul Monette, and you. Completely enslaved to your dicks but nononono, what's really happening, brothers and sisters, is that I'm a master of kundalini yoga and I have freed myself from all physical laws! Yeah right! You couldn't deal with all the passion in our bedroom, our own safe place in the dark ... o fuck you man! I have more ecstasy running on the beach with my dog than you ever had with a throatful of dick. You wouldn't know ecstasy if it came up and bit you on the fucking ass, man!
WILL
It has. And I do. Come here.
JOSHUA
Vampire. I'm amazed you haven't shacked up with Madonna yet.
WILL
What's wrong with you?
JOSHUA
Barely two Τ cells to rub together.
WILL
Aw ... Joshua.
JOSHUA
Aw me no aws, big brother.
WILL
How?
JOSHUA
How? How?
WILL
I mean—
JOSHUA
Blood to blood / juice to—o, read the pamphlets. There's one drawback. Just one. Horror movies aren't fun anymore. Apparently they're all metaphors for who I am. Or I'm a walking metaphor. I have a bullet with Susan Sontag's name engraved on it.
WILL
I'm ... fine.
JOSHUA
So am I.
WILL
I mean I.. .
JOSHUA
Well of course. Here's Joshua the homebody at the hearthside with his dog and his slippers, and big bro Will is out cruising the planet banging everything that moves, and you'll live until they have to take you out and shoot you. And I'll be dead.
WILL
I didn't—I don't—
JOSHUA
You'd fuck a woodpile on the chance there was a snake in it.
WILL
That's a good one. Yours?
JOSHUA
No. I stole it. Night Moves. Arthur Penn.
WILL
's good. Crap. But clever. Are you okay?
JOSHUA
Oh yeah! I bounce back. I'm made out of Flubber. Boing boing boing.
WILL
You nearly died.
JOSHUA
Nearly. Life has been quite wonderful since. This friend in my blood is the best thing that ever happened to me. There's no point minuetting around anymore. If I love someone, I'm gonna make sure they know it. That's why I called you here.
WILL
Gonna tell me to get lost or that you love me?
JOSHUA
I adore you.
WILL
O.
JOSHUA
O. Wanna run? Uh-oh. The wabbit wants to wun. Doesn't it. Mom. Dad. Me. Uhoh another one's dropping off the perch. Another night howling at the moon grieving grieving nuhuh—Well. I'm gonna die. You're gonna die. I have the edge on you tho'. And it's really quite ... cool.
WILL
I don't believe in God Joshua.
JOSHUA
What's the rottweiler got to do with it? Oh, stop being so fucking Christian, Will. Didn't do Mom much good either.
WILL
I'm not.
JOSHUA
But y'are Blanche Y'ARE. Put your shirt on Will. Please. Is she nice?
WILL
Who?
JOSHUA
Marianne Faithfull.
WILL
Yes.
JOSHUA
I thought she must be.
WILL
Why?
JOSHUA
People who've nearly died. You either turn crazy with fear, or you become unbelievably cool.
WILL
Like you.
JOSHUA
Like me.
JOSHUA
So, what're ya gonna do now?
WILL
Hair of the dog?
JOSHUA
No, I feel really cramped and poisoned. I mean do next.
WILL
I'll work something out. Use my imagination.
JOSHUA
That's a given.
WILL
What's wrong with what I've been doing?
JOSHUA
What have you been doing?
WILL
Enough.
JOSHUA
So why're you here, Mr. Enigma?
WILL
I told you.
JOSHUA
I think we have a li'l communication problem here, I'm not asking how're you gonna make a living. Or how are you intending to live your life. I mean
WILL
What's your threshold?
JOSHUA
I need you. All the time. It's no fun without you.
WILL
What do you do next?
JOSHUA
You. I want you. Like the old days, like the new days.
WILL
Are you out of a job?
JOSHUA
I don't want money, Will. I have money. This is the coolest town in California, and that's saying something. They look after people here. Now that's community. I have my medical insurance paid for and I have cool doctors, and you can't move for acupuncture needles and rolfers and aura masseurs, this town is the home of woowoo out there stuff.
WILL
Not exactly vampire city.
JOSHUA
I didn't say that. This is one place they haven't colonized. They can't. Unless you invite them in. And I don't.
WILL
What would you have done—if I hadn't shown up? For your birthday?
JOSHUA
Ah, now that's a very interesting question, see, the situation—
WILL
—You want more coffee?
JOSHUA
Yeah. The situation would not have arisen. I willed you here, Will. And my head's sure paying the price. Will, booze makes me very ill. Please don't bring it into the house again.
WILL
How many happy returns do you have left?
JOSHUA
—Hi! How're you today? Yeah, sure was a rough night, .. thanks ... thanks. I love her hair. Big hair! You know, you haveta have big hair if you want to sling hash in a diner—
WILL
Big hair?
JOSHUA
Yeah! You know what they say—the higher the hair, the closer to god! And you know, you know ... it's so important to smile at the waitresses in the diner. Any diner.
WILL
You figure?
JOSHUA
I know so. Look. I'm driving through town. And there's a kid, with his mom, at the crosswalk—I wait for them to cross. He's about four. And he's draggin' behind and I wave at him. He just can't take his eyes off me and his mom is puliin' him along, she's ... oblivious. And he ... his eyes are pleading ... not to his mom ... to me ... "Wait! Wait for me! I'll catch you up! Wait? Please."
WILL
That's why we have to smile at servers in diners?
JOSHUA
He recognized himself. Don't you get it? It's so simple. It's—it's—okay okay, I've got it.. . remember the guy at the gas station? When we were kids. In the back of the car, Sunday drive with Mom and Dad, uuugh! The guy filling his car, watching the counter on the gas pump ... blue jeans, no shirt and you and I... both did that—oh—OH ... inside?
WILL
I didn't think you saw. I thought you weren't looking—
JOSHUA
Everyone was looking, Will. Straight guys were looking.
WILL
I mean looking at me—
JOSHUA
I wasn't. I just knew. And that feeling wasn't... down here ... it was ... heart. Reaching out to ... fold him in ...
WILL
Smiling at waitresses?
JOSHUA
A woman sees me on the street, I hardly notice her ... but I remind her of her son who went off to Vietnam and never came home.
WILL
What's. Your. Point?
JOSHUA
The boy who bags my groceries at Safeway, the woman at the checkout, oh Will, don't you get it don't you see, we're all connected, we're family. Whether you like it or not.
WILL
Joshua, I don't think people are very nice.
JOSHUA
But we have our moments. Will, you're an observer, you watch the patterns moving around so you can go write a thesis on the great kaleidoscope of life, and maybe you can sneer a little if that corner of the pattern is a teeny tiny bit off-color. Just a bit. .. mawkish. A bit too heavy on the underscoring, so ... overemotional. Will, that's not good enough. Too easy. We can't just watch the parade, taking notes so we can tell everyone how they could do it better. We have to get up and march. You've got to PARTICIPATE.
WILL
I ran away. Look at me running. San Francisco, the Embarcadero, the dykes in green body paint shimmying down the avenue. Then an hour at the street party staring at the street drummer, the sweat drips from his chest, soaked leather loincloth
JOSHUA
Look Will, when the waves pull back, the sand looks green as jade. Each footprint holds light / like walking on a mirror / can you hear the sea lions under the wharf, barking all day and night, desperate to be fed?
WILL
Whaddya think Josh?
JOSHUA
About?
WILL
Are you scared you're gonna die?
JOSHUA
Not at all.
WILL
You get angry when you're scared.
JOSHUA
I'm not scared. I'm frustrated. I have so much to do.
WILL
I want to—I want ... I want to be in love with you again, I think / I—I missed you so much.
JOSHUA
A call would have been nice. A letter. Something to tell me who you were ... being. Becoming. I had to imagine. I hoped you were turning into someone I'd want to go on loving. What if you'd become someone I wouldn't want to look in the eye? You never replied to a single card.
WILL
You read what I've been thinking. And you don't approve.
JOSHUA
I had to get very New Age about it. Try and vibe you at a distance. Ask my angel to go talk to your angel. Let's go down there—
WILL
Down where?
JOSHUA
The steps down the cliff there. To the beach.
WILL
Can we take the dog there? Is it allowed?
JOSHUA
Where is the dog? Tyler? O fuckit now what's he eatin'? Hey! Tyler! Drop it! Drop it! O wait here a second Will—
WILL
Where was he?
JOSHUA
In the bushes. Here boy! Good boy! O ... very interesting activities in the bushes today. ... See that guy in the grass? Over there, the long grass like wheat? Under the burned trees ... the cypresses ... that guy! Whoops! There he goes again, going under!
WILL
What's he doing?
JOSHUA
Buck naked, in the grass, with a hard-on? Figure it out! Look! There he is again! Say hi! HI!
WILL
Is this a cruising spot?
JOSHUA
Uh ... It sure seems like it. Look at the scenery today, o mymymy o my. 1 once . . . come on Will, this way .. . Tyler, Tyler, come! I once ... back in the country, I was on a farm one summer, about two years after you left and I took a real vacation in the country and . .. this way .. .
WILL
That guy up there on the lookout. . . man. Will you look at that—
JOSHUA
Hey—listen. I went out into the fields one day, and the dog was such a bundle of puppy energy, we wandered into big fields of wheat, it was honey-colored, waving, like thick animal fur in a strong breeze, and the dog just blended into all that limitless....
WILL
Is he looking at us? I think he's checking you out—
JOSHUA
Naw ... he's here every day. Probably goes home to a wife and kids.. .. O Will for god's sake he smokes.
WILL
So?
JOSHUA
Like, how totally uncool guy—listen, I went into the field and . . . and I wanted to ... get to know ...
WILL
—that guy on the beach. Gray shorts. A young Robert de Niro, with muscles . . . Joshua? Go on.... I'm listening, what were—
JOSHUA
—Forget it / it's not important—
WILL
I want to hear what you've been—
JOSHUA
Okay it is important. Not here. Not now—
WILL
—there are some beautiful bodies on these beaches. Omilord look at the surfers. O my just lookit—
JOSHUA
Aaaaaahhhh! I'm glad you came. Answered my call.
WILL
I hate to disappoint you. I was speaking at UC Berkeley. And I never had the slightest doubt about your location—
JOSHUA
—and you, the traveller who never changed his address—
WILL
I bet you were in the auditorium somewhere—
JOSHUA
—No. I had a couple of spies there. You're still at it. Same old dangerous superannuated pederast crap.
WILL
—and you're in the phone book. So it was very easy to find you / you made it very easy—and the endless calls from lawyers of course.
JOSHUA
—trying to find out where to send your college fees, your interest checks, your—
WILL
Do you need help? Let me help. Are you sure you have health insurance—
JOSHUA
—I don't want your money, Will. I gave it over to you in the first place. Isn't that what Dad would've wanted?
WILL
He didn't want you to be on welfare and wanting for a good doctor's—
JOSHUA
I'm not on welfare. And I am cared for. By the community.
WILL
Pederast crap?
JOSHUA
You and your writer friends.
WILL
Ah. The Ivy League literary boys. I wouldn't call them friends. I might say professional colleagues—
JOSHUA
Edmund White and Paul Manette and—
WILL
What? Hardly—
JOSHUA
If there were a sex politics crime tribunal, Edmund White would be first up in the dock.
WILL
Where'd you pull that one from?
JOSHUA
I want to talk to you. Make sure you GET IT.
WILL
What has Edmund White to do with it?
JOSHUA
Right! And what has Quentin Crisp done to deserve it? Haven't Marianne Faithful! and Patti Smith and kd lang been through enough without your . .. iconographing...
WILL
Is that like pornographing?
JOSHUA
See? See? You're doing it—
WILL
What's Edmund White got—
JOSHUA
That's why I called you.
WILL
You didn't call me / you didn't summon me by incantation.
JOSHUA
Yes I did!
WILL
I'm selling my book, turning up on the campus circuit, hoping my agent can swing me a slot on Larry King Live in the same segment as Joan Collins and I have to be charming because I want my book to sell... and while I'm in the Golden State I think, "I know—I'll look up my little brother whom I miss and—" and there was no mystical summons.
JOSHUA
I ASKED YOU TO COME AND YOU HEARD ME! PLEASE!
WILL
Okay. If that makes you happy. But I'm glad you moved here. I won't be making personal appearances in Omaha.
JOSHUA
That's why I moved here.
WILL
Eh?
JOSHUA
Nothing. Tyler. Come on.
JOSHUA
The trail is marked by a wooden track—
WILL
Rough boards roughly joined—
JOSHUA
—zigzagging thru the ironwoods and eucalyptus and the trees drip sap / at the end of the trail there's a platform surrounded by trees—
WILL
I can hear tree frogs croaking. And butterflies hanging in ... vast bunches, thousands—
JOSHUA
—hundreds of thousands of butterflies resting on their migration south, monarchs, red ripe wings—
WILL
—the woods are shimmering—
JOSHUA
—millions of butterfly wings fluttering—
WILL
—the tops of the trees are scarlet—
JOSHUA
—bleeding
WILL
—wow.
JOSHUA
Cool, huh? Would you want to leave? When heaven is right here?
WILL
What?
JOSHUA
Are you in love?
WILL
No.
JOSHUA
Do you have a lot of sex with a lot of men?
WILL
.. .Yes.
JOSHUA
That hurts.
WILL
Why don't you like my books . .. really?
JOSHUA
You never write about me. Us.
WILL
How do I do that?
JOSHUA
Simple. You just get honest. Get real. Tell the story.
WILL
I do.
JOSHUA
Yeah, I listen to your Reports from the Frontline on Public Radio. In the trenches with HIV. You don't understand the first thing about it.
WILL
I'm an observer after all, eh? Okay?
JOSHUA
The politics of rationalization—
WILL
I'm apolitical Josh—
JOSHUA
Send for the debating team, the great moderator's here—You are a queer who is in love with his own brother and you are apolitical! Every word you write is politics! When you stand in front of an auditorium full of gold-Master-Card-carrying dreadlock-wearing rasta-wanna-be middle-class white kids, you are being political!
WILL
You could have had it too.
JOSHUA
I don't want it—I never wanted it.
WILL
You can still... let me help—
JOSHUA
I don't want your money. I make out on my own.
WILL
—in fact, once you find a subject you want to study, your attitude will change, you'll become more involved—start meeting a whole new set of people—
JOSHUA
—I am involved—with it ALL—
WILL
—and your Τ cells will start responding and—
JOSHUA
I don't want to go back to school. University has made you so STUPID!!!!
WILL
Then what do you want?
JOSHUA
I want to open a rescue center.
WILL
That takes money. Do you want a hospice or is it just for street kids? Let's do some preliminary budgeting—
JOSHUA
You don't get it you don't get it you—
WILL
Don't look wounded. I love you. You'll always be my brother. But I'm not in love with—
JOSHUA
William. I want to open a rescue center for dogs. A no-kill no-turnaway rescue farm. And find homes for them.
WILL
O like for greyhounds. There's plenty of those places already. Why don't you volunteer—what's that?
JOSHUA
Ah, the great American tradition of volunteerism! So, am I to be a thousand and one points of canine light all by myself? Did you vote for George Bush?
WILL
I don't vote. Is this dead?
JOSHUA
It got too cold. They can't get airborne if they don't warm up.
WILL
A frog will get it. A bird.
JOSHUA
You are a predator.
WILL
Like the movie? Of course. Silly me.
JOSHUA
Exactly like the movie. Camouflaged in the trees. Hiding out in the ivycovered walls of cheap shit Euro-imitation universities. You're American, Will, stop trying to be high European.
WILL
Do you even have a passport?
JOSHUA
Just what we need! Another well-heeled queer roaming around Paris and Rome, bleeding all over the Acropolis, shacked up in Barcelona to write out the great grief-struck sunsets on the Golden Horn—
WILL
Cape Sounion actually. You should get your facts right. Before you start—
JOSHUA
You and Paul Monette. You and Edmund White. Platinum-card-carrying globetrotters.
WILL
I couldn't be keeping better company. Excuse me that these guys aren't working for Roger Gorman. Not scripting Chopper Chicks in Zombie Town. How out of touch can I be, forgive me—
JOSHUA
Those guys you interviewed for your book, you slept with? Those guys in the bars? Ohhh ... but that's okay. It's okay... it's all research! Isn't it?
WILL
Scared of dying. Don't be. I'm here for you—
JOSHUA
Ivy Leaguers lusting after blue-collar boys and working-class lads. ... You'll be writing about noble savages next—
WILL
Those blue-collar boys get plenty out of it. They get to say they fucked a celebrity—
JOSHUA
How very Geraldo!
WILL
I've heard a whole posse of men brag how they slept with Tennessee Williams—
JOSHUA
But they're not writing books about it claiming it was a PEAK SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE! Tantra! Sex and fucking Zen! Christ! Let's all blow the factory boys and claim we're tickling God's right testicle!
WILL
So. Am I on the shelf marked fraud, with all the best, the most accomplished gay writers, all of us grade/for fake—
JOSHUA
Best? "One proposal that sounds reasonable to me would be to lower the age of consent to twelve, regardless of the age of the older partner"—
WILL
I never wrote that.
JOSHUA
It's there in your book. In your interview with Edmund White. Why are you giving him a platform?
WILL
I don't censor. I observe. And I'm not about to pass moral judgment on perfectly intelligent and creative human beings just because you want me to—
JOSHUA
You could take a stand. Either way, I don't care! At least have an opinion—
WILL
Omigod! Look at 'em go! Why are they ail freaking out like that?
JOSHUA
BUTTERFLY PANIC!
WILL
Isn't nature amazing—
JOSHUA
It's all we've got.
WILL
Where'd you go? Where've you been?
JOSHUA
The boardwalk.
WILL
Ο. I was worried. Busy?
JOSHUA
Nope. Alpine chair ride dangling empty, skeletal roller-coaster. Weirdest thing, carnivals without people. Ocean like steel. And fog on the water. Like the movie. The movie? John Carpenter? Think Adrienne Barbeau! "I oughta warn someone! The fog is comm! Aiee! The fog is comin!" Flee! Flee! Ow! Then that ankle thing happens ... why do they do that? I've never seen a real woman do that, have you? Imagine growing up thinking that's all you can do—run for your lives!—Then that ankle thing happens ... the fog is comin'! So I'm talking to myself, the way you do ... okay okay, to be honest with you, I was talking to Oprah Winfrey. Do you ever do that? She's so easy to confide in, isn't she? You wouldn't think tens of millions of television viewers were watching. Oprah and me, we're real close. Like that, me an' Oprah. Oh yes. I call her 'Prah, Oh, we're very very close, but I do wish she'd settle. She's big she's small she's big she's small, honey, just pick on a size and settle! You'll be beautiful whatever you choose honey. And oh, oh, don't even get me started on Steadman. So where was I? 'Prah and me, we're discussing this and that and the thing is, 'Prah is so straight-friendly. Oh yes. She has so much time for straight people. And I say, "Well now 'Prah. The thing is, I have nothing against straight people. Oh no! Some of my best friends are straight! I think the man who does my hair is. I mean, shake any family tree, a couple of straights are gonna tumble out. But 'Prah honey ... well, would you want your daughter marrying one? I mean ... they move in next door, then another couple move in, soon the whole neighborhood's going straight and then what happens? They go and build a Kmart! It's true! They do! But I have nothing against them ... in their place. The thing is 'Prah, the thing is ... I just don't... I don't... look, I just don't think straight people should be teaching in our schools. There! I've said it! And I don't care!" And then Will, this is amazing, then it was as if. . . well suddenly I was talking to god. Just like ... snap, there she was!
WILL
What did she look like?
JOSHUA
A rottweiler. With big hair ... so I asked "Why doesn't it work when I piss in the yard to keep out the raccoons at night?"
WILL
Different acid-alkaline balance.
JOSHUA
God speaks. Hey.
WILL
Oh, get serious.
JOSHUA
"I won't grow up I won't grow up"—call me Peter Pan. Be my Wendy Darling.
WILL
No.
JOSHUA
Nana dog?
WILL
No!
JOSHUA
Wow. Sorry Mom. C'mon be a kid with me.
WILL
You have to grow up. Your resentments are childish.
JOSHUA
No, not if it means being a predator.
WILL
We didn't know what we were doing.
JOSHUA
Of course we didn't. Wasn't it great! Thank god I fucked you and not some over-the-hill novelist.
WILL
Everything's changing for a lot of people, very suddenly, they're coming to terms with something frightening. Tragic. Making contexts—
JOSHUA
I'm your brother.
WILL
The stories need telling.
JOSHUA
What about our story?
WILL
So much loss and sadness and—and bargaining with god—
JOSHUA
You're rattling around the world with your tape recorder and your notebook, a Victorian explorer banging in where he isn't wanted—
WILL
I do, I do love you, don't be so sad, don't be so needy—
JOSHUA
The philosophy you're dredging up has nothing to do with being queer! It's just a pack of selfish old men justifying themselves before they die!
WILL
Bitterness and anger are a waste of time. Poisonous emotions, they'll make you sick—
JOSHUA
DON'T you fucking patronize me, you overeducated condescending asshole—
WILL
I really want to help you. Don't get overwrought, calm now. There are medics in the city—
JOSHUA
I never felt better in my life.
WILL
Great! That's great! Fine. That's good. Okay... okay. See, see ... I'm trying to get... look ... history's being made. I don't want another kid to go through this—what you're going through—
JOSHUA
Oh puh-leez! Where are you in your books? These people you talk to ... what do you feel about Mister Burroughs? Do you ever dream about them? What're your secret dreams about Marianne? Could you? Hmmmm? Would you? Hmmmm ...? Bet you could!
WILL
You're turning into a Kmart Walt Whitman knockoff.
JOSHUA
At least I read what you're writing! You should try it sometime. You took the money and ran and left me here in the real world mopping up the mess. You weren't scared of Mom trying to make sense of it all, snorting lines of holy writ, Dad with his pain his his his terror you, you privileged—
WILL
Privilege! I see a soup kitchen on your Main Street Joshua, handing out clothes and food for people with no place else to go, and in the middle of the line there's a bunch of white kids smoking dope, you just know they can call Daddy collect anytime, get another line of credit when they want it—
JOSHUA
Whereas you just waited for him to die.
WILL
See! You want the money, admit it! You want what I have!
JOSHUA
I want you. I just want you to come home.
WILL
Home to what? We didn't have anything.
JOSHUA
Excuse me? We were in love!
WILL
Two brothers diddling with each other in the dark—
JOSHUA
The hell we were! We were two brilliant kids in love—I'd have died rather than give you up and you got scared. Run off to your redbrick university for a course in cerebral detachment, spout Greek love and high culture, blaze off on those vacations in Bangkok and Mykonos, fuck all the natives and head back to the East Coast and write hip essays on high art and low boys—
WILL
Why do you hate me?
JOSHUA
Awww, fuck you, I'm not biting.
WILL
I wanted to see you so bad.
JOSHUA
Gone quick hasn't it?
WILL
What has?
IOS
All these years. See? How quick they go?
WILL
You vomited all over me and my work. Start thinking, brains are for thinking Joshua. Designed for it. Maybe you'd be better off looking after your dogs, this kind of feeling is toxic, you should get help—
JOSHUA
You're terrified, you're terrified of feelings, you can pull the blinds, smoke up a fog and huddle over a bottle of whisky thinking great shivery thoughts. But you'll still be afraid of feeling!
WILL
I feel more passion in one night than you've felt in ten years. I've shared my heart with men in the most beautiful places on earth—
JOSHUA
Oh yeah, clambering around in the bushes playing Heidi the goat girl! Oh, my sexual adventurer. You fuck because you're afraid of feeling and you're afraid of feeling because you love me! It is having no boundaries that is killing us.
WILL
Killing you. With envy.
JOSHUA
I'm very much alive thank you. You're the one who sounds dead to me, ¡ JOSHUA pushes WILL. Pushes again. WILL lashes out. Slams JOSHUA against the wall. Again and again. They fight. Vicious, furious, final JOSHUA falls; WILL pins him to the ground. An exhausted surrender.]
WILL
So. What now?
JOSHUA
I love you and I wanted you to live with me and be my best friend.
WILL
I'm your brother.
JOSHUA
And I want you to sleep with me every night like we used to and pick up our dream where we left off.
WILL
I don't think 1 can.
JOSHUA
Maybe not.
JOSHUA
Ty-lerrr! Ty-lerrr! C'mere boy! C'mon! Over here! so old, Will, so old— Will. First time I walked this path, a deer came across me. A doe. And so silent. Staring right into me, huge eyes, poised, completely poised and still. Staring. As close as this. And then and then—Will, this is the odd . .. the strangest . .. thing, this is weird . . . she teleported.
WILL
No.
JOSHUA
She's staring and and and—then she's not there! Slid into silence so completely .. . merged.
WILL
It's a backdrop, isn't it?
JOSHUA
This?
WILL
The fallen trees, this this ... is this moss? This thick? Ferns, the the ... what is that stuff?
JOSHUA
Sorrel.
WILL
It looks fake. A Disney backdrop.
JOSHUA
A glass painting from King Kong.
WILL
Yeah. I want hot popcorn and cold soda. Lookit that! Looks like sea dragons. And what's that?
JOSHUA
Chipmunk.
WILL
Really? It's a little devil.
JOSHUA
And there are horse trails, Will. It's wonderful. Suddenly a beautiful white horse, ridden by the most beautiful man in the world ... just appears . .. it's a fantasy come true he's come to rescue me at last! "Hi! Where have you been all these years! What kept you!" Come to carry me away ... scoop me up in his arms .. . carry me away ... over the hill ... This is a magic place Will. Some wishes come true before you know you've wished them. Have you noticed ... your breath has changed? Your breathing, Will. Calm and deep. Because of the trees. Two-thousand-year-old lungs.
WILL
So fucking high. The redwoods. So high.
JOSHUA
You can walk inside them.
WILL
No shit!
JOSHUA
I'll take you inside a tree. Round the next corner. Where a lieutenant made his home when he was making maps for the railroad. He lived inside a tree. In 1846.
WILL
No time at all.
JOSHUA
No time at all.
WILL
I need to talk to you.
JOSHUA
So talk.
WILL
I need you to hear me.
JOSHUA
I'm hearing.
WILL
Really hear. I love you Joshua. I love you so much. I missed you. I dreamed you. I had to find you.
JOSHUA
Tyler. Come here, boy.
WILL
I woke up clutching pillows and cried because it wasn't your face I was holding. I ran next to you in the big fields like we used to. In the old days. It was so real. And I woke and it hurt so much I begged god to send me back into my dream. I stared at strange city skylines and I heard your voice. And I turned I saw you yes YES! I smelled you in the evening and in the middle of the night and and and—
JOSHUA
I nearly died.
WILL
I know. Of course I heard you. I hear you all the time. How do you tell anyone this Josh? .. . How do I... you mean everything. I hung around bars and clubs looking for Mister Perfect to show up. The bars close, I'm one of the guys left when the lights are going out. All of us left without partners in the dark, we're looking at one another thinking, he doesn't look so bad. Suddenly he looks ... okay. And none of them were you. I thought I didn't deserve to fall in love.
JOSHUA
I called you. I closed my eyes. Will I want you Will I need you I need you—
WILL
Josh—
JOSHUA
Will. Where the fuck have you been?
WILL
I'm here.
JOSHUA 
So my four feet pad the long miles under moonlight. The sidewalk the dirt road the dry field, so. And so my four legs lollop, great hound that I am! Among my many names, so— watcher and wanderer I know myself to be and WOOF! and WOOF! Now what's this taste this big full earth between my teeth this taste, maggoty and game seeking the roots of my tongue? I trust my tongue I love this nose / my special nose / wet and black staring back at me from moonlight pools sniffing rats and dirt and grass this gorgeous stink floods my head splashes the stones I call my skull the smell is so very so / its smell is radiance I dream I dream my dog dreams of dogness. I pound past dark warehouses and docks skimming in dreams of devotion the days of sticks in full fields and fish drifting in a lake and this longing this longing that keeps me running hounding him down the nights deep in the roots of my tongue and taste my man my man so / my nose to the damp ground my man my man stay where you are—I'll find you. Dirt grass and rats I'll find you— the moon so huge and my heart is squirming and my man so far away.
JOSHUA
I wanted a cuddle more than anything.
WILL
So did I. Do I. Why's it so quiet?
JOSHUA
Earthquake weather. Hot and still. I want to be cuddled. It comes from nearly dying—it's all gravy. It is all a fucking miracle, every moment, and most of what we do to fill the silence isn't really important. You have to smile at the server in the diner. Make small talk with the boy at the checkout.
WILL
And that's your final word on it all?
JOSHUA
That's what it all comes down to ... Paul Monette is a wonderful writer, I think.
WILL
So why do you hate him so much?
JOSHUA
Where's the dog? Where's—Tyler? Tyler!—Oh. There. I wonder what he thought we were doing. I remember once ... you were about sixteen, seventeen, and you came running home from the record store and your eyes were shining and you said "Josh, hey Josh you gotta listen, listen to this!" and you played me "Sister Morphine." Marianne Faithfull. And you said "Listen—not exactly Maria Callas! But listen to the feeling! The feeling!" You were so alive—
WILL
You still haven't answered my question.
JOSHUA
Why do I hate the sultry groves of academe? Because... I can't compete. With them. For you. If you were a baseball legend or a prizefighter I'd hate the team, the coach, the referee, the stadium the ring the ropes in which you were magnificent. If you were a salesman I'd hate the vacuums and the microwaves. But, but you see, I don't hate them, I...
WILL
Yes. You need to understand something. I'm not sure I can tell it right—
JOSHUA
Are you going to start crooning "The Wind Beneath My Wings"?
WILL
And why not?
JOSHUA
Because I'll slap you if you do.
WILL
I envied you then what I envy you now ... your ... wholeheartedness. You still love horror movies, the best people like horror pictures, the best people carry toys in their luggage.
JOSHUA
Oh yeah! My bear's gonna be buried with me.
WILL
You know how to take a walk in the woods. You get the wow-ness of things. I lost it. I don't think I ever found it. And I always believed that if you were in love with me, then you didn't have very good taste.
JOSHUA
Mm. Okay. I became ill quite rapidly. As if I'd been running with open arms to meet... whatever comes next. Then I got well again, up and down ... have you any idea how much effort I put into keeping Dad's business going, as if I had to ... so you could always depend on me if you needed to? ... Then suddenly it was all too much. Bankrupt. And I walked away from the chaos and lo! I haven't been ill... not since.
WILL
What will you—what should I do when you—
JOSHUA
Miss me like crazy. You have to go.
WILL
No.
JOSHUA
You have to. We're part of the same problem. I need rescuing. You can't rescue me. You're part of the problem I need rescuing from—
WILL
From which I need rescuing.
JOSHUA
From. Which. I. Need. Rescuing. See? We keep making the same mistakes, over and over, expecting a different result every time ... and that's insanity. You can't be Mister Blue Jeans at the gas station—I'm not going to die without you.
WILL
I know.
JOSHUA
It'll be so lonely.
WILL
You and your needy dogs. Wagging their tails when they see you.
JOSHUA
Write about me. Please. You must write about you and me. We don't have long lives, and people matter. Tell them. Put it down in your book.
WILL
I'll tell the world how angry you are.
JOSHUA
I'm not angry. I'm frustrated. It's so simple. You gotta get real, big brother. And it'll take that pain away—and you'll live long and happily. I promise.
WILL
I'll be okay.
JOSHUA
Get real. Can't live by codes and passwords. It'll be wonderful. It'll feel like you feel when you stroke a dog.
WILL
That good?
JOSHUA
It'll feel like you feel when you stroke a dog!

BELIZE
That sound, that sound, it... What is that? I'm frightened. Something's coming in here; something's approaching! What is it?
JACOB
Serve, Belize, serve.
BELIZE
She gives you much drama.
PAUL
So when does this angel get to America?
BELIZE
Right then, honeybabychiles. The last Miss Ann Angel
PAUL
Through the ceiling?
BELIZE
If I'm lying, I'm dying.
JACOB
She can't use the front door?
BELIZE
You know white folks. Then everywhere you look feathers, plaster, epiphanies, and roaches.
PAUX
Now who's got to clean all that up?
ALL
Well.,.
JACOB
Paul, Belize, try this cake Miss Raj sent over. She just peed in the frosting.
BELIZE
Jacob, I heard Miss Raj hasn't been feeling well lately. I know she's fed up being on the high school circuit.
JACOB
She's fine. The tea is who she was feeling at Keller's last night.
PAUL
Was she out with George?
JACOB
George out? Girl, you know that tea.
PAUL
Belize, I know what you mean about them trying to find their epiphanies thru us. You see, Missy Guare has me up there with all these Upper East Side most worrisome white folks, processing all their yap-de-yap get-a-clue-already angst. Then I have to feed 'em. Then I have to fuck 'em.
JACOB 
Yuk.
PAUL
Like some kind of Hattie MacDaniels meets Mandingo biotech fruit. Where is my epiphany in that?
JACOB
Six degrees of segregation!
PAUL
Do I look like an anecdote to dine out on to you?
BELIZE
At Denny's. I know girl, 'cause Missy Kushner has me up there every night reading these white kids' asses or wiping their butts. It's all the same to me. In part two I get to wipe Roy Cohn's butt. Find an epiphany in that! Mo' tea?
PAUL
If you don't mind. Jacob, how's La Cage treating you?
JACOB
At least they pretend there's epiphanies in there for you. I'm so over Missy Fierstein putting me through Butterfly French Maid McQueen eight times a week. I can live with the eye bugging and noble caretaker nonsense. But, children, it hurts my pride so bad, night after night, to put on heels and have to walk like the last Steppin' Jungle Bunny Fetchit! [She has a fit of hysteria.]
PAUL 
No training wheels required!
JACOB
Well, at least we have each other.
PAUL
Which you would never know—out there.
BELIZE
But what we gonna do? Quit?
JACOB
Children, it's half hour.

It's been real. Where you at these days?

Thank you.

hairdresser, ballet dancer, or interior decorator. When the Negro is occupied by one of these professions, he is generally discriminated against because he is homosexual and, paradoxically, not because he is Negro.
MISS EMORY
Lights!
MISS EMORY
Cliff, I'd like to have a word with you.
CLIFF
Yes, Miss Emory.
MISS EMORY
Cliff, I'm concerned about you. Last semester you were such a good little student. Attentive. Diligent. Always ready with an answer and a smile.
CLIFF
Yes, Miss Emory....
MISS EMORY
A real role model to all that riffraff they bused in here. The entire faculty hopes you'll be the first one of your people this high school sends to college. And if your grades hold up, I plan to recommend you for the state's Booker T. Washington Scholarship. But this term, Cliff, you seem distant. Distracted. Are there problems at home?
CLIFF
Everything is fine, ma'am, fine.
MISS EMORY
Cliff, a white woman like myself has never been to Shantytown, of course, but I watch television, and I have a good idea what it's like. All those single-parent households. Your mother, does she drink too much? Do you get a balanced diet? All those fried foods can't be good for you! Tell me, Cliff. You can trust me.
CLIFF
My family is okay, Miss Emory. I'm just a little tired lately. Guess I stay up too late hitting the books.
MISS EMORY
[Rubbing his head] Cliff, it's boys like you who will overcome, someday. I want you to know, if you ever need someone to share with—I'm here for you. [She exits.]
MISS EMORY
In men who are uncircumcised there is an unpleasant substance which forms between the penis and the foreskin if it is not washed every day. It is called "smegma" and has an objectionable odor. In men with an unusually long penis who have not been circumcised this warm, moist area under the foreskin can become a breeding ground for germs.
PAUL
Cliff? Cliff. You and Sharnelle going to the big game tonight?
CLIFF
You're putting me on, Paul. We're lucky to be sitting in the same classroom with you.
PAUL
Who's going to stop you?
CLIFF
This school hasn't been integrated long enough to get folks used to the idea of black boys and girls together with white boys and girls. We're not safe out of our own neighborhood at night, and you know it!
PAUL
Come to the game with me and Muffy. They wouldn't dare lay a finger on you. You know who my old man is.
CLIFF
I don't want to talk about fathers.
PAUL
You know, Cliff, you've never said much about your family—
CLIFF
I hate my father! I hate him! He was no damn good. He spent all his money and all Mama's, too, on drinkin' and other women. Then he went off to Chicago. Mama just about killed herself after he left. That was five years ago. That's why I've got to be a doctor, to make my mama proud. I want to help people when they need help. Mama needed help and there wasn't no one.
PAUL
I'm sorry, Cliff. I know it's hard, but give yourself a break. We'll pick you up at 7
CLIFF
You drive into Shantytown in that new convertible of yours and you'll get ripped off! My people aren't welcome on your side of town, and Uncle Charlie's not welcome on our side. That's the way it is, and that's the way it's going to stay for a long time yet.
PAUL
I was just trying to be friendly.
CLIFF
It ain't much use to be friends with someone who ain't the same color. It just don't pay in the end.
PAUL
But how can we change the world, Cliff, if we don't start right here at Walt Whitman High? Let's skip the game and leave the girls at home. I think you and me should take a walk along the river and just talk. Man to man. How's that for a night on the town?
CLIFF
I'd like that, Paul. I'd like it very much.
PAUL
Good. See you at 7
SCIENTIST
Thank you.
PAUL
Hey.
CLIFF
Hey.
PAUL
Glad you made it.
CLIFF
I should be home studying. Mama's gonna get worried.
PAUL
She'll be alright.
CLIFF
So what did you want to talk about?
PAUL
I dunno. What did you want to talk about?
CLIFF
I dunno.
CLIFF
I should get back.
PAUL
Have you and Sharnelle ever done it?
CLIFF
Sharnelle's no tramp! Sharnelie wants to be a nurse. Sharnelle wants to make her mama proud. I want to be a doctor!
PAUL
I've never done it with a girl either.
CLIFF
But you and Muffy are all over each other like white on rice.
PAUL
It's just a show to keep our parents happy. I don't know how to say this, Cliff, but ever since that first day when I saw you step off the bus from Shantytown, I've felt a special closeness to you. The other white kids called you names that day, but not me, Cliff, not me! The only name I've ever wanted to call you is ... friend.
CLIFF
Paul... I don't know what to say.
CLIFF
No, Paul, please don't!
PAUL
Why?
CLIFF
It's all wrong.
PAUL
Look, I don't understand too much about this, but I jack off every night thinking about you.
PAUL
When Miss Emory rearranged the seating and assigned you next to me, I thought I'd blow my nuts. I've always known I was a budding queer, but I never knew I'd get so hung up on a dark boy. But that's what happened, and I decided to do something about it. I'm a real greenhorn when it comes to having sex with anyone, except myself, of course, but at least I know what I want. Maybe afterwards I won't like myself very much ... or even like you, but that's a chance we have to take. How about it?
CLIFF
This is so fast, Paul. Guys shouldn't be doing these kinds of things.
PAUL
I hear it's healthy—
CLIFF
We're from opposite sides of the tracks.
PAUL
I have a car—
CLIFF
What if your father found out?
PAUL
He's a Methodist—
CLIFF
Or my mother?
PAUL
She's a Democrat—
CLIFF
I want to go to med school, Paul. I want to be a doctor!
PAUL
Yeah, baby, you want it. Let me see that licorice stick. I've got some white lightning for you here. Come on!
MISS EMORY
Oh, my god! What are you boys doing there? Stop that! Stop it at once! Pull your pants up. Put those things away.
PAUL
Miss Emory, I can explain.
CLIFF
Please, Miss Emory, don't tell my mama; it would kill her.
MISS EMORY
[To CLIFF] Be quiet! [To PAUL] Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul. You are from a good white family, and I realize that you, like many of us, have often been confused by this integration madness. You be in my office tomorrow morning at 8 A.M., and I won't say a word to your father.
PAUL
Yes, Miss Emory.
MISS EMORY
Go!
MISS EMORY
But you, Cliff. You are such a disappointment to me. They can take you out of Shantytown, but they can't take Shantytown out of you. Trying to corrupt a good white boy like Paul with your perverted ways. I thought you were different, Cliff. I don't see how I could recommend you for the Booker T. Washington Scholarship after this. It will break my heart to tell your mother.
CLIFF
No! [He falls to his knees crying.]
MISS EMORY
A mind is a terrible thing to waste. [She exits.]
PAUL
Don't, Cliff, please. We'll figure something out,
CLIFF
I guess I've just been an experiment to you, haven't I?
PAUL
An experiment? What do you mean?
CLIFF
You just wanted to see what it was like with a black boy, didn't you?
PAUL
It's late, Cliff. We'll talk it over tomorrow.
CLIFF
No. We won't! We won't talk it over tomorrow, or the next day, or the day after that! How can I ride the bus with the other kids? Who'd sit next to the high school homo?
PAUL
Cliff, let me drive you home.
CLIFF
Get away from me! Uncle Charlie and his children never change. I trusted you and you used me. I'm leaving town tonight if I have to hitchhike out of here.
PAUL
Don't, Cliff! I love you. Cliff. I love you.
CLIFF
Love? You can't fall in love with a guy. Get away from me. Go away! Just leave me alone!
SCIENTIST
Thank you.

Bang!
VOICE THREE
Six shots.
VOICE TWO
At close range.
VOICE FOUR
A body falls.
VOICE ONE
Slumped against the urinals.
VOICE THREE
White walls with peeling paint.
VOICE TWO
Cold mosaic floors.
VOICE FOUR
A pool of red.
VOICE ONE
Everywhere splattered with blood.
VOICE THREE
Warm blood.
VOICE TWO
Red patterns.
VOICE FOUR
Flowerlike.
VOICE ONE
Patterns.
VOICE THREE
Slow, moving.
VOICE TWO
Patterns.
VOICE FOUR
Sounds.
VOICE ONE
Tiny, annoying.
VOICE THREE
Sounds.
VOICE TWO
Drips.
VOICE FOUR
From leaky water taps.
VOICE ONE
The dull hum.
VOICE THREE
From the blinding.
VOICE TWO
Fluorescent lights above.
VOICE FOUR
And a boy standing.
VOICE ONE
Breathing hard.
VOICE THREE
Weeping.

Outside,

Traffic sounds.
VOICE ONE
Wailing sirens.
VOICE THREE
The disjointed chorus.
VOICE TWO
Of staccato footsteps.

From street pedestrians.

Hurrying home from work.

Seems distant.

Lingering smells.

Hanging still in the air.

VOICE THREE
Do you know what cottaging is?
VOICE FOUR
Cottaging?
VOICE THREE
Having sex in lavatories.
VOICE FOUR
Sex in the toilets? Eh—no—never heard of it.
VOICE ONE
Cottaging. Why, yes, Τ believe that the term came from the fact that public conveniences were once designed in the style of Swiss cottages. You know, the little white brick cottages with black wooden frames. Very Sound of Music.
VOICE FOUR
Is this Candid Camera?
VOICE THREE
Excuse me, sir. We're doing a documentary on—
VOICE TWO
You're that chap on—
VOICE THREE
Alan White.
VOICE TWO
BBC?
VOICE THREE
Channel Four.
VOICE TWO
Yes, that's it. My, you look a lot smarter in real life. A bit short, perhaps.
VOICE THREE
As I was saying, we're doing a—
VOICE TWO
Well, you've been doing a brilliant job, my lad. The missus and I simply love to watch your juicy news stories at ten.
VOICE THREE
Yes.
VOICE TWO
Sally, the missus, simply raves about your butch travestite curb-crawlers story—top notch—
VOICE THREE
Eh—thank you, sir—
VOICE TWO
And the recent story? On the impact of holiday prices on Fergie? Got me tongue-tied, it did. We stay up for you, Alan.
VOICE THREE
Yes. We're here to conduct interviews for a television documentary—
VOICE TWO
And you want my opinion.
VOICE THREE
Yes and—
VOICE TWO
My, I'm going to be on telly. Wait till Sally hears about this. Me on BBC.
VOICE THREE
Channel Four.
VOICE TWO
It's still telly, isn't it? What's the topic this week, Alan?
VOICE THREE
Toilet sex and we're wondering if—
VOICE TWO
I beg your pardon.
VOICE FOUR
Oh blimey, sure I've heard of it. Seen it even. In Notting Hill—at some of the private clubs, even at parties. There're blokes who'll have a quick shag with girls in the toilets. Yeah—I've seen it. It's really kinky—-sexy.
VOICE ONE
Yeah, but I'm not sure. Once I went to the loo in Clapham Common. Yeah—it was in the afternoon; maybe it was evening. I went in to take a quick piss—
VOICE TWO
Cottaging? No, never heard of it.
VOICE ONE
Well, there was this geezer standing there. He's just standing there. Like he's taking a piss or something. For a long time. And all the time he was looking in my direction. Looking at me.
VOICE FOUR
I don't think it's true. The graffiti you read on the toilet walls like "This bloke gives good head—meet at this place—this time." And the phone numbers. I think it's all—you know. It couldn't be—I don't know.
VOICE ONE
He kept pulling on—his—you know—looking at me. Then all of a sudden, another geezer came into the loo, and he started staring at this new geezer.
VOICE TWO
Sure, I know what it is. Saw Prick Up Your Ears.
VOICE ONE
He's still doing the business like—and this new chap looked back at him and walked into a cubicle. And the geezer who was clocking me just walked right in after him, wallop.
VOICE THREE
Have you ever participated in toilet sex?
VOICE FOUR
Piss off. What the fuck do you think I am? Fucking queer?
VOICE TWO
Yeah, I got my cock sucked off a couple times before.
VOICE ONE
It's a bit fucking bright, isn't it?
VOICE THREE
That's TV for you, sorry. Right. Dr. Worthing, can you sign this release before we tape?
VOICE ONE
This is exactly the way we discussed.
VOICE THREE
As I said to you a few days ago, I would like the Channel Four news team to be first in London to broadcast the Lee murder documentary.
VOICE ONE
I don't give a fuck whether you're the first or last. I want to know if this is exactly what we spoke.
VOICE THREE
We will say we got this interview from you after the trial.
VOICE ONE
That's all I want to know. And to protect myself—
VOICE THREE
We agreed that if you feel there's anything unethical about disclosing certain privileged information, you needn't answer the questions.
VOICE ONE
And you want me to—
VOICE THREE
Recount your daily dealings with your client since we don't have access to him.
VOICE ONE
And the money?
VOICE THREE
One thousand pounds will be sent to you after the broadcast.
VOICE ONE
Before.
VOICE THREE
I beg your pardon.
VOICE ONE
I want the dosh before you air the piece.
VOICE THREE
This is not what we discussed.
VOICE ONE
Then I'll walk. I'm sure there are other news shows which will want first dibs on this story.
VOICE THREE
Before the piece, then.
VOICE ONE
Hey, why are you looking so bloody forlorn? You'll finally get the ratings your show needs and get yourself some fucking credibility.
VOICE THREE
Can we start, Dr. Worthing?
VOICE ONE
It's your money.
VOICE THREE
Do you—I'm sorry, I'm afraid we've got you in a medium shot and if you won't fidget so. Let's start again. Dr. Worthing, tell us about the case you've been working on.
VOICE ONE
The case I've been working on—
VOICE THREE
The Lee case.
VOICE ONE
Oh, right. John Lee, the murder in Bethnal Green. Right, of course, yes—uh—I believe I was asked by the court—
VOICE THREE
You're a—
VOICE ONE
Criminal psychologist. I'm on the case to determine—
VOICE THREE
To determine whether he was sane or insane at the time of the—
VOICE ONE
The murder—yes. The defendant wasn't able to afford counsel and—
VOICE THREE
Yes, we know that.
VOICE ONE
Listen, if you know so fucking much, why are you interviewing me?
VOICE THREE
I'm sorry, Dr. Worthing. I'm just fishing for particular sound bites.
VOICE ONE
Wouldn't it be simpler for everyone here if you gave me a bloody script instead?
VOICE THREE
Tell me about him.
VOICE ONE
Well, he's just finished his A levels—waiting to go into university in Cambridge. He's nineteen—that's all I can say on the record.
VOICE THREE
Dr. Worthing, this is a rather personal question. I have some contacts in the public prosecution sector, and they tell me that you are one of the least liked criminal psychologists in the business. Some of them claim that this is possibly your last assignment given your poor track record in the recent year.
VOICE ONE
I beg your pardon?
VOICE THREE
Let me also add that they also said you are unprofessional, rude, and inconsiderate towards your clients. Some even go so far as to say you drink excessively, arriving late to sessions and not even showing up at all.
VOICE THREE
There are also rumors about the sexual harassment of your female colleagues and coworkers.
VOICE ONE
I have no—
VOICE THREE
According to your peers, you constantly use profanities during counselling sessions? Isn't it unorthodox?
VOICE ONE
Yes, but—
VOICE THREE
Unprofessional, irregular, and rude are the adjectives I have received from—
VOICE ONE
Oh, for fuck sake—
VOICE THREE
Exactly what I mean. Dr. Worthing, am I safe enough to presume that all these allegations are true?
VOICE ONE
No.
VOICE THREE
I'm sorry, Dr. Worthing; we didn't get that.
VOICE ONE
No. It's not true.
VOICE THREE
Once again, Dr. Worthing, audio—
VOICE ONE
It's not true.
VOICE THREE
Thank you, Dr. Worthing. I just want to clear the air before we ask further questions about the Lee case. I have no more questions at this time. Stop tape.
VOICE TWO
John standing.
VOICE THREE
In the toilet stall.
VOICE FOUR
Nervously.
VOICE ONE
Looking.
VOICE FOUR
Waiting.
VOICE THREE
Aman walks slowly.
VOICE TWO
Into the stall.
VOICE THREE
Cramped.
VOICE ONE
In his late thirties.
VOICE THREE
Balding.
VOICE TWO
A trim beard.
VOICE THREE
Wears glasses.
VOICE ONE
Clonish.
VOICE THREE
They seem to be talking.
VOICE TWO
A little.
VOICE FOUR
"Hi."
VOICE ONE
John nods.
VOICE TWO
The clone wets his lips.
VOICE THREE
Slowly.
VOICE FOUR
Knowingly.
VOICE TWO
John's eyes make a quick study.
VOICE ONE
Of the man's body.
VOICE FOUR
His eyes.
VOICE TWO
Transfixed.
VOICE THREE
Touching his body.
VOICE TWO
His trembling hands.
VOICE ONE
Run down the stranger's body.
VOICE FOUR
Unevenly.
VOICE TWO
Nervously.
VOICE THREE
The man holds John's head.
VOICE FOUR
And leads John down.
VOICE TWO
To his swelling crotch.
VOICE ONE
His face against the soft denim.
VOICE THREE
A faint, familiar smell.
VOICE TWO
Smells of soap and sweat.
VOICE ONE
The man's head arches slowly.
VOICE FOUR
Leans on the toilet wall.
VOICE THREE
Pressing against the wall.
VOICE TWO
The man looks at the ceiling.
VOICE THREE
Blinking hard.
VOICE FOUR
Breathing heavily.
VOICE TWO
Through his nose.
VOICE THREE
His body spasms.
VOICE ONE
Long breaths.
VOICE FOUR
Deep breaths.
VOICE TWO
Uneven breaths.
VOICE ONE
Thanks for letting me smoke. I'll just fucking die if I don't—do you want a fag? Eh—I mean—cigarette.
JOHN
I don't really care for lung cancer.
VOICE ONE
Good for you. It's habit forming. I don't really have all your stuff with me. Your name?
JOHN
John—
VOICE ONE
Yes, that's it. John—John Lee. Eh—my name's Jack Worthing. Doctor—
JOHN
Importance of Being Earnest.
VOICE ONE
What?
JOHN
Oscar Wilde.
VOICE ONE
I don't—
JOHN
Jack Worthing is the name of a character—
VOICE ONE
Oh, that's right. The play about people pretending to be other people just to get laid—something like that.
JOHN
I auditioned for the role a few years ago in school.
VOICE ONE
Really? How nice.
JOHN
Didn't get it.
VOICE ONE
Uh-huh. Why?
JOHN
They said I didn't look the part.
VOICE ONE
Oh, I see. I'm sorry.
JOHN
I'm not. You're American?
VOICE ONE
British.
JOHN
You have an accent.
VOICE ONE
I spent many years in America. Studying. Working.
JOHN
Ah, the crow and the sparrow.
VOICE ONE
What are you talking about?
JOHN
Nothing. A stupid story my father told me when I was young.
VOICE ONE
What story?
JOHN
You and I are the same.
VOICE ONE
I don't understand.
JOHN
You'll never understand.
VOICE ONE
Right. Off to work then, shall we? You probably know what these are. Rorschach blot test cards. Pretty, aren't they?
JOHN
Very pretty.
VOICE ONE
So, tell me what you—
JOHN
See?
VOICE ONE
Well?
JOHN
I don't know.
VOICE ONE
Try. Tell me—
JOHN
Patterns—dots.
VOICE ONE
Yes—yes. But what do you see?
JOHN
I don't see anything.
VOICE ONE
Eh—let me rephrase that—what does this remind you of?
JOHN
Patterns—dots.
VOICE ONE
Well, aside from patterns and dots. The shapes. Do the shapes resemble anything to you? Anything in particular?
JOHN
Nothing.
VOICE ONE
Alright, let's try another. How about this one?
JOHN
Patterns and dots.
VOICE ONE
Look here, you're not making any of this—
JOHN
Easy?
VOICE ONE
Why?
JOHN
Why not?
VOICE ONE
Can we put our eyes on this card and tell us the first thought?—
JOHN
That comes into my pretty head?
VOICE ONE
Don't put words in my mouth.
JOHN
What shall I put in?
VOICE ONE
God, my fucking headache.
JOHN
Listen, Dr. Worthing, I know you are here to—
VOICE ONE
Help you.
JOHN
I appreciate your concern, but I don't need your help. Please go away.
VOICE ONE
Listen, I'm only here to do a job, not to make friends. I'm here to find out why you—
JOHN
Killed him.
VOICE ONE
In so many words.
JOHN
I'm guilty.
VOICE ONE
Let the jury be the judge of this.
JOHN
But I am.
VOICE ONE
Look—
JOHN
I am guilty of each and every shot.
VOICE ONE
Listen, John, I'm tired. I'll be honest with you since I feel we should have an honest working relationship. I'm fucking tired. I've got a fucking headache. I'd rather be in bed—
JOHN
Fucking.
VOICE ONE
Right. And you're in here for murder. It's big time, not some small petty—
JOHN
I know.
VOICE ONE
We're talking about life here. Behind the bars, never to see the light of day, with lots of men—
JOHN
Fucking?
VOICE ONE
Men who'll slice you up for fun. Now, let's start again. So what do we see?
JOHN
I don't know. Dots—patterns.
VOICE THREE
Dr. Worthing, what information did you expect to get out of John Lee through the blot tests?
VOICE ONE
Perhaps an idea of who he is and what he is. Why he did what he did. It's a kind of Tarot cards psychologists use.
VOICE THREE
Was it effective?
VOICE ONE
Not in the beginning. Perhaps he didn't trust me. Perhaps he was just being difficult. Perhaps he still hasn't recovered from the shock—
VOICE THREE
And?
VOICE ONE
Then he gradually opened up and told me things.
VOICE THREE
What kind of things?
VOICE ONE
Things. All kind of things.
VOICE THREE
Like?
VOICE ONE
I thought you're an investigative reporter.
VOICE THREE
I am. So what did John Lee tell you?
VOICE ONE
I can't disclose that special client-counselor information to you, Mr. White. That would be quite unprofessional, don't you think?
VOICE THREE
Then how do you look at this case, Dr. Worthing?
VOICE ONE
What do you mean?
VOICE THREE
You're heterosexual, I presume.
VOICE ONE
Very.
VOICE THREE
You've never cottaged. You're definitely not Oriental. So how do you look at this case as a heterosexual white male?
VOICE ONE
It's a job.
VOICE THREE
No bias?
VOICE ONE
None.
VOICE THREE
Psychologists are, by definition, neutral and impartial to their cases. But you must have some personal opinions.
VOICE ONE
Of course, but—
VOICE THREE
And?
VOICE ONE
Look, this is getting rather—
VOICE THREE
Okay, we'll stop there. Look, just between you and me.
VOICE ONE
This is off the record, right?
VOICE THREE
Oh, definitely. It'd be unethical if we—
VOICE ONE
I think—personally between you and me, I think this whole case is— sick. Public sex is an offence. Murder is an offence. Well, let me put it in simple words—a queer chink who indulges in public sex kills a white man. Where would your fucking sympathies lie? Quite open and shut, isn't it?
VOICE THREE
Quite.
VOICE ONE
But I am keeping an open mind. Have to protect my client's bloody interest.
VOICE THREE
Of course.
VOICE ONE
It's just that I have nothing in common with those types, you know.
VOICE THREE
What types?
VOICE ONE
Those types.
VOICE THREE
I see. It must be very difficult for you as a psychologist to meet such a variety of types every day.
VOICE ONE
It's work.
VOICE THREE
Thank you.
VOICE ONE
Not at all. Anything for you boys at the BBC.
VOICE THREE
Channel Four.
VOICE ONE
Same thing. Say, you don't happen to have a cigarette on you, do you?
VOICE THREE
Sorry, you had the last one. [Pause, loud whisper] Did we get that sound bite?
VOICE FOUR
There were two big trees on a field.
VOICE TWO
One at each end.
VOICE THREE
In one particular tree.
VOICE ONE
Lived a large family of black crows.
VOICE FOUR
The crows were noisy.
VOICE TWO
Loud.
VOICE THREE
Greedy.
VOICE ONE
Clumsy.
VOICE FOUR
Unwieldy.
VOICE TWO
Across the field was another tree.
VOICE THREE
A family of sparrows.
VOICE ONE
Chirpy.
VOICE FOUR
Merrymaking.
VOICE TWO
Graceful.
VOICE THREE
Happy.
VOICE ONE
Beautiful sparrows.
VOICE FOUR
One particular crow always saw them.
VOICE TWO
Always studied and observed them.
VOICE THREE
The lonely crow looked at them.
VOICE ONE
With such longing.
VOICE FOUR
Longing to sing happy, chirpy, little songs with them,
VOICE TWO
Longing to fly in fanciful formations.
VOICE THREE
Climbing up, combing down, bursting free.
VOICE ONE
Soaring heavenwards like a magnificent paper kite.
VOICE FOUR
Swooping earthbound like thunderous ocean waves in a Japanese watercolor picture.
VOICE TWO
The crow made up its mind.
VOICE THREE
Packed its bags.
VOICE ONE
Bade a tearful farewell to its surprised family.
VOICE FOUR
Flew clear across the field.
VOICE TWO
To the tree of singing, happy, chirpy, beautiful sparrows.
VOICE ONE
What are you doing? You're folding something.
JOHN
Very observant.
VOICE ONE
Paper birds.
JOHN
Origami.
VOICE ONE
Pigeons?
JOHN
Do they look like pigeons?
VOICE ONE
Sparrows, then.
JOHN
No.
VOICE ONE
Crows? I don't know.
JOHN
Cranes.
VOICE ONE
They're—interesting. Why are you folding so many of them?
JOHN
For fun.
VOICE ONE
Come on, why are you folding them?
JOHN
It's something you won't understand.
VOICE ONE
I might.
JOHN
You won't.
VOICE ONE
How would you know I won't?
JOHN
Tradition.
VOICE ONE
What tradition?
JOHN
Japanese tradition.
VOICE ONE
But you're Chinese.
JOHN
So?
VOICE ONE
What's the tradition?
JOHN
Dr. Worthing.
VOICE ONE
Jack, please.
JOHN
Dr. Worthing, let's not get too chummy and pretend you're interested in my life because you aren't.
VOICE ONE
I am interested. The Oriental culture has always—
JOHN
Fascinated you?
VOICE ONE
Yes.
JOHN
How nice. What part of our Oriental culture so fascinates you, Dr. Worthing?
VOICE ONE
I like Chinese food.
JOHN
Is it our obedient and subservient geisha girls? Maybe our suntanned go-go girls who'll fuck you for less than five pounds in Bangkok? Or is it our ancient Oriental erotic acts? Maybe The King and I? Miss Saigon? Suzie Wong? Which is it, Dr. Worthing?
VOICE ONE
All those actually, but five pounds a shag sounds reasonable to me,
JOHN
Dr. Worthing, did it ever occur to you that your fascination is rooted in ignorance? Like everyone else—
VOICE ONE
Who's everyone else?
JOHN
Like everyone else, you sit comfortably on the other side of the wall. Perched. Watching us. Studying us. Looking at us. And you never once leave the other side to join us or understand us. You don't want to. We are mythicised by you. We are your interesting geisha girls, bespectacled accountants and dentists, your local Chinese takeaway. Your fascination. And why should you want to climb over and join us? Are you afraid of finding out that we're just the same as you? Have the same feelings and the same fears as you? How we are so much alike? You and I?
VOICE ONE
You must think you're very clever.
JOHN
Enough to detect a stiffening in your voice.
VOICE ONE
It's a very good guess.
JOHN
Nevertheless, a very accurate one, Dr. Worthing.
VOICE ONE
You're full of shit—
JOHN
And you're pathetic—
VOICE ONE
No lousy little queer is going to tell me—
JOHN
My, my. Such unattractive and unprofessional language. Enough to get you dismissed from my case and perhaps from a rosy future in the criminal psychology profession. Who'll have to pay for your excessive cigarettes and lager habits then?
JOHN
I think we've already established the fact that I'm a homo chink, Dr. Worthing. I presume your silence indicates that this session is over. Do drive safely Clear skies can be deceiving.
VOICE THREE
Inspector McLaughlin, what can you tell me about the murder that took place here about a month ago?
VOICE FOUR
There was some commotion in the public convenience by the Beth-nal Green tube station. I was dispatched to the area to investigate the case.
VOICE THREE
What did you see when you got there?
VOICE FOUR
There was a crowd of people milling outside the toilets. Some of them were hysterical. They claimed they heard gunshots inside. The victim and the accused were lying in a pool of blood. Mr. Lee seemed to be holding Mr. Hope in his arms, rocking him like a baby. Mr. Hope had blood all over his head and chest, and Mr. Lee was just holding him.
VOICE THREE
What did you know about this toilet in Bethnal Green?
VOICE FOUR
Nothing much.
VOICE THREE
Let me put it this way
VOICE FOUR
No. Should I?
VOICE THREE
Do you feel John Lee is the killer?
VOICE FOUR
Mr. White, I don't know all the facts surrounding the—
VOICE THREE
You don't need facts. Given what you saw, do you think John Lee is guilty?
VOICE FOUR
I don't know.
VOICE THREE
You are a police inspector. You walk into the public lavatory; you see two men—one dead, and the other living with a gun by his side. What was your first instinct?
VOICE FOUR
From what I saw, the accused was mourning, like he was a friend.
VOICE ONE
So how are you today?
JOHN
In prison. And you?
VOICE ONE
Are they treating you well here?
JOHN
I am tired.
VOICE ONE
How well?
JOHN
It's not exactly Buckingham Palace.
VOICE ONE
You have everything you need, I presume.
JOHN
My own cell. My own shower.
VOICE ONE
Good. Anything else?
JOHN
All the prisoners here look at me very strangely.
VOICE ONE
What do you mean by "strangely"?
JOHN
In the valley of the blind, I'm the one-eyed man.
VOICE ONE
Meaning?
JOHN
They know I'm getting special treatment.
VOICE ONE
How?
JOHN
For a psychologist you ask a lot of stupid questions. Dr. Worthing, you should learn to open your eyes. Because I am different from the rest.
VOICE ONE
You're an alleged murderer.
JOHN
And?
VOICE ONE
And you're gay.
JOHN
Always been the case, hasn't it? Separate from the rest of the world. Even in prison. I'm not sure if I should be grateful in this instance.
VOICE ONE
What else have you been doing?
JOHN
Giving the warden intense blow jobs.
VOICE ONE
What else?
JOHN
Reading,
VOICE ONE
Reading what?
JOHN
A book,
VOICE ONE
What is the book about?
JOHN
The history of Chinese art.
VOICE ONE
Oh.
JOHN
It's either that or cowboy novels with half the pages missing.
VOICE ONE
I can bring you another book the next time.
JOHN
No. Thanks.
VOICE ONE
Good book, is it?
JOHN
Why are you so interested in making small talk?
VOICE ONE
Can't I be friendly?
JOHN
You have ulterior motives.
VOICE ONE
Why are you so defensive?
JOHN
Am I? I thought I was offensive.
VOICE ONE
How far have you gotten? In the book, I mean.
JOHN
You'll find me under Chinese porcelain.
VOICE ONE
First made by the Chinese.
JOHN
Very impressive, Dr. Worthing.
VOICE ONE
I do have that fascination, you know.
JOHN
The fascinating thing about porcelains is the process. Coarse stone powders and clay fused by intense temperatures to create something so delicate,
VOICE ONE
That's a fascinating—eh, interesting—analogy. Let's take this a little further. Who do you see yourself as? Beauty or the Beast?
JOHN
What do you mean?
VOICE ONE
In the context of the whole incident. In Bethnal Green. Do you see yourself as Beauty or the Beast?
JOHN
What do you see me as?
VOICE ONE
Queer.
VOICE THREE
Chink.
VOICE FOUR
Poof.
VOICE TWO
Slit eyes.
VOICE ONE
Queer.
VOICE THREE
Chink.
VOICE FOUR
Cocksucker.
VOICE TWO
Slit eyes.
VOICE ONE
Queer.
VOICE THREE
Chink.
VOICE FOUR
Ugly.
VOICE TWO
Homo.
VOICE ONE
Queer.
VOICE THREE
Chink.
VOICE FOUR
Go away!
VOICE TWO
Chink.
VOICE ONE
Queer!
JOHN
No.
VOICE THREE
Chink!
VOICE FOUR
Go back to China!
VOICE TWO
Slit eyes!
VOICE ONE
Queer!
VOICE THREE
Homo!
JOHN
No.
VOICE FOUR
Go back to Hong Kong!
VOICE TWO
Six shots.
VOICE ONE
Slit eyes!
VOICE THREE
Queer!
VOICE FOUR
A body falls.
VOICE TWO
You don't belong here!
VOICE ONE
Homo!
VOICE THREE
Chink!
VOICE FOUR
Bang!
JOHN
No.
VOICE TWO
Bang!
VOICE ONE
Queer!
JOHN
No.
VOICE THREE
Bang!
VOICE FOUR
Slit eyes!
JOHN
[Louder] No.
VOICE TWO
Bang!
VOICE ONE
Chink!
VOICE THREE
Bang!
JOHN
[Louder] No!
VOICE FOUR
Homo!
VOICE TWO
Bang!
JOHN
[Screams] No!
VOICE ONE
How about this one?
JOHN
Well, it—it does look like a flower.
VOICE ONE
Orchids? Daisies? Daffodils?
JOHN
A poppy. A red poppy.
VOICE ONE
Where did you see this red poppy?
JOHN
I dont remember.
VOICE ONE
What do you feel when you see this card?
JOHN
Sadness. A certain sadness.
VOICE ONE
I see.
JOHN
Yet, warmth.
VOICE ONE
Who do you see in it?
JOHN
Will.
VOICE ONE
William Hope?
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE ONE
What about him?
JOHN
Don't know. Just him and the red poppy.
VOICE ONE
We haven't spoken about William Hope.
JOHN
There's nothing to speak of.
VOICE ONE
Tell me something about him.
JOHN
He's dead.
VOICE ONE
What else?
JOHN
Surely you must have a folder on him.
VOICE ONE
Yes, but I want to hear it from you.
JOHN
I don't want to talk about him.
VOICE ONE
Do you miss him?
JOHN
Why should I?
VOICE ONE
Shouldn't you?
JOHN
I don't miss him.
VOICE ONE
Really? It says in my folder that both of you were involved in some capacity.
JOHN
That's correct.
VOICE ONE
Sexually?
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE ONE
And you?
JOHN
No.
VOICE ONE
I see.
JOHN
Tell me what you see, Dr. Worthing.
VOICE ONE
Only what you want me to see.
JOHN
So we're playing little mind games, aren't we?
VOICE ONE
You are. I'm not.
JOHN
This is all a trick, isn't it? Reverse psychology.
VOICE ONE
Whatever you say
JOHN
Surely a leopard cannot change its spots.
VOICE ONE
As I said before, I have a job to do. I am here to help, if you want me to. If you don't, I'll try and do my job all the same.
JOHN
You're no fun.
VOICE ONE
Murder isn't fun.
JOHN
It can be.
VOICE ONE
Do you regret killing William Hope?
JOHN
No.
VOICE ONE
Why?
JOHN
Because he deserved it.
VOICE ONE
Do you miss him?
JOHN
You're repeating yourself, Dr. Worthing.
VOICE ONE
Well, do you?
JOHN
I don't—that's why I killed him.
VOICE ONE
Why did you do it?
JOHN
Because I hated him.
VOICE ONE
You hate him.
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE ONE
Really hate him.
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE ONE
How much do you hate him?
JOHN
Why are you asking me this question over and over again?
VOICE ONE
Just wanted to make sure. How much do you hate him?
JOHN
I don't know.
VOICE ONE
Hated him so much you murdered him in cold blood?
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE ONE
Hated him so much that you shot him six times?
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE ONE
Not one shot but six.
JOHN
Yes. Six.
VOICE ONE
Six shots. Two in the face. One in the throat. Two in the chest and one in the groin.
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE ONE
Six shots.
JOHN
I'm tired.
VOICE ONE
Six shots.
JOHN
Yes! What do you want from me?
VOICE ONE
Just the truth.
VOICE THREE
You said you had toilet sex before.
VOICE TWO
Yes. With a lot of men. A lot of men.
VOICE THREE
How many men?
VOICE FOUR
Can't say for sure.
VOICE TWO
Lost count after thirty.
VOICE THREE
Tell me about your experiences.
VOICE TWO
Ohhh, wouldn't you like to know, honey?
VOICE ONE
Are you sure no one will recognise me on television?
VOICE THREE
Why did you do it?
VOICE TWO
You know, that's a question I keep asking myself. I don't know. There's a strange kind of attraction to it. Kind of excitement.
VOICE THREE
What kind of excitement?
VOICE TWO
Sexual excitement. A certain kind of anonymity. It's like an exclusive ritual, a gentlemen's sex club.
VOICE ONE
I wouldn't go, but my wife doesn't like to kiss it,
VOICE FOUR
My girlfriend sucks like she's—she just doesn't do it the way I like it.
VOICE TWO
It's convenient. Like a supermarket. It's there. You walk in, get it, and go home. You don't even have to make small talk, buy him a lager, or exchange phone numbers you know they'll never call.
VOICE FOUR
Those queers there like to suck cock—and they do it good. So I'm just obliging them. Could say I'm doing my bit for gay rights, you know what I mean? [Laughs raunchily]
VOICE ONE
I think there's an element of danger to it, too—an element of being discovered. And that's why people like to fuck in parks, back alleys, toilets, offices, and planes. Don't you?
VOICE FOUR
No, I'm not being unfaithful to my girlfriend. I mean, I think being unfaithful to my girlfriend is having sex with another woman.
VOICE ONE
I'm not bisexual, no.
VOICE FOUR
My lover and I have a very open relationship.
VOICE ONE
I don't think there's much cottaging going on anymore, especially when most of the public lavs are shut down and there's always an attendant there. Not anymore. Cottaging went out with disco.
VOICE FOUR
I don't know why there's cottaging. Maybe it has to do with the boarding school system or something.
VOICE TWO
You'll simply have to die when you hear this. I got sucked off by an Anglican priest. Swear to God. See, he preaches in my parish. Didn't recognise me. What a lark! Never thought they'd take the get-down-on-your-knees thing quite so seriously.
VOICE THREE
How old were you when you first had this experience?
VOICE FOUR
About
VOICE TWO
Yeah, once I got fucked in the toilet by this blond Adonis. It was a good fuck. Safe sex, of course. My arse just tingles when I think about it. Oh, can I say that on television?
VOICE ONE
It's really unsafe nowadays to be doing toilets. This thing with AIDS is quite frightening. Who knows what type of people are in there?
VOICE FOUR
I know you can't get it from sucking, but who knows?
VOICE THREE
If there weren't AIDS, would you do the toilets?
VOICE FOUR
If the coppers weren't snooping about, maybe.
VOICE ONE
Yeah, why not?
VOICE TWO
[Airily and in a camp voice] Not anymore. This girl needs a spring mattress, a down pillow, and the West End soundtrack of Camelot before she can do the wild thing. [He snaps his fingers in a dramatic way.]
VOICE ONE
I know what you're feeling.
JOHN
You don't know what I am feeling. Stop trying to say something you don't mean. How can you possibly know what I'm feeling?
VOICE ONE
Because I've lost someone, too. She didn't die, but a loss is a loss.
JOHN
We're not in the same situation.
VOICE ONE
Let's get back to the cards. This reminds you of a red poppy. Somehow you're reminded of William Hope. When did you first meet him?
JOHN
Two—no, three—months ago. January.
VOICE ONE
Where?
JOHN
I don't want to talk about him.
VOICE ONE
Why not?
JOHN
I just don't want to.
VOICE ONE
There must be a reason.
JOHN
I don't have a reason, just a feeling.
VOICE ONE
Of?
JOHN
Pain.
VOICE ONE
You can get rid of this pain by talking about it.
JOHN
I know. But somehow—I like this pain—I need it.
VOICE ONE
Where did you meet William Hope?
JOHN
In a public toilet.
VOICE ONE
Which one?
JOHN
That one.
VOICE ONE
Bethnal Green?
VOICE ONE
And?
JOHN
I was sitting in the cubicle.
VOICE ONE
Cubicle doing what?
JOHN
Waiting.
VOICE ONE
Waiting for what?
JOHN
Waiting.
VOICE ONE
I see.
JOHN
It was late afternoon—cold—
VOICE FOUR
About 4
JOHN
Things were quiet that Thursday—
VOICE FOUR
I don't know why, but I went into the lav at Bethnal Green—Guess I live close by and I've been there before and some chappies got me off.
JOHN
And Will came in—
VOICE FOUR
I went in—thinking, you know, that someone might be there. There's always someone there—if there isn't, you wait. Things do happen, you know. They usually do.
JOHN
At first I thought he was just going to take a piss. Then he started to walk around the toilet. I just kept still in my cubicle—hearing his footsteps.
VOICE FOUR
At first I thought there wasn't anybody there. It was pretty quiet. So I started to check out—
JOHN
He started to walk by the cubicles—really slowly—deliberately. I don't know why but I was anxious—my heart is beating away—I mean, I've done this before but I always get—anxious. And—then he passed mine—my cubicle and—he stopped. He wasn't handsome, but he was—attractive. Dark hair, dark eyes. Something magnetic about his features—almost rough yet—gentle. Though he stood in front of my cubicle for a few seconds, it seemed like an eternity.
VOICE
There was an Oriental bloke—Chinese, Japanese, or something looking at me. He's—not bad looking—looks like any other chink, I guess—
JOHN
He smiled.
VOICE FOUR
He just kept looking—just sitting there—and I wasn't in the mood to play the usual cat-and-mouse games, so I nodded to him.
JOHN
And I nodded. He came into the stall, and we started looking at each other. He shut the door gently behind him—all the while he kept staring at me. It was arresting.
VOICE FOUR
I've never got it off with an Oriental before, you know. They're not my type generally. But there wasn't anyone else around and a mouth is a mouth. And it looks as if he has never done it before. Could be an act for all I know— the innocent puppy dog look. He looked so—what's the word? Fragile? Yeah, fragile. I touched his face.
VOICE FOUR
And rubbed his face around it. I was about to burst in my jeans. My hands cradling his soft black hair. Then he—
JOHN
Unzipped his jeans and took it out. Hard.
VOICE FOUR
It was a warm feeling. Nice.
JOHN
It was—
VOICE FOUR
Good. Good.
JOHN
Yes. Good.
VOICE FOUR
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Slow. Slow.
JOHN
Hmm. Slow.
VOICE FOUR
Hmm. Yeah. Oh God. Oh God.
JOHN
He came over my shirt.
VOICE FOUR
In powerful spurts.
JOHN
Warm and sticky.
VOICE FOUR
A great blow job.
JOHN
It was—beautiful.
VOICE FOUR
I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm not a queer or anything, but, like the other boys, I like to—get off. It's just a physical thing, you know. It's just sex.
VOICE ONE
There, wasn't that simple?
JOHN
I feel so—
VOICE ONE
Vulnerable?
JOHN
I don't like to be—
VOICE ONE
I know. All of us usually don't.
JOHN
I know where I remember seeing the picture of the red poppies. Will has this print that quite looks like that. He hangs it by his bed.
VOICE THREE
Mr. Lee? You're Mr. Lee, aren't you? Excuse me, Mr. Lee?
VOICE TWO
I am no Mr. Lee. Wrong person.
VOICE THREE
But I spoke to—
VOICE TWO
I no Mr. Lee. I no Mr. Lee.
VOICE THREE
Mr. Lee, I'm Allan White from Channel Four; perhaps you've seen me on—
VOICE TWO
Go away.
VOICE THREE
Mr. Lee, we're doing a special documentary about your son's—
VOICE TWO
Please. Please go away.
VOICE THREE
Mr. Lee, have you anything to say about your son's arrest last week?
VOICE TWO
Don't know what you say.
VOICE THREE
Your son who was—
VOICE TWO
No son.
VOICE THREE
There was a fatal shooting in Bethnal Green—
VOICE TWO
No son.
VOICE THREE
Aren't you the father of John Lee?
VOICE TWO
I have no son.
VOICE THREE
But my—
VOICE TWO
No son.
VOICE THREE
Are you—
VOICE TWO
I have no son! I have no son!
VOICE THREE
Mr. Lee?
VOICE TWO
No son! No son! My son is dead.
JOHN
Then what happened?
VOICE ONE
She had to go back to the States,
JOHN
She's probably waiting for your call,
VOICE ONE
You think so?
JOHN
I know. Do you love her?
VOICE ONE
I think so. Back to work.
JOHN
Let's talk some more about—
VOICE ONE
Later. Why cottaging?
JOHN
Why do you go the pubs every night?
VOICE ONE
That's not the same thing.
JOHN
It is.
VOICE ONE
Let's start again. Why cottaging?
JOHN
I don't know.
VOICE ONE
Do you find it exciting—having sex in toilets?
JOHN
No. Yes, but that's not the reason why I—
VOICE ONE
You have difficulty meeting men for sex.
JOHN
No, not really.
VOICE ONE
Difficulty in meeting men?
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE ONE
What about the clubs? Don't you go—
JOHN
Sure, I go. Sometimes. And sometimes I wonder why I even bother.
VOICE ONE
Why?
JOHN
Because everyone there looks intimidating, dressed to the nines. Most of them talk among themselves, have a good time, laughing and drinking with their perfect smiles and perfect hair. And I spend the whole night standing alone in a dark corner. Pretending I'm having a barrel of laughs, pretending I'm having a good time. Pretending I'm enjoying the music. Tapping my feet and nodding my head to the rhythm. And waiting for someone to say something to me. Something nice. Say anything to me. Perhaps it's just that I'm Oriental.
VOICE ONE
Why do you say that?
JOHN
White guys aren't into Orientals.
VOICE ONE
There must be some.
JOHN
Old ones maybe. Looking for a houseboy. Trying to relive the old colonial days. Or they are just fascinated by our culture. Like you. I know I'm not being fair, but that's the way I feel. Sometimes I wish I was— [He laughs]
VOICE ONE
What's so funny?
JOHN
Nothing.
VOICE ONE
Tell me.
JOHN
I wanted to say—sometimes I wish I was—
VOICE ONE
What?
JOHN
White.
VOICE ONE
Why?
JOHN
I don't know. I see pictures of handsome white guys hugging, kissing, holding hands in magazines like they were meant for each other. Always white guys. But always happy. Always together. Even in pornography. I see good-looking white guys fuck each other, make love to each other. I don't know. I see myself in those pictures, those magazines, videos. Suddenly I'm that beautiful white guy everybody wants to make love to. I don't know. Maybe it's just I've always found it difficult to—
VOICE ONE
Blend in?
JOHN
No. To belong.
VOICE ONE
What would you like to say to these people in the gay clubs?
JOHN
Nothing.
VOICE ONE
There must be something. Let's pretend I'm one of these people in the clubs.
JOHN
This is stupid.
VOICE ONE
It's not. Come on.
JOHN
I don't know what to say.
VOICE ONE
Say whatever's on your mind. Tell me how you feel. I am one of those people you see in a club every weekend, I am standing here with my friends.
JOHN
I can't.
VOICE ONE
Try, John. Tell me how and what you've been feeling.
JOHN
I don't know what to say.
VOICE ONE
Try saying hello.
JOHN
Hi.
VOICE ONE
Hi. [Pause] Yes?
JOHN
I want to let you know that I wish you were a little more receptive, more hospitable, welcoming.
VOICE ONE
Carry on.
JOHN
It's not too much to ask, is it? After all, aren't we the same? Can you perhaps smile in my direction? Perhaps speak to me.
VOICE ONE
And?
JOHN
We—we don't have to sleep together. We don't have to—fuck. Maybe we can be friends. Maybe we can dance a little. Maybe see a movie, have dinner together. Maybe laugh a little. Maybe something. I can't anymore; let's stop this.
VOICE ONE
That's good.
JOHN
What's good? I may think all these thoughts, but then I'm back where I started. I find myself standing in that dark corner again. People passing me by. Not smiling. Not saying a word. And I go home alone. It's not so bad going home alone—except sometimes I wish—
VOICE ONE
Yes.
JOHN
To be honest with you, I hate the toilets. I really do—but there's this trembling in me when I'm there—I don't know what it is, but I like it—I enjoy it. And—there's people there who want me. Even for a moment. And the idiot that I am—thinking I really belong—thinking perhaps all these moments will amount to something—someone who will—like me, love me—isn't that the silliest thing you've heard?
VOICE ONE
No.
JOHN
It's sick.
VOICE ONE
No.
JOHN
I just want to be held by these men. For a moment, they do. Hold me. And almost all the time, I treasure that moment. The moment they smile. Then I go back and take a long hot shower. Washing every memory, every touch, and every smell. Only it never quite leaves me. No matter how hard or how long I wash. The dirt, filth penetrates deep into your skin. And for a time I'd try to stay away from the toilet until that familiar loneliness—the need to be held. It's strange. This feeling. This marriage of dirt and desire. The beauty and the beast. It's pathetic. Sometimes I hate myself. [JOHN crushes a paper crane.]
VOICE ONE
The door of the toilet stall.
VOICE FOUR
Open.
VOICE TWO
John is leaning.
VOICE THREE
Against the wall.
VOICE ONE
Looking spent.
VOICE FOUR
Eyes shut.
VOICE TWO
Tight.
VOICE THREE
A young man.
VOICE ONE
Kneeling on the floor.
VOICE FOUR
Gets up.
VOICE TWO
Pulls up his jeans.
VOICE THREE
Zips himself up.
VOICE ONE
Buckles his belt.
VOICE FOUR
The young man.
VOICE TWO
Throws a ball of toilet paper.
VOICE THREE
Into the bowl.
VOICE ONE
Spits twice.
VOICE FOUR
Gently pats John.
VOICE TWO
On the butt.
VOICE THREE
Walks away quickly from the stall.
VOICE ONE
Quickly as if he has something to hide.
VOICE FOUR
John watches him leave.
VOICE TWO
Sits down.
VOICE THREE
Closes the door.
VOICE ONE
He looks up.
VOICE FOUR
At the toilet ceiling.
VOICE TWO
Paint peeling.
VOICE THREE
Interesting shapes.
VOICE ONE
Patterns.
VOICE FOUR
Like the clouds in the sky.
VOICE TWO
Like the blot test cards.
VOICE THREE
It can be anything you want it to be.
VOICE ONE
Depending on how you see it.
VOICE FOUR
And where.
VOICE TWO
In the meanwhile, John sits.
VOICE THREE
Waiting.
VOICE ONE
Waiting.
VOICE FOUR
Waiting.
VOICE TWO
And waiting.
VOICE THREE
Tell me, Officer, in what capacity were you involved with the recent arrest in the toilets at Holland Park?
VOICE TWO
I arrested a suspect who was exposing himself to me.
VOICE THREE
Can you be more specific, please?
VOICE TWO
I was using the public conveniences in Holland Park a few weeks ago.
VOICE THREE
Were you in uniform?
VOICE TWO
No.
VOICE THREE
Why?
VOICE TWO
I was off duty.
VOICE THREE
Really?
VOICE TWO
Yes.
VOICE THREE
Undercover?
VOICE TWO
Uh—no.
VOICE THREE
Go on.
VOICE TWO
A man in his thirties beckoned to me.
VOICE THREE
What do you mean "beckoned"? Did he call you? Whisper to you? Signalled?
VOICE TWO
He nodded to me.
VOICE THREE
You've never seen this man before?
VOICE TWO
No.
VOICE THREE
I see. Please go on.
VOICE TWO
As I said, the gentleman beckoned to me. Saying he had something to show me. He went into the toilet stall and I followed. Then he took off his trousers and started to play with—I arrested him for public indecency.
VOICE THREE
Let me see. He beckoned to you. Nodded, I mean.
VOICE TWO
Yes.
VOICE THREE
He said he had something—
VOICE TWO
Something to show me. Yes.
VOICE THREE
You actually believed that he had something to—
VOICE TWO
Yes. I was curious.
VOICE THREE
I see, curious. And you followed him.
VOICE TWO
Yes.
VOICE THREE
Into the cubicle.
VOICE TWO
Yes.
VOICE THREE
Alone.
VOICE TWO
Yes.
VOICE THREE
And he took off his trousers.
VOICE TWO
Yes.
VOICE THREE
And you were standing there—still watching him.
VOICE TWO
That's right.
VOICE THREE
Then he started to fondle himself—and you were still standing there watching.
VOICE TWO
Yes.
VOICE THREE
And after awhile, you arrested him.
VOICE TWO
Yes.
VOICE THREE
How long was this? Fifteen minutes? Ten minutes? Half an hour?
VOICE TWO
A minute. Thereabouts.
VOICE THREE
That long.
VOICE TWO
I had to be sure—
VOICE THREE
Sure that he was actually fondling his penis?
VOICE TWO
Right.
VOICE THREE
Stroking it?
VOICE TWO
Yes.
VOICE THREE
Sounds like police entrapment.
VOICE TWO
Does it? It wasn't.
VOICE THREE
Thank you. I'll take your word for it.
VOICE ONE
Then what happened?
JOHN
After we did what we did in the toilet, I thought Will was going to leave— you know like the others—without a word—just walk away—but then—he asked me if I wanted to have a drink with him in a nearby pub.
JOHN
Hi.
VOICE FOUR
What's your name?
JOHN
John.
VOICE FOUR
Will. Say, do you fancy a drink?
JOHN
Sure. Yes. [A beat] Of course I went. I mean, there was this guy who I wanted—fancied very much and he's asking me out. He had a lager and 1 had a coke. We talked about what music we liked.
VOICE FOUR
Opera. Puccini.
JOHN
Pet Shop Boys.
VOICE FOUR
Oh.
JOHN
Books,
VOICE FOUR
Bronte.
JOHN
All of them?
VOICE FOUR
Yes.
JOHN
I don't read much, except for schoolbooks.
VOICE FOUR
Hmm.
JOHN
What do you do?
VOICE FOUR
I'm a builder.
JOHN
Really?
VOICE FOUR
Uh-huh.
JOHN
I'm going to Cambridge in a few months. But right now I'm working at my father's restaurant—as a waiter.
VOICE FOUR
Really.
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE FOUR
It's getting late.
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE FOUR
Listen, do you want to come over? To my flat?
JOHN
Sure.
VOICE FOUR
Good.
JOHN
And I spent the night there.
VOICE ONE
How did you feel?
JOHN
High like a kite. Like the whole world was under my feet. Like nothing could go wrong. Nothing. I couldn't believe this was happening. To me, especially. We made love again and again. It was tender and urgent. That night was very special for me. Later in bed we talked a little more about what we liked, what we didn't. Less awkwardly than we did in the pub. He put on some music, hummed to it around the small flat, and made some coffee. Then he talked about football. Suddenly his eyes lit up with a fiery blue intensity. Going on about the F.A. Cup, which teams were his favourite and which teams were bound to make it to the finals. Don't know why. Don't know why all of the sudden I liked football. I never did before.
VOICE ONE
So William was very special to you then?
JOHN
I suppose so.
VOICE ONE
Then why did it happen?
JOHN
It just did.
VOICE TWO
The crow flew across the field.
VOICE THREE
The tree where the sparrows lived.
VOICE ONE
At first the sparrows looked at the crow.
VOICE FOUR
With much suspicion and curiosity.
VOICE TWO
The others with fear, contempt, and hatred.
VOICE THREE
Time went by.
VOICE ONE
The crow couldn't be happier.
VOICE FOUR
It often flew with the sparrows.
VOICE TWO
Braving new heights.
VOICE THREE
A soul lost in love.
VOICE ONE
For the very first time, the crow felt free.
VOICE FOUR
Happy.
VOICE TWO
However, the crow flew haphazardly.
VOICE THREE
Ungracefully.
VOICE ONE
Clumsily.
VOICE FOUR
Often colliding into the other sparrows.
VOICE TWO
The sparrows were far too genteel.
VOICE THREE
Polite.l
VOICE ONE
Embarrassed to say anything.
VOICE FOUR
Refused to confront the crow about its eating habits.
VOICE TWO
Slurping slimy worms in a vulgar fashion.
VOICE THREE
Eating ferociously.
VOICE ONE
Gorging greedily.
VOICE FOUR
Eating much more than the petite appetites the sparrows possessed.
VOICE TWO
Another topic of private discussion.
VOICE THREE
The crow's enthusiastic singing.
VOICE ONE
The sparrows chirped ever so heavenly.
VOICE FOUR
Mellifluously.
VOICE TWO
Superfluously.
VOICE THREE
The crow cawed hysterically.
VOICE ONE
An unbearable pitch.
VOICE FOUR
Out of tune.
VOICE TWO
Out of rhythm.
VOICE THREE
Loudly.
VOICE ONE
The sparrows winced painfully.
VOICE FOUR
Turned a deaf ear.
VOICE TWO
Smiled forcefully.
VOICE THREE
In time the sparrows accepted the crow.
VOICE ONE
Despite the way it ate.
VOICE FOUR
Flew.
VOICE TWO
And sang.
VOICE THREE
A part of their family.
VOICE FOUR
Do you want to hear some music?
JOHN
Sure.
VOICE FOUR
What do you want to hear?
JOHN
Anything. What's that?
VOICE FOUR
Madame Butterfly. It's my favourite.
JOHN
It's nice.
VOICE FOUR
Beautiful.
JOHN
What are they saying?
VOICE FOUR
"I'm happy now, so happy Love me with a little love, a childlike love."
JOHN
Will, did you know it's been two weeks since we first met?
VOICE FOUR
Really?
JOHN
Yes. Can you believe it?
VOICE FOUR
What time is it?
JOHN
About 11
VOICE FOUR
I have to get up early tomorrow.
JOHN
Me, too.
VOICE FOUR
I'm dead tired.
JOHN
I should go soon.
VOICE FOUR
Lie beside me.
JOHN
Hmm, I can hear your heart beating.
VOICE FOUR
You feel nice and smooth.
JOHN
You know something?
VOICE FOUR
What?
JOHN
I'm happy.
VOICE FOUR
Good.
JOHN
Really happy.
VOICE FOUR
Good.
JOHN
Will, we should go out the next time.
VOICE FOUR
The pictures?
JOHN
No.
VOICE FOUR
You mean to the pubs?
JOHN
Yeah, we always seem to stay in; not that I mind, of course.
VOICE FOUR
I'm not comfortable with those types of people.
JOHN
What do you mean?
VOICE FOUR
Well, I don't want to risk being recognised by anyone I know in those places.
JOHN
Sure, okay, I understand. Going to the pubs isn't that important anyway. Besides I like being here. Being with you.
VOICE TWO
Public sex has always been a part of the gay culture. Parks and health club saunas and shower rooms and YMCAs.
VOICE THREE
Isn't it illegal in THE U.K.?
VOICE TWO
Yes
VOICE THREE
Why sex in public places?
VOICE TWO
I'm not sure I'm qualified to answer why gay people are involved in such activities
VOICE THREE
Do you think cttaging is a kind of perversion?
VOICE TWO
No, I don't think it's a perversion. Perhaps a better word is "choice." After all, it's among consenting adults. The cause of cottaging is directly related to the society's discrimination against homosexuals. Instead of providing a healthy and acceptable environment for gay men to come out to the public, they are often forced to meet other gay men in less than conventional surroundings.
VOICE THREE
So you're saying that toilet sex is the fault of the society?
VOICE TWO
No, I'm trying to say that it is the result of public inacceptance and intolerance of gays, which have led them to seek—
VOICE THREE
You have your clubs and pubs.
VOICE TWO
We also have job discrimination, police harassment, gay-bashing, poor AIDS health care—
VOICE THREE
What about AIDS? Don't you think—
VOICE TWO
AIDS should be a paramount concern for all those who have sex in public places.
VOICE THREE
Do you think toilet sex spreads homosexuality?
VOICE TWO
One does not spread homosexuality, and besides, not only are gay men involved but bisexual and straight men like yourself as well.
VOICE THREE
That doesn't answer—
VOICE TWO
If you'd excuse me, I feel that this interview must come to an end. Does the word homophobia mean anything to you?
VOICE ONE
Has Will treated you unkindly at all?
JOHN
No.
VOICE ONE
Not once?
JOHN
No.
VOICE ONE
Every couple must have their ups and downs.
JOHN
We have our differences.
VOICE ONE
What differences?
JOHN
Will can be—excitable.
VOICE ONE
Excitable?
JOHN
Aggressive.
VOICE ONE
Did you mind?
JOHN
I suppose not in the beginning, but later it started to—
VOICE ONE
To what?
JOHN
To hurt.
VOICE ONE
Uh-huh.
JOHN
He cares for me. I know he does. In his own way. There were times after we made love, he'd stroke my head, breathing softly. Soft brown hair. And skin like porcelain. Smooth. White. Pure. But there were times—
VOICE ONE
Yeah, I know.
JOHN
Hope I'm not being too—
VOICE ONE
You're not. Thanks.
JOHN
Sure. By the way, what's her name?
VOICE ONE
Whose name?
JOHN
The woman you were seeing.
VOICE ONE
Eh—Sue—Suzanne.
JOHN
Did you ring her?
VOICE ONE
Yes.
JOHN
And?
VOICE ONE
We're going to work it out.
JOHN
You know, we were happy. Will and I. Really happy together.
VOICE FOUR
Can't see a fucking thing in here.
JOHN
Do you want me to turn on the lights?
VOICE FOUR
No, no.
JOHN
Said you'd be here at 8
VOICE FOUR
Nag, nag, nag. Put on some music.
JOHN
What do you want to hear?
VOICE FOUR
Whatever's on the turntable.
JOHN
Not Madame Butterfly again.
VOICE FOUR
I like it.
JOHN
We always hear it.
VOICE FOUR
I thought you liked it.
JOHN
I did.
VOICE FOUR
Then put on something you like.
JOHN
What's this?
VOICE FOUR
Carmen. [VOICE FOUR hums to the music. Sounds of VOICE FOUR knocking against furniture] Fuck. Where are you?
JOHN
Here.
VOICE FOUR
Where's here?
JOHN
By the bed.
VOICE FOUR
How convenient.
JOHN
I'm not in the mood.
VOICE FOUR
You'll be.
JOHN
Ouch. Stop it. You're hurting me.
VOICE FOUR
You like it.
JOHN
I don't. [Pause] Ouch. Will!
VOICE FOUR
Come here.
JOHN
You are late.
VOICE FOUR
So?
JOHN
You kept me waiting for hours.
VOICE FOUR
It's only a few hours.
JOHN
Where were you?
VOICE FOUR
At the pub.
JOHN
Again?
VOICE FOUR
Why are you so possessive?
JOHN
You kept me waiting.
VOICE FOUR
You had the bloody telly.
JOHN
I came over to see you, not watch telly.
VOICE FOUR
Come here and touch it.
JOHN
Stop it.
VOICE FOUR
You want it. Come on.
JOHN
No.
VOICE FOUR
I'm horny.
JOHN
You're drunk.
VOICE FOUR
I'm not.
JOHN
You smell of lager.
VOICE FOUR
You smell of talcum.
JOHN
I hate it when you're like that.
VOICE FOUR
I'm hard.
JOHN
Get off me now!
VOICE FOUR
You want it.
JOHN
You're hurting me.
VOICE FOUR
You like that.
JOHN
I don't.
VOICE FOUR
Suck it.
JOHN
No.
VOICE FOUR
Suck it.
JOHN
Fuck you.
JOHN
[Whimpering] That hurts.
VOICE FOUR
That'll teach you, you fucking tease.
JOHN
Will, stop it. Stop it.
VOICE FOUR
Suck this.
VOICE FOUR
You like it, don't you? Come on, tell me you like it.
VOICE FOUR
Yeah, yeah. That's good. Lick my balls. Lick it. Now, suck it. Hard. Yeah. [He breathes hard.] Stop. I don't want to come yet. Turn over. I want to fuck you.
JOHN
No.
VOICE FOUR
Shut the fuck up.
JOHN
Will.
VOICE FOUR
You want it. My big cock up your arse.
JOHN
Condom.
VOICE FOUR
Fuck condoms.
JOHN
You promised you'd use—
VOICE FOUR
Shut up.
JOHN
Condoms. [Suddenly JOHN screams in agony.]
VOICE FOUR
Yes. Nice and tight, the way I like it.
JOHN
[Moaning] Will. Take it out. Now.
VOICE FOUR
It feels good.
JOHN
Will. Condom. Please.
VOICE FOUR
Tight.
JOHN
Put it on.
VOICE FOUR
Yes.
JOHN
Will.
VOICE FOUR
You like my tongue in your ear?
JOHN
Don't. [Pause] Mmm.
VOICE FOUR
Feels good.
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE FOUR
Do I feel good?
JOHN
You feel good.
VOICE FOUR
Do you like it?
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE FOUR
You wanted it, didn't you?
JOHN
Yes.
VOICE FOUR
Tell me you want it.
JOHN
I want it. Yes.
VOICE FOUR
Say it again.
JOHN
I want it.
VOICE FOUR
I can't hear you.
JOHN
I want it!
VOICE FOUR
Louder.
JOHN
[Loudly] I want it!
VOICE FOUR
Want what?
JOHN
You! I want you! I want you! I want you! I love you.
VOICE FOUR
I'm coming!
JOHN
You look like shit.
VOICE ONE
Late night.
JOHN
Again?
VOICE ONE
I'm predictable.
JOHN
Why do you do that so often?
VOICE ONE
Do what often?
JOHN
Go out to the pubs and drink.
VOICE ONE
Because I can't think of anything better to do.
JOHN
Really?
VOICE ONE
I need to—
JOHN
Get laid.
VOICE ONE
Let's get back to the session. Tell me what happened that afternoon at Bethnal Green.
JOHN
Nothing.
VOICE ONE
Stop fucking about! I thought we have an honest relationship.
JOHN
We do.
VOICE ONE
Then?
JOHN
I don't want to talk about it,
VOICE ONE
You'll have to. Sooner or later.
JOHN
I don't.
VOICE ONE
Listen, you've got to bloody confront it once and for all.
JOHN
You're only here to finish a report.
VOICE ONE
Yes. But I'm also here to help—
JOHN
I don't want your help, I've told you.
VOICE ONE
You need my help.
JOHN
No, I don't.
VOICE ONE
Well, fuck you! Yes. Fuck you. Fuck all of this,
JOHN
You'll never understand. You can't—
VOICE ONE
How do you know I won't understand if you don't tell me the story? We've been playing this pissy merry-go-round question-and-answer session all week, and I've gotten nowhere. I want to fucking know what happened.
JOHN
No.
VOICE ONE
You're always so fucking high and mighty about how people don't understand where you're coming from. So you're Oriental—a chink. So you're gay, poof, queer. So what? Now's your chance to tell me. To make me understand why you fucking did what you did.
JOHN
You'll never understand.
VOICE ONE
Maybe not. But tell me.
JOHN
No.
VOICE ONE
Come on, John. Try.
JOHN
I don't know where to begin.
VOICE ONE
Where did you get the gun?
JOHN
It belonged to my father. Kept it in the restaurant. Just in case of robbers, he said. Said everyone had one, why shouldn't he? Don't know where he got the gun from. It's illegal, probably, just like Pa to do something like that. I took the gun from him.
VOICE ONE
Why?
JOHN
Maybe I just wanted to. Take the gun.
VOICE ONE
To shoot someone?
JOHN
Maybe.
VOICE ONE
Willliam Hope?
JOHN
Maybe.
VOICE ONE
Why?
JOHN
Because.
VOICE ONE
Because?
JOHN
Because. [Pause] He didn't speak to me for several days—days turned into weeks—I don't know—I tried ringing him—leaving messages—on his answering machine, but he didn't ring back. So that Saturday afternoon, I decided to go over to his flat. I wanted to see him. Just to talk or something. But when I arrived at his place, I didn't ring the doorbell. I didn't even use the key he gave me. All I did was to stand outside a bus stop across the street. Looking at his flat with the gun in my jacket. Then two—three hours later, he stepped outside. Probably taking a walk. I followed him, and all the time I was following him, I had an uncomfortable but certain feeling I knew where he was going.
VOICE THREE
To the lav in Bethnal Green.
JOHN
I said, maybe not.
VOICE TWO
Maybe he's going to the tube station.
JOHN
Shopping.
VOICE THREE
Maybe a walk in the park.
JOHN
Maybe.
VOICE TWO
Maybe some groceries at Sainsbury's.
JOHN
Maybe a drink at the pub.
VOICE THREE
Maybe he's meeting some friends.
JOHN
What friends?
VOICE TWO
And?
JOHN
And he walked into the lav.
VOICE THREE
I was crushed.
VOICE TWO
Destroyed.
VOICE THREE
But I knew it.
JOHN
Maybe that's why I followed him.
VOICE TWO
To confirm my suspicions.
VOICE THREE
Maybe that's why I took the gun.
JOHN
Maybe.
VOICE TWO
The cheating bastard.
JOHN
I stopped outside. Didn't want to go in. Didn't dare.
VOICE THREE
Dare what?
JOHN
Dare to confront him.
VOICE TWO
Dare to hear the truth?
VOICE THREE
See the truth?
VOICE TWO
Dare to use the gun?
JOHN
I don't know.
VOICE THREE
Maybe he's really taking a piss.
VOICE TWO
Maybe.
VOICE THREE
Yeah. Right.
JOHN
I don't know. Then I saw people, men, going into the lav. But no one came out. For the longest time. I kept fingering my gun.
VOICE TWO
That son of a bitch.
VOICE THREE
You are an idiot.
VOICE TWO
I knew it.
VOICE THREE
All the time.
VOICE TWO
Why? Why are you doing this?
VOICE THREE
Kill him.
JOHN
Feeling the cold steel in my pocket. I started making mental notes of who went in and who went out.
VOICE TWO
Young black guy with an Adidas sportsbag.
VOICE FOUR
White guy in his thirties carrying The Independent.
VOICE THREE
Old man in a brown blazer.
VOICE FOUR
White boy with a baseball cap.
VOICE TWO
Still he didn't come out.
JOHN
Then when I thought no one was in there anymore, I walked into the lav.
VOICE THREE
The gun.
VOICE TWO
The loo was empty.
VOICE THREE
Deathly quiet.
VOICE TWO
Deathly still.
VOICE THREE
The gun pressed against his jacket.
VOICE TWO
Pressed against his beating heart.
JOHN
Then I saw Will in the cubicle. Pretending to take a piss.
VOICE THREE
He was pulling his cock.
VOICE TWO
Deliberately.
JOHN
He seemed surprised to see me.
VOICE THREE
Almost frightened.
VOICE TWO
Shocked.
JOHN
Hi.
VOICE FOUR
Hi. Fancy bumping into you, here of all places.
JOHN
Yes. Fancy that.
VOICE THREE
Awkward silence.
VOICE TWO
The gun.
VOICE THREE
Outside traffic noises.
VOICE FOUR
Eh—everyone's gone.
JOHN
Really.
VOICE FOUR
So how have you been?
JOHN
Good.
VOICE FOUR
You alright? You look kinda—
JOHN
You didn't call.
VOICE FOUR
I was busy. Work, you know.
JOHN
I rang. Left messages.
VOICE FOUR
I know.
JOHN
You could have called.
VOICE FOUR
I know, but I was busy—
JOHN
I must have left you a thousand messages.
VOICE FOUR
Yeah.
JOHN
I didn't hear from you at all.
VOICE FOUR
Listen, do you want to go outside so we can talk?
JOHN
No. Let's talk here. It's quieter.
VOICE FOUR
Outside.
JOHN
Here. I want to talk—
VOICE FOUR
Alright, here. [Pause] Well?
JOHN
You look—
VOICE TWO
John reached out to touch his face.
VOICE FOUR
I'm okay. Really.
VOICE THREE
Brushing me away.
VOICE TWO
The gun.
VOICE FOUR
Yes.
JOHN
Why?
VOICE FOUR
I don't know why. I just don't want it.
JOHN
Then why are you here? [Pause] I'm sorry.
VOICE FOUR
That's not the point.
JOHN
Forget it.
VOICE FOUR
Let me get to the point
JOHN
He said it very evenly—calm.
VOICE FOUR
We are history. Okay? I'm not what you think I am. I'm not that way. I enjoyed doing what we do. But I'm not—queer.
JOHN
Like me.
VOICE FOUR
Told you from the start that I date women and I like to fool around with guys—you know, just to get off—but I'm not like that—like you. And I don't want to play games, the idea of hiding every time—hide and seek. People may start getting strange ideas about me and you—might start thinking we're queer—that I'm queer—something I'm not. Don't misunderstand, whatever we had—was great. I enjoyed it—had a great time—I know you did, too—I don't know, but maybe I just didn't like the idea of turning—perhaps we could be friends.
JOHN
But I wasn't listening. Not a word. All I heard was—
VOICE FOUR
It's over.
VOICE TWO
It's over.
VOICE THREE
It's over.
JOHN
Like some strange, hypnotic melody dancing in my mind.
VOICE TWO
Intoxicating me.
VOICE THREE
Suffocating me.
JOHN
Somehow I anticipated this. I knew this was going to happen.
VOICE TWO
Him leaving.
JOHN
Him saying just that.
VOICE THREE
But he doesn't know better.
JOHN
Maybe that's why I took the gun.
VOICE TWO
Maybe.
JOHN
Maybe I was expecting he'd say this.
VOICE THREE
Maybe.
JOHN
He belonged to me. Only to me.
VOICE TWO
And you took the gun.
JOHN
To make him stay.
VOICE THREE
Force him to stay.
JOHN
No matter what. I was pleading—pleading with him.
VOICE TWO
Begging.
JOHN
Raising my voice. Anything to make him stay.
VOICE THREE
Please don't—
JOHN
Don't say—
VOICE TWO
Please, I'm sorry—
JOHN
I won't anymore.
VOICE FOUR
Listen, this has nothing to—
JOHN
Will, please, you can't—
VOICE FOUR
I'm not queer, Johnny! I'm not one of your kind. I—I've got nothing against—you—your kind—at all. This whole thing was all in your head. Shouldn't have allowed it to happen the way it did—it went too far.
JOHN
I felt so helpless.
VOICE TWO
Desperate.
VOICE FOUR
It's over.
VOICE THREE
Angry.
VOICE TWO
Hurt.
VOICE FOUR
It's over.
VOICE THREE
Pained.
VOICE TWO
The gun.
VOICE THREE
In your jacket.
VOICE TWO
Waiting.
VOICE FOUR
Hey, Johnny, I'm sorry. Really am,
VOICE ONE
Final scene in Bizet's Carmen.
VOICE TWO
No.
JOHN
Don't go.
VOICE THREE
Not yet.
VOICE TWO
Please.
VOICE ONE
The Death Scene.
JOHN
Will smiled that smile, that familiar smile I always see in my mind whenever he's away from me.
VOICE THREE
He shrugged his shoulders.
VOICE ONE
Don José arrives at the bullring.
VOICE TWO
Will put his hands in his pockets.
VOICE THREE
And started to walk out of the toilet.
VOICE ONE
Don José begs for Carmen's love.
JOHN
I wanted to shout, but no sound came out. No words.
VOICE TWO
You have a gun.
VOICE ONE
Carmen declares it's over between them.
VOICE THREE
You can make him stay.
VOICE TWO
Force him to stay.
VOICE ONE
Don José implores Carmen to return to him.
VOICE THREE
Then maybe he'll change his mind.
VOICE TWO
He'll see things your way.
VOICE ONE
A triumphant shout from the bullring!
VOICE THREE
Understand what you're trying to say.
VOICE TWO
What you feel.
VOICE ONE
The matador has plunged his sword into the bull,
VOICE THREE
Stay.
VOICE ONE
Plunge!
VOICE TWO
Stay.
VOICE ONE
Plunge!
VOICE THREE
Please stay.
VOICE ONE
Plunge!
VOICE TWO
Your gun.
VOICE ONE
Carmen admits the matador is her new lover.
JOHN
Then I remembered the gun.
VOICE THREE
Take it. out.
VOICE TWO
Now!
VOICE ONE
The matador stabs the bull with his glistening blade.
JOHN
Took it out of my jacket.
VOICE ONE
Stab!
VOICE THREE
Aim.
VOICE ONE
Stab!
VOICE TWO
Shoot!
VOICE ONE
Stab!
VOICE THREE
He's walking away.
VOICE ONE
Don José realizes Carmen doesn't love him anymore.
VOICE THREE
He used you.
VOICE TWO
Like everyone else.
JOHN
I—I pointed it at his back.
VOICE THREE
I won't be used again.
VOICE TWO
Stay.
VOICE THREE
I want you.
VOICE TWO
Don't go.
VOICE ONE
Rage and despair overwhelm Don José.
VOICE THREE
Fuck you.
VOICE TWO
You're like the fucking rest.
VOICE THREE
A quick feel.
VOICE TWO
A willing mouth.
VOICE THREE
And a willing arse.
VOICE ONE
Don José pulls out his knife.
VOICE TWO
Love me.
VOICE THREE
Please stay.
JOHN
Stay!
VOICE ONE
The lusty knife glistening in the afternoon light.
VOICE FOUR
What the fuck?
VOICE TWO
Gun pointing to Will.
VOICE FOUR
You're bloody crazy.
VOICE ONE
The crowd cheers, "Viva, viva."
VOICE TWO
Queer!
VOICES ONE
Viva! Viva!
VOICE THREE
Chink!
VOICES ONE
Viva! Viva!
VOICE TWO
Pouf!
VOICES ONE
Viva! Viva!
VOICE THREE
Homo!
VOICES ONE
Kill it!
JOHN
It is loaded.
VOICE THREE
Will looked at him.
VOICE TWO
Disbelief.
VOICE THREE
Snarled.
VOICE TWO
As if daring him to shoot.
VOICE ONE
Carmen laughs.
VOICE TWO
Will continued to go.
VOICE THREE
Stay.
VOICE TWO
What else can I do?
VOICE THREE
You're not walking out.
VOICE ONE
Don José raises the knife to his blood-red eyes.
JOHN
Will?
VOICE TWO
The gun trembled,
VOICE ONE
The matador thrusts his sword into the bull.
VOICE THREE
Don't go.
VOICE TWO
The gun swayed.
VOICE THREE
You're not going anywhere.
VOICE ONE
The bull collapses.
VOICE TWO
Under his sweaty fingers.
VOICE THREE
Stay!
VOICE ONE
The bullring is swimming in the sea of blood.
VOICE TWO
Wrapping around the trigger.
VOICE THREE
Stay!
VOICE ONE
The crowd is cheering and tossing roses.
VOICE TWO
Cock the pistol.
JOHN
Then I started to squeeze the trigger.
VOICE TWO
Bullet in the chamber.
VOICE ONE
Ready to fire.
JOHN
Will?
VOICE TWO
He continues walking
VOICE ONE
Don José plunges the knife into Carmen.
JOHN
I love you.
VOICE THREE
Bang!
VOICE TOW
His body crumpled
VOICE THREE
Like a paper crane against a flame.
VOICE TWO
And he fell against the white urinals.
VOICE THREE
His right hand clutching a side of urnial.
VOICE TWO
Holding tight
VOICE THREE
He was in shock.
VOICE TWO
You're not going.
JOHN
My hands shaking.
VOICE TWO
Bang!
VOICE THREE
Another shot.
VOICE TWO
You're staying.
VOICE THREE
You need me!
VOICE TWO
You love me.
VOICE THREE
We'll be together.
VOICE ONE
Don José lifts the blood-stained knife.
VOICE TWO
We'll be happy.
VOICE THREE
Bang!
VOICE ONE
The knife plunges again!
JOHN
My eyes were closed tight. When I opened them, I found him on the floor.
VOICE TWO
Spread-eagled.
VOICE THREE
He was still moving.
VOICE TWO
Tough son of a bitch.
VOICE THREE
Gagging sounds.
VOICE TWO
Struggling towards the door of the toilet,
VOICE ONE
He was determined to walk out.
JOHN
Determined to leave me.
VOICE TWO
Motherfucker.
VOICE THREE
You cannot leave.
VOICE TWO
You'll stay.
VOICE TWO
Bang!
VOICE THREE
Bang!
VOICE TWO
Bang!
VOICE THREE
Six shots.
VOICE TWO
Then he was still.
VOICE ONE
No more cheering.
VOICE THREE
His body lay limp on the cold mosaic floor.
VOICE TWO
I've never seen so much red in my life.
VOICE THREE
Except when I was a child.
VOICE TWO
In Hong Kong.
VOICE THREE
Chinese New Year.
VOICE TWO
Red firecrackers littered the narrow streets.
VOICE THREE
Like withered leaves in autumn.
VOICE TWO
The whole toilet was red.
VOICE THREE
The white porcelain turned red.
JOHN
Suddenly I felt drained of all energy, and I dropped the gun. I limped slowly towards his lifeless body and started to hold him. Tight, Called him. Will? Will? But he didn't respond. Didn't move. Hot tears suddenly filled my eyes. I started to rock him slowly like a baby, my baby, and then I kissed him. On his still-bloody lips. Oh God, what have I done? What have I—I wanted to scream. Wanted to die. I kept staring at the toilet. The pretty mosaic tiles—with patterns—flower patterns. Pretty flower patterns. They looked like they were dancing. Flower patterns covered with blood—all over the tiles—and the walls. And the urinals were all red. Red. Oh my God, Í shot him. I shot him. I shot him. [An awkward silence. Suddenly JOHN screams at the top of his voice. It's an animal cry, a cry of aguish and pain that he has been harbouring all this time. He screams repeatedly.]
VOICE TWO
The crow was happy.
VOICE FOUR
Content.
VOICE ONE
A part of this feathered family.
VOICE THREE
It sang merrily.
VOICE TWO
Ate and flew.
VOICE POUR
Slept.
VOICE ONE
Played with the sparrows.
VOICE THREE
The days passed.
VOICE TWO
The crow felt homesick.
VOICE FOUR
It dawned upon the crow.
VOICE ONE
It will never truly belong with them.
VOICE THREE
The beautiful, chirpy, graceful, little sparrows.
VOICE TWO
The black crow may sing, eat, or fly with them.
VOICE FOUR
It will never feel like one of them.
VOICE ONE
Never be one of them.
VOICE THREE
A sparrow.
VOICE TWO
The crow was disheartened.
VOICE FOUR
Once again.
VOICE ONE
The crow bade its farewells.
VOICE THREE
Flew across the green field.
VOICE TWO
Back to the tree.
VOICE FOUR
Back to its family of crows.
VOICE ONE
Where it belonged.
VOICE THREE
Where it truly belonged.
VOICE TWO
Or so the crow thought.
VOICE FOUR
The other crows welcomed it back.
VOICE ONE
They flew and ate with their old friend.
VOICE THREE
Something wasn't quite the same.
VOICE TWO
The crow flew in fanciful circles.
VOICE FOUR
In the air, soaring up and down.
VOICE ONE
The crow ate little.
VOICE THREE
A genteel fashion.
VOICE TWO
The crow burst into song.
VOICE FOUR
Songs it had once sung in the company of sparrows.
VOICE ONE
The other crows found the crow distant.
VOICE THREE
Different,
VOICE TWO
Strange.
VOICE FOUR
Peculiar.
VOICE ONE
Queer.
VOICE THREE
They began avoiding the crow.
VOICE TWO
The crow was never more alone.
VOICE FOUR
It didn't belong to the sparrows or the crows.
VOICE ONE
Again the black crow packed its belongings.
VOICE THREE
It flew away.
VOICE TWO
From the tree of crows.
VOICE FOUR
From the tree of sparrows.
VOICE ONE
In search of another tree.
VOICE THREE
Another field.
VOICE TWO
Another family.
VOICE FOUR
Another life.
VOICE ONE
How are you doing today?
JOHN
Fine.
VOICE ONE
That's good.
JOHN
You're through with the analysis, aren't you?
VOICE ONE
Yes. I'm going to submit my findings this—
JOHN
And you'll be too busy to come by.
VOICE ONE
Well, there isn't really a need for me to—
JOHN
I see.
VOICE ONE
But—I will. Once I finish the report.
JOHN
We can talk—
VOICE ONE
Sure.
JOHN
I'd like that very much.
VOICE ONE
Yeah.
JOHN
Good.
VOICE ONE
I'll come by. [Pause] Has anyone come by to see you at all?
JOHN
No one.
VOICE ONE
Your parents?
JOHN
They're too embarrassed to come.
VOICE ONE
Sorry.
JOHN
I'm not. Are there any questions you have that I haven't answered?
VOICE ONE
No, not really.
JOHN
You know, he means the world to me.
VOICE ONE
I know.
JOHN
I think you should put that down in your report.
VOICE ONE
I will.
JOHN
I had so many plans for the both of us.
VOICE ONE
Uh-huh.
JOHN
Dreams. Things we'd do together. I read in the papers that there'll be a performance of Carmen next week in London. Will, he'll like that. Imagine, with all his opera records, he's never once been to a performance. He'll like that. He'll like Carmen.
VOICE ONE
But he's gone.
JOHN
Who's gone?
VOICE ONE
William Hope.
JOHN
Oh no he's not.
VOICE ONE
What do you mean?
JOHN
He'll never be gone. Now I have him where I want him.
VOICE ONE
I don't understand.
JOHN
I've finally got Will all to myself now.
VOICE THREE
So, Suzanne, the woman you said you were romantically involved with, doesn't exist?
VOICE ONE
No, I invented her.
VOICE THREE
Why?
VOICE ONE
To gain someone's trust, you have to blemish the truth.
VOICE THREE
You told John Lee a personal story, and he told you his.
VOICE ONE
Old trade secret.
VOICE THREE
You lied to him.
VOICE ONE
I got what I wanted.
VOICE THREE
Isn't that unethical?
VOICE ONE
Isn't this whole interview?
VOICE THREE
So you found John Lee sane during the time of the murder?
VOICE ONE
Yes, I found him sane.
VOICE THREE
Why?
VOICE ONE
He was sane, like most of us. It was more a crime of passion. He did truly love William Hope, but the relationship was not reciprocal.
VOICE THREE
Taking someone's life is a sane act?
VOICE ONE
No, but the circumstances surrounding the death were. You see, not all of us have the intense passion that John possessed—a passion enough to kill the person he loved.
VOICE THREE
Aren't you making this case a little more romantic than you should?
VOICE ONE
Perhaps. But I think you'd probably find the same answers I did by going through the case.
VOICE THREE
This is certainly quite a change from what you told me before.
VOICE ONE
Yes, I know.
VOICE THREE
What was the verdict?
VOICE ONE
Life without parole.
VOICE THREE
Thank you, Dr. Worthing. We'll leave it there. Have you been back to see John Lee since the trial?
VOICE ONE
Eh—no. But I will. I did promise him I would—when my work's a little lighter. Listen, I've got to go.
VOICE THREE
One last question, Dr. Worthing. You never told me why he folded those paper cranes.
VOICE ONE
A Japanese tradition that if you folded the paper cranes—a thousand of them—your wish would come true.
VOICE THREE
And what wish did John Lee have? For folding the thousand paper cranes?
VOICE ONE
You mean you can't guess?
VOICE FOUR
Bang.
VOICE TWO
Bang.
VOICE ONE
Bang.
VOICE THREE
Bang.
VOICE TWO
Bang.
VOICE FOUR
Bang.
VOICE TWO
Six shots,
VOICE THREE
A body falls.
VOICE FOUR
Hot blood splatters.
VOICE TWO
On the peeling walls.
VOICE THREE
On the cold hard floors.
VOICE ONE
Red flower.
VOICE TWO
Patterns.
VOICE THREE
On white.
VOICE FOUR
Mosaic tiles.
VOICE TWO
On cool.
VOICE THREE
White porcelain.
VOICE ONE
Smells of.
VOICE FOUR
Gun smoke.
VOICE THREE
Antiseptic.
VOICE TWO
Urine.
VOICE THREE
Semen.
VOICE ONE
A boy.
VOICE FOUR
Holding a man.
VOICE THREE
Two of them.
VOICE FOUR
Alone.
VOICE TWO
In a public toilet.
VOICE ONE
At Bethnal Green.
VOICE TWO
Outside the tube station.
VOICE FOUR
Beside a small park.
VOICE THREE
With flowers.
VOICE ONE
And some trees.
VOICE FOUR
And in one particular tree.
VOICE TWO
A lone black crow.
VOICE ONE
Sits comfortably.
VOICE THREE
On a branch.
VOICE FOUR
Cawing.
VOICE THREE
Cawing.
VOICE ONE
Watching painfully.
VOICE TWO
Watching longingly.
VOICE ONE
The sparrows.
VOICE FOUR
In a nearby tree.
VOICE THREE
Singing.
VOICE FOUR
Sweetly.
VOICE TWO
Without a care in the world.
VOICE THREE
Bang!
VOICE ONE
Bang!
VOICE TWO
Bang!
VOICE FOUR
Bang!
VOICE ONE
Bang!
VOICE THREE
Bang!
VOICE TWO
Six shots.
JOHN
Two bodies fall.
VOICE THREE
Tara, love. See you at 4
VOICE FOUR
Sorry, I can't come to the phone. Leave a message and I'll ring back. Bye—
VOICE TWO
Say, would you like to come in for a show? We've got topless girls—
VOICE THREE
Fucking terrorists. They've got the bleeding tubes all shut off because of a bomb scare. Now, how the fuck can I get to Camden?
VOICE FOUR
Do you want tickets to Phantom? I've got good seats for—sorry, no speak Japanese. Phantom. Only one hundred quid for a ticket. Very little yen. Yes?—
VOICE ONE
More crisis at Buckingham Palace. Now next on the turntable is another member of the British royal family, Boy George—
VOICE THREE
[Sound of cars honking]
VOICE TWO
[Sound of an underground train leaving the platform]
VOICE FOUR
[Sound of Big Ben striking 4
FAIROUZ
He sent me a horn in a box. It was a ram's horn.
GRAVER
He is a funny guy.
FAIROUZ
Do you laugh at him?
CRAVER
[Gets to his feet] What did you say your name was?
FAIROUZ
I don't laugh at him.
CRAVER
What's your background? He's never clear where he's from.
FAIROUZ
Can you tell me how he's doing?
CRAVER
I told you over the phone I haven't heard from him in months.
FAIROUZ
You are his best friend.
CRAVER
I'm sorry to hear that.
FAIROUZ
Where is he? [Beat] Mr. Craver.
CRAVER
Perry. Mr. Perry. Craver's my first name. C.R.A.V.E.R. How did you get my address?
FAIROUZ
Remzi wrote in a letter....
CRAVER
I hardly know him.
FAIROUZ
He wrote
CRAVER
People get lost. Call the Army.
FAIROUZ
I did.
CRAVER
[Does another headstand] This kid over in Saudi taught me how to do this. It's not keeping your legs in the air; it's how you breathe. See? You got to push the air up through your lungs and into your feet. Then your feet will stay up, float like balloons.
FAIROUZ
Can Remzi do that? Walk on his hands like you?
CRAVER
[Stands] Remzi had no balance.
FAIROUZ
He wrote me that he loved you.
CRAVER
And who do you love?
FAIROUZ
I threw it out. The ram's horn.
CRAVER
We must have bought a dozen horns while we were over there, but not one of them was good enough to send her. He wrote her name on the inside of it. F.A.I.R.O.U.Z. Fairouz. That was the name he wrote.
FAIROUZ
It had a bad smell.
CRAVER
Fairouz isn't anything like you.
FAIROUZ
Horns make noise.
CRAVER
He said she was like a flower.
FAIROUZ
I don't like noise. Remzi knows that.
CRAVER
No, he said she was like milk, sweet, fresh milk.
FAIROUZ
He likes to race. Did he race with you? He's not fast, but he won't believe it.
CRAVER
Fairouz would have appreciated his gift.
FAIROUZ
Do you expect me to beg you?
CRAVER
Know what we call Arabs over there?
FAIROUZ
I'm not afraid of you, Mr. Perry. When I find out, I'll be back. [She exits.]
CRAVER
[Calls after her] Fairouz! [Beat] He was my friend.
CRAVER
Are you looking for him, too?
LUE MING
I might be. Who?
CRAVER
Remzi. Remzi Saboura.
LUE MING
Are you Mr. Calley?
CRAVER
No. I'm not.
LUE MING
Oh my. I'm in the wrong house.
CRAVER
How did you get in?
LUE MING
I was honing in on a small jewelry store in Columbus, Georgia. Is this Georgia?
CRAVER
Kentucky. Motel 6.
LUE MING
And you're not Calley?
CRAVER
Are you Chinese?
LUE MING
Oh no. I was born in Hanoi.
CRAVER
What are you doing here?
LUE MING
I've never left my country. I'm a real homebody.
CRAVER
You speak good English.
LUE MING
Haven't tried it before, but it's going nicely, isn't it?
CRAVER
What do you want?
LUE MING
He's about five foot ten, red in the face, and likes colorful fish. He should be in his fifties by now.
CRAVER
I'm not Calley. I can't help you.
LUE MING
Who are you?
CRAVER
Craver Perry.
LUE MING
What do you do?
CRAVER
Not much right now. I'm ... on leave.
LUE MING
Ah. An army fellow. Where were you stationed in Vietnam?
CRAVER
Vietnam? I wasn't in Vietnam. I was in the Gulf. In Saudi. In Iraq.
LUE MING
How can they fight in Vietnam and the Gulf at the same time?
CRAVER
We're not fighting in Vietnam.
LUE MING
Of course you are. Why just yesterday my grandfather was out in the fields trying to pull a calf out of the mud. The rains. So much rain. You flew over with your plane and bang, bang, bang, one dead cow and one dead grandfather.
CRAVER
I've never even been to Vietnam.
LUE MING
Of course you have.
CRAVER
The Vietnam War ended over fifteen years ago, lady.
LUE MING
Are you sure?
CRAVER
Positive.
LUE MING
Who won? My God, who won?
CRAVER
You did.
LUE MING
Oh, I wish I could have told Grandpa that this morning. [Beat] So I missed the house and the year. But not the profession. How many gooks have you killed?
CRAVER
I don't kill gooks; I kill Arabs.
LUE MING
Really? Arabs?
CRAVER
Not just any Arabs, Iraqi Arabs. Saddam Arabs. But that war is over now, too.
LUE MING
Who won?
CRAVER
We had a kill ratio of a thousand to one.
LUE MING
Oh my! [Beat] What's it like to kill a woman?
CRAVER
I never killed anyone.
LUE MING
Such modesty! In my village alone you killed sixteen people, seven pigs, three cows, and a chicken.
CRAVER
I never killed anyone in my life. I never got that close.
LUE MING
Does it feel the same to shoot a cow in the back as it does to shoot a man in the back?
CRAVER
Get the fuck out of my room.
LUE MING
I can't leave now! I think we're falling in love. [Caresses his face]
REMZI
I get more traction running on this sand.
CRAVER
Get on your mark.
REMZI
Like a streak of light IMI pass you by, Craver. Just watch.
CRAVER
Get set!
REMZI
You just watch me.
CRAVER
Go!
REMZI
Wait! Wait! Cramp. Shit.
CRAVER
Bad luck to get beat before we start.
REMZI
I'm going to visit the village where my parents were born. When I get my first leave. Want to come with me?
CRAVER
Nope.
REMZI
Don't like to be seen with Arabs. Look. I've got more money than you. You're broke and I'm Arab. That about evens it out, doesn't it?
CRAVER
The CBU-75 carries eighteen hundred bomblets, called Sad Eyes. Sad Eyes.
REMZI
What do you think it's like ...
CRAVER
One type of Sad Eyes can explode before hitting the ground,
REMZI
. . . to kill someone?
CRAVER
Each bomblet contains six hundred razor-sharp steel fragments.
REMZI
I wonder what I'll feel like after I do it?
CRAVER
It's nothing personal. We're not just here to get them out of Kuwait but to protect a way of life.
CRAVER
Those poor bastards are so brainwashed by Saddam, they need to kill like we need oxygen.
REMZI
When I went in for the interview, the recruiter asked me was I against taking another person's life.
CRAVER
If you are, you could fuck up an entire war,
REMZI
I just went in for the interview to piss my mother and sister off. The recruiter said, "What you need, son, is all right here." He looked at me and I
CRAVER
"A quiet sense of pride." [Beat] I'm not going to die.
REMZI
I am.
CRAVER
It's hot here. Why does it have to be so hot here? Can't we just turn the sun up a few degrees and roast those motherfuckers! All these weeks with our ass frying in the sun, crawling through the sand like mutts, and the drills, drills, drills. Tomorrow might be the real thing. [Beat] We've got eight types of guided bombs.
REMZI
I wonder if you'll see it.
CRAVER
There's the CM-130, an electro-optically or infrared two-thousand-pound powered bomb. See what?
REMZI
How I die.
CRAVER
Then there's the GBU-10 Paveway II, a two-thousand-pound laser-guided bomb based on an Mk 84.
REMZI
Let's say I'm lying over there, dead as can be, and then you see it's me, from a distance. But you still have to walk over to my body to check it out. So, how would you walk?
CRAVER
We've got Harm missiles, Walleyes, Clusters, and guided antitanks.
REMZI
Craver. This is something important I'm talking about. Let's say I'm you and I see me lying up ahead, dead. I stop in my tracks. I'm upset. We were friends and I've got to cross the thirty or so feet between us. [Does a "walk" over to the imaginary dead body] No. That feels too confident.
CRAVER
And you wouldn't feel confident because .. .
REMZI
Because I'd be thinking
CRAVER
Right. So maybe you'd do it like this. Kind of .. . [Does "his walk" up to the imaginary "body"]
REMZI
That's too careful.
CRAVER
Yeah. And too scared. I mean I might be feeling in a pretty nice way, thinking about being alive and not quite as dead as you.
REMZI
You've got a point there. You might be feeling pretty okay.
CRAVER
And fucking lucky too cause the blood's still rolling through my veins.
REMZI
Something like this maybe. [Does another "walk," a sort of combination of his others]
CRAVER
Yes! That's it! That's it! Let me try. Okay. I see you up ahead of me, twenty feet, maybe thirty, and I want to get closer to you.... Why do I want to get closer if you're dead and I know it's you? I mean there's nothing else to figure out then, is there?
REMZI
Because ... I'm your friend and you'd rather be the one to report my death than some jerk who doesn't know I exist.
CRAVER
Right. So here I go.
REMZI
Get on your mark.
CRAVER
Get set.
REMZI
Go!
CRAVER
[Copies REMZI's walk, but not quite as well] That didn't feel right.
REMZI
Your shoulders are too tight. Loosen up. See it before you, my body up ahead.
CRAVER
How did you die?
REMZI
This Iraqi we shot dead isn't dead. He's almost dead, but he's got just enough strength to fire one more time. When I turn my back—bang!—he shoots me.
CRAVER
Where?
REMZI
In the neck.
CRAVER
Got it.
REMZI
So there I am in the sand, a bullet in my neck.
CRAVER
And it's hot. A fucking hot day and the sun is pissing a hole through my fucking hot head.
REMZI
Exactly and I'm dead.
CRAVER
But I'm alive.
REMZI
And glad to be that way.
CRAVER
But you were my buddy. We were friends. . . . Just friends or good friends?
REMZI
Pretty good friends.
CRAVER
Pretty good friends.
REMZI
Right. And now you have to cross the distance between us.
CRAVER
About thirty-five feet.
REMZI
And then you do it. The walk. The shortest and most important walk of your life. And you have to believe you can do it, with dignity in your stride, power, and, above all, a quiet sense of pride.
CRAVER
I'm ready.
REMZI
So am I
FAIROUZ
Keep your chin in the air at all times. As though your chin has a string attached to it that is pulling it up.
N
walking with grace.
LUE MING
It's all a matter of balance.
FAIROUZ
Not you again. I told you I don't know Galley.
LUE MING
Your friend Craver said you might know.
FAIROUZ
He's not my friend.
LUE MING
Are we still in Kentucky?
FAIROUZ
Yes.
LUE MING
American boys are so interesting! Full of secrets. All roads lead through him. My road. Your road. Dominoes in the dark.
FAIROUZ
Have you tried the other motel, across the street?
LUE MING
Calley's a soldier. A lieutenant. Of Charlie Company. A unit of the Americal Division's 11th Light Infantry Brigade. Very light. So light some thought he was an angel when he came home.
FAIROUZ
How do the women walk in your country?
LUE MING
Not as upright as we'd like. Hunched over a bit most of the time.
FAIROUZ
Show me.
LUE MING
[Shows her] The lower a body is to the ground, the less of a target.
FAIROUZ
I can't move without making noise. Clump, clump, clump. My mother always wanted me to walk with what she calls "presence." When I was in the fourth grade, I had to walk home from school.
LUE MING
Show me. How you walked home from school.
FAIROUZ
It was only three blocks. [She walks again.]
LUE MING
Yes. I think I remember it now.
FAIROUZ
There were some older children in the seventh grade. Two boys and a girl. They stopped me on the sidewalk. They wanted me to take off my shoes.
LUE MING
You should meet my mother; she has one foot.
FAIROUZ
To see the toes.
LUE MING
She stepped on a mine on her way for a piss.
FAIROUZ
Not the toes, but the hooves. They said I had hooves for toes. Devil's feet.
LUE MING
It was March 16,1968.
FAIROUZ
Devil's feet.
LUE MING
Why? You weren't even born then, were you?
FAIROUZ
[Chants] Devil's feet. Devil's feet.
LUE MING
Devil's feet?
FAIROUZ
Yes. [Chants] Fairouz has Devil's feet.
LUE MING
[Chants] Dirty Arab Devil, you go home.
FAIROUZ
[Chants] Dirty Arab Devil, you go home!
LUE MING
Get her shoe. Pull off her shoe.
FAIROUZ
Hold her down and pull off her shoe!
FAIROUZ 
[Chants] Dirty Arab, dirty Arab, you go home!
FAIROUZ
Remzi! [Beat] Remzi.
LUE MING
Arab! Slope! Dink!
FAIROUZ
No. They didn't call me that
LUE MING
Thought I'd throw it in. Slope. Dink. Gook.
FAIROUZ
Gook I've heard of.
LUE MING
The Philippines War. It was used again for Korea and then recycled for Vietnam. How did they get your shoe off?
FAIROUZ
I can't remember. I can figure the distance from right here, where we're standing, to the center of the earth, but I can't remember just how the shoe came off.
LUE MING
But it did come off? And when they saw you didn't have Devil's feet, did they let you be their friend?
FAIROUZ
A happy ending? It was for them. I think they were scared of me. Afterwards, they weren't.
LUE MING
And now you have a Devil's foot?
FAIROUZ
It does look a bit like a hoof now. The bone's curved wrong. Do you know what's happened to my brother?
LUE MING
I think we met each other once, but we were headed in different directions.
FAIROUZ
My God, where? Where did you see him?
LUE MING
I don't know anymore. We passed each other in a rather bad storm, and he reached out and touched my sleeve. Then he was gone.
FAIROUZ
Thank God. He's alive.
LUE MING
I didn't say that, my dear.
FAIROUZ
[Not listening] He's alive!
FAIROUZ
You're becoming a stranger.
REMZI
Look. I'm sorry about the occupation and that you don't feel you have a homeland, but I do. And it's here. Not over there in some never-never land.
FAIROUZ
I hardly recognize you.
REMZI
Iraq invaded a sovereign country. That's against international law.
FAIROUZ
International law? Ha! Your own land is overrun, occupied, slowly eaten up—
REMZI
[Mocks] village by village, orchard by orchard. Decades and decades of U.N. resolutions ...
FAIROUZ
And no one's ever smacked a Desert Shield on those bastards!
REMZI
There's just no parallel.
FAIROUZ
There's always a parallel. Did Mother ever tell you how she broke her hip before she came to America?
REMZI
She fell down when she was running away from the soldiers....
FAIROUZ
No. She was running towards the soldiers.
REMZI
I've heard this so many times it's a sweet little lullaby that could rock me to sleep. So Mother saved Father and they broke her hip with a rifle butt. Crack, crack. Bone broke. Hobble, hobble for the rest of her life. What do you expect me to do, hobble around for the rest of my life? You're so serious. Open your mouth and laugh for a change. You used to do that, remember? Get out of the house. Throw a party. Go to the Burger King on the corner and order some fries. [Beat] You're an American girl. Enjoy it.
FAIROUZ
I'm an Arab woman.
REMZI
You've never even been there.
FAIROUZ
Neither have you!
REMZI
If you walked into our village today, they'd tar and feather you.
FAIROUZ
Fuck you. I'd put on a veil.
REMZI
The veil's not the problem. You haven't been a virgin since you were thirteen.
FAIROUZ
How dare you!
REMZI
I'm sorry.
FAIROUZ
I was at least fourteen!
M
"The honor of a girl is like a piece of glass. If it's broken, you can never glue it together again."
REMZI
Why don't you tell her the truth?
FAIROUZ
It's my truth. Not hers. You hardly know her and she lives five minutes away!
REMZI
I can't talk to her.
FAIROUZ
Learn Arabic.
REMZI
No. She should learn English. She's been here over twenty years.
FAIROUZ
She speaks English. She just won't.
REMZI
Not until the day of liberation, right? You're still doing the shopping for her, aren't you?
FAIROUZ
In the stores, for years, she'd lift me in her arms and whisper in my ear, "Chubbes."
REMZI
"Chubbes."
FAIROUZ
And I would say, "Bread." "Halib" and I would say, "Milk."
REMZI
"Halib."
FAIROUZ
She's our mother.
REMZI
You were going to be a nurse, a doctor, or something. Get your degree. Get a job. I want a quiet life. As an American citizen. That's good enough for me. Beats living in the past.
FAIROUZ
An American citizen. What is that? This government pays for the guns that force us off our land.
REMZI
Allah, spare me! Jesus Christ. It's not my land. I'm not into redrawing maps or being trapped in the minds of crusty grandparents.
FAIROUZ
We're your family.
REMZI
Some family. More like a selection of Mesopotamian ruins.
FAIROUZ
Why don't you learn a little something about—
REMZI
About ruins?
FAIROUZ
the Intifada?
REMZI
What? They're finally letting the women out of their houses to throw stones.
FAIROUZ
We throw stones. We run unions. We go to prison. We get shot.
REMZI
Oh, martyrdom! Why don't you get out of the house and throw a few stones around here? You've got a big mouth, Fairouz, but your world is this
FAIROUZ
Ah, yes. Your friends. You tell your friends I was born that way.
REMZI
You're going to blame me that no one wants to marry a girl with a gimpy foot.
FAIROUZ
My foot is deformed, but my cunt works just fine!
REMZI
You have a mouth full of dirt, sister. What is it you want from me?
FAIROUZ
What I want? [She speaks some angry lines to him in Arabic.]
REMZI
Gibberish, Fairouz. Save it for the relatives.
FAIROUZ
If I could go to war with you, I'd shoot my enemies first; then I'd shoot the ones who made them my enemies.
REMZI
Enemies. Always the enemies.
FAIROUZ
There are three kinds of people. Those who kill. Those who die. And those who watch. Which one are you, Remzi? Which one are you? I know. I know which one you are, don't I?
REMZI
Go to hell. I was a kid. A child. You'll never let it go, will you?
FAIROUZ
I just don't want you to join up without knowing that sometimes I still hate you.
BOXLER
That's enough. Take a rest.
REMZI 
Yes, Lieutenant.
BOXLER
At ease.
CRAVER
Thank you, sir.
BOXLER
No sirs and thank-yous. We're equal when I say at ease. Where are you girls from? Haven't seen you around.
CRAVER
Echo Company A, 2, 3, sir.
REMZI
Those fatigues you have on. I don't think I've seen those kind before.
BOXLER
Special Forces.
CRAVER
I can smell the mothballs,
BOXLER
I like a sense of humor. [To REMZI] Where are you from, babe?
REMZI
The States.
BOXLER
I mean, where are your parents from?
REMZI
My father died when I was just a kid. My mother never told me where she was from.
BOXLER
Now that's not nice.... Parents owe the knowledge of their roots to their sons. A root must know its origins. You, my son, are a root living in the dark without a compass, and you have no idea what kind of tree is going to sprout forth from your skull. I'd say, American Indian, maybe. No. Could be your mommy is from Pakistan. Then again, could be South of the Border. It's hard to tell these days.
REMZI
Yes. It is.
BOXLER
But never mind. We're all family here, aren't we?
CRAVER
Do you know about the Sad Eyes, sir?
BOXLER
Boxler's my name. And of course I know about the Sad Eyes. I've seen them on the faces of many a soldier who comes back without his buddy at his side.
CRAVER
The weapon. Sad Eyes is a weapon.
BOXLER
That's what I love about war. The creativity of it. [Beat] Shall we?
CRAVER 
Ready, sir.
BOXLER
[As he speaks, he takes out a blindfold and puts it on. He gets to his knees.] Now, let's say you have a situation. A delicate situation. You've taken an Iraqi prisoner. He has a secret and you need to get this secret without breaking international law, the Geneva Constrictions, etc. Prisoners must be treated humanely. Please tie my hands behind my back.
REMZI
What's your name? I said
BOXLER
Be firm.
CRAVER
Tell us your name, shit bag, and we'll go easy on you.
BOXLER
That's an idea. Go on.
REMZI
One hand tied behind our backs?
BOXLER
You two dandelions aren't getting anywhere. Hey baby doll, yeah you, the one with the dark skin, are you a half-breed?
REMZI
No. But you are. [REMZI kicks him in the stomach.] You fucking sand nigger.
BOXLER
From what I can see of your face, you're a sand nigger yourself.
W
A sand nigger killing sand niggers.
REMZI
Sir? Did I hurt you, sir?
CRAVER
Oh shit.
BOXLER
[To REMZI] That was good. For a first time. [Suddenly he punches REMZI in the stomach.]
GRAVER
What about me, sir?
BOXLER
What about you?
CRAVER
How do I get that anger when I need it?
BOXLER
Where are you from?
CRAVER
Town of Hazard. Kentucky. Sir.
BOXLER
Let me see your teeth? Hmmm. Trash, are you?
CRAVER
Yes, sir.
BOXLER
Joined up because you couldn't get a job.
CRAVER
Yes, sir.
BOXLER
Father dead?
CRAVER
Yes, sir. The mines, sir.
BOXLER
Burned to a crisp in an explosion?
CRAVER
Suffocated. His lungs, sir.
BOXLER
A pity you weren't with him when he died.
CRAVER
It was like something sawing through wood. His breathing, sir. I couldn't stand to hear it. But the company wouldn't let him retire. He kept working. For the money, sir. We had to tie him into his chair to keep him at home.
BOXLER
Shat right there in his chair, did he? And you let your mother clean up his mess. Never offered her a hand. Tsk, tsk. Went out with your friends and got drunk on Pabst Blue Ribbon. But one night you came home early and he was still sitting there, tied to his chair. Your mother was passed out on the couch.
REMZI
Sir, this is ridicu—
BOXLER
[Interrupts] Yes, it is, isn't it? Because Craver then leaned over and said into his father's ear
CRAVER
When he went into the mines, he was my father. When he came back out, he was something else. I couldn't love something else.
BOXLER
And you were out fucking some pretty little box in the back of his Ford pickup truck the night he drew his last, painful breath. You shot your cum the moment his heart stopped,
REMZI
[To CRAVER] Don't listen to him, Craver.
CRAVER
That's where you're wrong. I didn't come. I never came.
BOXLER
And why not? [Beat] What was the problem? Are you a funny little boy, one of those ha-ha little boys?
CRAVER
What are you going to do about it? Report me? I'll break your fucking neck.
REMZI
Let's get out of here, Crave.
BOXLER
[To CRAVER] My, my. I can call your father a broken down, coal shitting, piss poor excuse for the American dream, and you don't bat an eye, but when I detect that you're a bit on the queer side ...
REMZI
Craver?
BOXLER
[Whispers] Faggot. Shit-fucker.
REMZI
Stop it!
BOXLER
Sodomite. Fairy. [Beat] Feel it? Feel it inside you, Mr. Perry? Now grab hold of it.
C
worthless without refinement. But you've got to know where to direct it. Out there, my friend.
CRAVER
That's not how it happened. [Beat] Sir.
BOXLER
You can give his death any reason you want. Facts are not infallible. They are there to be interpreted in a way that's udeful to you. Why, your president does it, and he is no smarter than you. President Johnson says—
REMZI
President Bush.
BOXLER
Whatever the hell his name is, he said
REMZI
This is a different war, sir.
BOXLER
The tonnage dropped by the Allies in World War II was only three million. Now, my hands won't be tied behind my back when we go into Panama City. Operation Just Because, it will be called.
CRAVER
It was called Operation Just Cause. Just Cause.
REMZI
That was in '89. In December.
BOXLER
I'll be driving a tank there. They promised me I could drive a tank this time. The only nuisance is that crunching sound under my treads. A crunching sound, like this. [Makes the sound, shivers] Civilians have so little consideration.
CRAVER
You were never in Panama, sir.
REMZI
There were no civilian deaths to speak of.
BOXLER
But not to speak of, I'd say about three thousand. Now, when we went into the barrios of Grenada .. .
REMZI
Just where haven't you been, sir?
CRAVER
To hell. He hasn't been to hell, but he's on his way there.
BOXLER
Oh, there you're wrong. I stood outside the gates for a very long time. In rain and snow, fire and brimstone, but they wouldn't let me in. I don't know why they won't let me in.
LUE MING
Fairouz! Fairouz!
BOXLER
Now we're ready for lesson two
BOXLER
Hear it?
FAIROUZ
[Offstage, calling] Remzi! Remzi!
FAIROUZ
I can see through it anyway.
LUE MING
This is how we must operate
FAIROUZ
Like a bat?
LUE MING
If you like. Now. Think past the obstacles, that which hides your objective. Map out the lie of the land as you remember it and have never seen it.
FAIROUZ
And forget the motel carpet?
LUE MING
Hands up! Don't you know there's a war on? Keep your head. Look for what is not there.
FAIROUZ
Imagine the land I can't see.
LUE MING
Once, an American soldier called himself my brother.
FAIROUZ
Sounds like a friendly war.
LUE MING
In the first years the soldiers gave us toffee and boiled sweets.
FAIROUZ
By the rice paddies? In Saigon?
LUE MING
Tu Cung, actually. By the coast. [Beat] Rush always gave me gum, Juicy Fruit gum. He called me his little sis. Once he gave me a ribbon to put in my hair. I had very long hair, beautiful, thick hair that I wore in a braid down my back. [Beat] But one day Rush didn't bring any gum, and he took out his knife and cut off my braid.
FAIROUZ
Was it a slow knife? Serrated are slow.
LUE MING
Oh no, it was a quick knife, a Rush knife, and he strapped my hair to the back of his helmet. His friends laughed and laughed. Rush looked so very silly with his camouflage helmet on and this long black braid hanging down his back.
FAIROUZ
It was only hair.
LUE MING
I'd be careful if I were blindfolded.
FAIROUZ
I like it. I could go anywhere in the world right now, and to do it I wouldn't have to lift a finger.
LUE MING
Or a foot.
FAIROUZ
I'm four hundred thirty miles from home. This is the first time I've been outside of Atlanta. The first time I've flown in a plane.
LUE MING
I despise flying. It puts my hair in a tangle.
FAIROUZ
Could you get a message to Remzi?
LUE MING
Your brother's not accepting messages these days.
FAIROUZ
I'm sorry, but I don't have time for your lost braid. What's done is done. My brother is alive, and we must think about the living and wait for my brother to send word. [Beat] I'm sick of waiting. And I can't stop waiting.
LUE MING
Those who wait burn.
FAIROUZ
Did you get the vaccines you needed?
REMZI
Yesterday.
FAIROUZ
Then everything's in order?
REMZI
All set to leave. The big adventure awaits me. Little brother goes to war.
FAIROUZ
When we were small, the children from our school would come to our house to have a look at my funny foot. You made them pay a dime each time they had a look.
REMZI
I split the profit with you, fifty-fifty.
FAIROUZ
It was my foot.
REMZI
It was my idea.
FAIROUZ
I used to lie awake at night, for years, dreaming of ways to kill you. I THOUGHT
REMZI
For hating me?
FAIROUZ
Yes. Then you wouldn't be surprised by the hate of the world.
CRAVER
[Offstage] Remzi! Remzi!
FAIROUZ
Listen to me. You don't have the right balance. 1 do. You see, I love you, but I hate you too. I have to. Tightly, tightly. As though at any moment either of us could slip off this earth. Are you listening to me?
LUE MING
[Answering as REMZI] Yes, I am, Fairouz. I'm listening.
FAIROUZ
Go say good-bye to Mother. She's in her room and she won't come out. She says they'll kill you. Just like they killed father.
LUE MING
That was an accident and you know it. He fell onto the lily pads and into the pond and drowned.
FAIROUZ
His face was messed up. As though he'd been hit many times.
LUE MING
Water can do that to a face.
FAIROUZ
I've told Mother that, Remzi. Over and over I've told her that it's the Iraqis you're going off to fight, but she keeps saying [speaks in Arabic and then translates] "They'll kill him. The Yankees will kill him." Silly old woman. She's all mixed up.
REMZI
"Tabun." "Mawid." "Zbib, trab ahmar, dibs."
CRAVER
Sounds like you had a good leave.
REMZI
Zbib, trab alunan dibs. Raisins. Red soil. Molasses.
CRAVER
Really? How amazing,...
REMZI
I went to visit my father's village. On the western side of the Hebron Mountains. Al-Dawayima. According to my mother, there were 559 houses there.
CRAVER
I didn't know you were back.
REMZI
Tall grasses, wild flowers, scrubs. That's all that's there now. Dozers have flattened the houses.
CRAVER
When did you get back?
REMZI
I went to the refugee camp nearby, but I couldn't speak the language. I could point, though.
CRAVER
We went on alert a couple of times. Lucky we didn't start without you.
REMZI
A Palestinian farmer explained to me that there are three varieties of fig suitable for preserving
CRAVER
You're a Palestinian.
REMZI
One old woman took me in for coffee because I didn't know anyone and had nowhere to go. She called me "Yankee Palestina." These people lose their homes. They live in poverty, and they're the enemies of the world. [Throws CRAVER a bag of figs] I brought that for you.
CRAVER
Nice you remembered I existed. I think of the three, I'm the white fig variety. How do you say it?
REMZI
Abiyad.
CRAVER
Yeah. Abiyad. [He tastes a fig.] These are nasty.
REMZI
You're not eating them right. You don't just plug them in your mouth like a wad of chewing tobacco. You've got to eat them with a sense of purpose.
CRAVER
With a quiet sense of pride?
REMZI
Exactly.
CRAVER
Nastier than the first one.
REMZI
No. Look. You're gobbling.
CRAVER
Why didn't you buy me a souvenir, like a nice little prayer rug?
REMZI
Eating is like walking. My sister taught me that. There's a balance involved. You have to eat the fig gently. As though it were made of the finest paper.
CRAVER
[After some moments of silence] Did you take a lot of pictures?
REMZI
On the streets of Atlanta I've been called every name you can think of
CRAVER
[Sincerely] Haven't any idea.
REMZI
So. What's on for tomorrow?
CRAVER
Drills. Red alert. Stop. Go. Stop. Go.
REMZI
Every day it's anyday now.
CRAVER
I just want it to start.
LUE MING
Your shoulders are too tight. That's what they look for. Tight shoulders, pinched faces.
FAIROUZ
My face isn't pinched.
LUE MING
If you're going to find your brother, you have to cross borders. But not with sweat on your upper lip. Try it again. Not a care in the world. Right at home. [LUE MING assumes the posture of an immigration officer.] Passport? Hmmm. North American?
LUE MING
Tourist?
FAIROUZ
Yes.
LUE MING
How long?
FAIROUZ
Most of my life, sir.
LUE MING
[Speaks as herself] Don't be perverse. [Speaks as officer] First time out of the United States?
FAIROUZ
Yes.
LUE MING
Relatives here?
FAIROUZ
Yes. I mean, no. I mean I do, but they
LUE MING
[Interrupts] Just what do you mean, Miss ... Saboura?
FAIROUZ
My parents were born here.
LUE MING
Here? Born here?
FAIROUZ
Yes.
LUE MING
You mean right where I'm standing? [She lifts her feet and looks under them.]
FAIROUZ
[Looks at LUE MING's boots] Yes. [Beat] Where did you get those?
LUE MING
Do you think they're stuck to my shoes?
FAIROUZ
I know those boots. What?
LUE MING
Your parents. Do you think they're stuck to my shoes?
FAIROUZ
I don't understand.
LUE MING
I assure you it was an accident. One minute they're alive and well; the next minute they're under my shoes.
FAIROUZ
My brother is lost.
LUE MING
Lucky man.
FAIROUZ
I'm Palestin . ..
LUE MING
Don't say it! Don't say it! It's like a bee that flies into my ear and fornicates there.
FAIROUZ
Don't you think you're overdoing it?
LUE MING
You must be prepared for them to throw anything at you. [Plays officer again] Purpose of your visit?
FAIROUZ
Your ruins.
LUE MING
Yes. Lots of ruins. I like ruins. Your voice reminds me of one. Are you sad? Are you missing someone close to your heart? Pull up your shirt. I don't have all day.
FAIROUZ
Doctor. I haven't finished the degree.
LUE MING
Ah, a person who quits?
FAIROUZ
I plan to go back.
LUE MING
You can't go back to Al-Dawayima. There's no place to go back to. [Beat] So you're Arab?
FAIROUZ
American.
LUE MING
American?
FAIROUZ
Arab.
LUE MING
Make up your mind!
FAIROUZ
I'm a Palestinian-Arab-American. From Atlanta. Sir.
FAIROUZ
Did he talk to you about his visit to the Territories?
CRAVER
Not a word.
FAIROUZ
He never likes to learn anything new.
CRAVER
Ever heard of the Beehive? It's the ultimate concept in improved fragmentation. It spins at high velocity, spitting out eighty-eight hundred fléchettes.
FAIROUZ
Fléchettes?
CRAVER
Tiny darts with razor-sharp edges capable of causing deep wounds.
FAIROUZ
What is a deep wound? How deep exactly?
CRAVER
To the bone. You should leave now.
FAIROUZ
I got a letter from the army.
CRAVER
Know the DU penetrator? Cigar-shaped, armor-piercing bullets. The core of the bullet is made from radioactive nuclear waste.
FAIROUZ
They say he's missing.
CRAVER
When fired, the DU's uranium core bursts into flame. Ever had forty tons of depleted uranium dumped in your backyard?
FAIROUZ
Not in action, just missing.
CRAVER
Things get lost. People
FAIROUZ
Get lost. But why not you? Why didn't you get lost?
CRAVER
Because I fell in love. In our bunkers at night, Remzi used to read the names out loud to us, and it calmed us down. He must have read that weapons manual a hundred times. All those ways to kill the human body. Lullabies. It was like . .. they were always the same and always there and when we said them to ourselves, there was nothing else like it
FAIROUZ
Did you love my brother?
CRAVER
I can't remember.
FAIROUZ
But you can. You will. Remember!
CRAVER
I remember .. . what my first... favorite was
FAIROUZ
Alright, let's try something more simple.
CRAVER
It has survived in frontline service for three generations.
FAIROUZ
Not about numbers this time, but about flesh.
CRAVER
It has an engine thrust of thirteen thousand seven hundred fifty pounds and a maximum speed of five hundred ninety-five mph. It's slow, but it's bad.
FAIROUZ
If you could give his flesh a velocity?
CRAVER
The Buffs, better known as B-52s, won the Gulf War. Not the smarts. Not the smarts.
FAIROUZ
Or a number, what would it be?
CRAVER
Ninety-three percent of the bombs dropped were free falls from the bellies of Fat Fellows.
FAIROUZ
If you could give his flesh a number?
CRAVER
Only seven percent were guided, and of these half-wits, forty percent missed their targets.
FAIROUZ
A number that's short of infinity? Was that your desire for him?
CRAVER
Forty to forty-five percent of the smarts ... they missed....
FAIROUZ
Something short of infinity?
CRAVER
They missed their targets.
FAIROUZ
Did you or did you not fuck him?
CRAVER
That [beat] is a lot of missed targets.
FAIROUZ
Okay. Mr. White Trash Likes Arab Ass, yes? Is it good? Is it sweet like white ass? Do you find it exotic?
CRAVER
I'm not that kind of a soldier.
FAIROUZ
He could be a bastard, my brother. But if you fucked him and then hurt him in any way, I'll tear your heart out.
CRAVER
Remzi never said he had a sister with a limp. His sister, he said, she walked like a princess.
FAIROUZ
Was he gentle with you? Sometimes when we were children, he would soak my foot in a bowl of warm water, with lemon and orange rinds. He would blow on my toes to dry them. He thought if he cared for my foot, day by day, and loved it, that somehow it would get better. [Beat] What was it like to kiss him?
CRAVER
After the Buffs it was the GR Mk-1 Jaguar with two Rolls Royce Adour Mk 102 turbofans. A fuselage pylon and four wing pylons can carry up to ten thousand pounds of armaments....
REMZI
The Jag can carry a mix of cannons, Smarts, and gravity bombs. And get this—maximum speed
CRAVER
Then there's the brain of the electronic warfare central nervous system
REMZI
If there ever was an indispensable weapon, it is the E-3 AWACS, capable of directing U.N. forces with tremendous accuracy. Improvements include
CRAVER
A better Have Quick radar jamming system and an upgraded JTIDS. Able to manage hundreds of warplanes airborne at any given moment.
REMZI
At any given moment?
CRAVER
Any given moment.
REMZI
How about now?
CRAVER
We could go to jail. It's illegal in the Army.
REMZI
So are white phosphorous howitzer shells. So are fuel-air explosives.
CRAVER
We don't decide what gets dropped.
REMZI
Would you kiss me if I were dead?
CRAVER
Why would I kiss you if you were dead?
REMZI
Would you kiss me if 1 were alive?
CRAVER
I had a thing for the Sentry jet, but how long can love last, after the first kiss, after the second, still around after the third? I dumped the Sentry jet and went on to the Wild Weasel, F-4G. Like a loyal old fire horse, the Weasel was back in action.
REMZI
Have you ever touched the underbelly of a recon plane? Two General Electric J79-15 turbojets.
CRAVER
If you run your hand along its flank, just over the hip, to rear end, it will go wet. Not damp, but I mean wet.
REMZI
Have you ever run your face over the wing of an A-6 Intruder or opened your mouth onto the tail of a AV-8B Harrier II? It's not steel you taste. It's not metal.
CRAVER
Ever had a Phoenix missile at the tip of your tongue? Nine hundred and eighty-five pounds of power, at launch.
FAIROUZ
Is that how you kissed him?
CRAVER
I kissed a girl for the first time when I was twelve. She had a mouth full of peanut butter and jelly and that's what I got. Have you ever seen an airplane take off vertically? That's what I was when I kissed Remzi, like the AV-8B Harrier II, straight up into the air, no runway, no horizontal run, but VTO, vertical takeoff.
FAIROUZ
Why don't you say it?
CRAVER
One Rolls Royce turbojet going up, engine thrust, twenty-one thousand pounds, maximum speed
FAIROUZ
Please. Just say it.
CRAVER
Forever. Remzi said to me the first time he kissed me, "What are you now, Craver Perry? A White Trash River Boy Who Kisses Arabs and Likes It?" I said, "I'm a White-Trash-River-Boy-Arab-Kissing Faggot." And the rest, as they say, is history. [Beat] Remzi was, as they say, history, too.
FAIROUZ
Remzi is dead, isn't he?
CRAVER
I said he was history. That's something else.
FAIROUZ
How can this be funny to you?
CRAVER
If you saw your brother lying dead in the sand, just what would you say to him? Imagine it. There he is. Dead on the sand. A bullet in his neck.
FAIROUZ
Bled to death?
GRAVER
Maybe. What would you do?
FAIROUZ
What was it for? You're of no use to me. Just a dead brother now. Zero. No more Remzi to hate. No more Remzi...
REMZI
[Talking to her gently] Just once more.
FAIROUZ
I can't. I can't.
REMZI
You've got to do it, or you'll never walk right. Just once more.
FAIROUZ
Just once more. Only once more. Will it be better then?
REMZI
Soon. It will be better soon.
LUE MING
My sweet. My love. Come out from your hiding. Oh, my little angel, my tropical fish. Swim to me through the corridors of air. I am waiting for you. Come home. Come home. [Beat] Yes. Yes. It's you.
BOXLER
Boxler.
LUE MING
Is that it now, Boxler?
BOXLER
I have nothing to say to you.
LUE MING
You're looking so well. So robust. So alive. And happy?
BOXLER
When I'm training my girls.
LUE MING
And what do you teach them?
BOXLER
Are you enjoying your visit?
LUE MING
Some of your cities make me feel right at home. Burned out, bodies in the street, the troops restoring order. They're so much like Vietnam.
BOXLER
You're Vietcong, aren't you?
LUE MING
I hear your record sold over two hundred thousand copies. You're a pop star.
BOXLER
That was thirty... twenty-five ...
LUE MING
Twenty-one years ago. Just how much time did you get?
BOXLER
I got labor for life, but three days later I was out of the stockade, courtesy of President Nick. Then I got thirty-five months in my bachelor pad at Fort Benning with my dog, my mynah bird, and my tank full of tropical fish,
LUE MING
Could you sing it for me? That song? [Sings the following to the tune of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic"]
BOXLER
I'm a hero, you know. I'm a hero and you're a dead gook.
LUE MING
Don't try to sweet-talk me. It won't work.
BOXLER
They took care of me. Friends in high places. I have a jewelry store and a Mercedes. I have a lot to be grateful for.
LUE MING
Have you missed me terribly?
BOXLER
I'm sorry, but I can't place you.
LUE MING
Take a look at my face, closely.
BOXLER
Nope.
LUE MING
You'll remember the walk. There is no one in the world who walks like Lue Ming. [She walks.]
BOXLER
Sorry.
LUE MING
How is it I can remember you and you can't remember me?
BOXLER
What's done is done.
REMZI
One, two. And there. Three. Look at it. Cotton candy. Carnival. Dancing. Craver. You're missing it. That one! [Beat] "And all the king's horses and all the king's men ..."
REMZI
Do you think he really wanted to be whole again?
CRAVER
Who?
REMZI
The egg.
CRAVER
What?
REMZI
Do you think he wanted to be put back together?
CRAVER
How the hell should I know what an egg wants?
REMZI
I should be dead, but I'm not.
CRAVER
[Sings] Happy birthday, Baghdad.
REMZI
I think he was tired of being a good egg.
CRAVER
Make a wish.
REMZI
Yeah. A birthday.
CRAVER
If you sit out in the dark, they light up all around you. Like that. Back in Hazard. Just like that. All over the sky. Fireflies. There—
REMZI
That first time.
CRAVER
And then gone. There—
REMZI
Like. It was like—
CRAVER
And then gone.
REMZI
I was a window and you put your hand through me.
BOXLER
You're not bad looking.
LUE MING
I know.
BOXLER
But I could never touch you. I mean, really touch you. I mean, I know you are human, but well. [Beat] I was a child once. Hard to believe, isn't it? I had
LUE MING
My three-year-old daughter had a blanket made from two scarves my mother sewed together.
BOXLER
I had a father I loved and a mother I loved, and then I went to school.
LUE MING
Show me what you teach the boys. Show me.
BOXLER
My teacher made us sit in a formation, with the whitest faces up front in the first row, then the second and third row for the olive skins and half-breeds, and the fourth and fifth rows for the dark ones.
LUE MING
Remember, you have a situation. [Sheputs on a blindfold.] You've captured a Vietcong, and you need to know the whereabouts of the others. Now be polite. You're an American soldier and that means something.
BOXLER
Did you know they made bumper stickers with my name on it?
LUE MING
You know who I am.
BOXLER
[He pulls her hair.] Shut your squawking, bitch. [Calls] Hey, you two troopers. Over here on the double.
CRAVER
The, dozers are clearing the area, sir.
BOXLER
Get on with it. What 'dozers?
REMZI
We're mopping up.
BOXLER
I said, Make her talk!
CRAVER
Can you tell us where Saddam's minefields are?
BOXLER
This is Vietnam, son.
REMZI
We're in Iraq, sir.
BOXLER
This is Panama City!
CRAVER
We have the Dragon M-47 assault missile, sir. Couldn't we use that instead?
BOXLER
Duty is face-to-face confession, son. Between two people. You and this prisoner. Well, go on. Take down your pants.
CRAVER
Sir?
BOXLER
Take down your pants. [To LUE MING] Suck him.
LUE MING
[To CRAVER] Haven't we met before?
BOXLER
Suck him or I'll cut your head off. [CRAVER unzips his pants. Lue Ming begins to sing a Vietnamese lullaby.] Jesus. Can't you even give her something to suck?
CRAVER
It's the singing, sir.
BOXLER
Remzi. Go get her kid. It's in the hut.
REMZI
What hut, sir? We're in the middle of a desert.
BOXLER
Get her fucking kid and bring it here, or I'll cut his dick off.
REMZI
What kid, sir?
BOXLER
What kid? There's always a kid.
LUE MING
The child is right here. In my arms.
REMZI
We're moving out. Now, sir.
CRAVER
Remzi.
REMZI
Let's go.
LUE MING
I so much prefer it like this. The two of us. Alone.
REMZI
Ancient Mesopotamia.
CRAVER
[Sings] Hot dogs. Armor hot dogs. What kind of kids eat Armor hot dogs?
REMZI
[Sings] Fat kids, sissy kids, kids that climb on rocks.
CRAVER
[Sings] Tough kids, skinny kids, even kids with—
REMZI 
[Sings] . .. chicken pox! Love hot dogs. Armor hot dogs. The dogs kids love to bite.
CRAVER
I always loved that song when I was a kid.
REMZI
It made me feel included.
CRAVER
Yeah.
REMZI
Which kid were you—the fat kid?
CRAVER
The tough kid.
REMZI
Of course.
CRAVER
Some of those fuckers were still moving.
REMZI
Right here, where we're sitting, long ago they gave us the zero and the wheel.
CRAVER
Civilians.
REMZI
Irrigation and organized religion and large-scale trade.
CRAVER
But there are no civilians in Iraq.
REMZI
Laws and cities and schools. [Beat] That was in 2000 B.C.
REMZI
The first poet known in history.
GRAVER
Those pilots took whatever bombs they could get their hands on, even the clusters and five-hundred pounders.
REMZI
A woman called Enheduanna.
GRAVER
Imagine dropping a five - h u η d re d - ρ o u η d bomb on a Volkswagen! Every moving thing. Terminated. Thirty fucking miles of scrap metal, scrap meat. All scrapped. [He lets out a howl that, is half celebration and half terror.] And I've never seen guys dig that fast. Forty-nine holes.
REMZI
They were going home. We shot them in the back. There are laws regarding warfare.
CRAVER
You're going to get out of the truck this time.
REMZI
I can't.
CRAVER
Yes, you can and I'll make you.
REMZI
Don't ask me to do it, Craver. I'm warning you.
CRAVER
But I have to. Get out of the truck this time and walk along the road with me. Get out of the truck this time and help me. Help me.
REMZI
No.
CRAVER
Someone has to do it.
REMZI
But not you!
CRAVER
Fuck off.
REMZI
What was it like, you son of a bitch? To carry a man's leg?
CRAVER
We were ordered to pick up
REMZI
[Interrupts] To carry a man's leg when the man is no longer attached?
CRAVER
To pick up the pieces and put them in the holes. The dozers covered the pieces we found with sand.
REMZI
Is that what you think we're doing, burying them?
CRAVER
We buried them.
REMZI
We're covering them up. So no one will ever know. I saw you, Craver. I saw you.
CRAVER
It was like the limb of a tree. No. It was like the branch of a tree. That's how heavy it was. I said to myself, "Craver, you're not carrying what you think you're carrying. It's just a piece of tree. For the fire. And you're out in your backyard in Hazard, Kentucky, and he's still alive, my father, and my mother still laughs, and we're having a bar-b-que. And I can smell the coals."
REMZI
One of the bodies I saw ... it was very... burned. In one of the vans. For a minute I thought. Well. He looked like ... Maybe it was the sun on my head. I don't know. [Beat] I put my finger inside his mouth. I wanted to touch him someplace where he wasn't [beat] burned.
CRAVER
Touch me.
REMZI
Every fucking time it tastes different with you. No.
CRAVER
You didn't try and stop it, did you? [Shouts] Did you?
REMZI
Why are we here [beat] killing Arabs?
BOXLER
Trust me. I'm the man with the box. The amnesty box. And this time I'm in ... Iraq. Is that right? [Beat] This box you see before you is a very special box. It's a common device we use here within the military, a receptacle in which soldiers can relieve themselves of contraband, no questions asked. Would you like to drop something in it? You can't take those bits and pieces home with you. No, no, no. I've already made the rounds with the other troops. You aren't alone.
LUE MING
March 16,1968. Charlie Company...
BOXLER
A unit of the Americal Divisions 11th Light Infantry Brigade entered
LUE MING
Attacked.
BOXLER
Attacked an undefended village on the coast of Central Vietnam and took the lives
LUE MING
Murdered.
BOXLER
And murdered approximately five hundred old men, women, and children. The killing took place over four hours. Sexual violations . ..
LUE MING
Rape, sodomy.
BOXLER
Anatomical infractions.
LUE MING
Unimaginable mutilations.
BOXLER
Unimaginable. Yes. By the time I went to trial, public opinion was in my favor. T-shirts, buttons, mugs. One company wanted to put my face on a new cereal.
LUE MING
And my daughter?
BOXLER
It's over now. They say it's over.
LUE MING
The past is never over,
BOXLER
The war is over.
LUE MING
Which one?
BOXLER
Do you have anything you want to put in the box?
LUE MING
Can I take something out?
BOXLER
It's supposed to be a one way thing.
LUE MING
Give the box to me. Give the box—
BOXLER
[Interrupts] I can't do that.
LUE MING
Give the box to me, or I'll hunt you across this desecrated world forever. [Beat] You owe me a favor.
BOXLER
Can we call it quits?
REMZI
Stop it. Get off of me! Stop it!
FAIROUZ
I'm going to tickle you until you pee in your pants. What will the other soldiers say?
REMZI
You're so jealous. You can't stand me leaving.
FAIROUZ
Let's meet up in the Territories.
REMZI
You'll have to come out of the house!
FAIROUZ
We could look for the village where we might have been born. We could go exploring, find relatives, take photos, and—
REMZI
[Interrupts] If I get a leave, I'm going to go somewhere ... fun. With my buddies. [Beat] Hey. But I'll tell you what. I am going to send you back something very special
REMZI
Maybe I'll even fall in love over there and bring somebody home with me. They do that in wars. Come back with lovers and wives.
FAIROUZ
If you fall in love, will you let me meet him?
REMZI
Now you're going to be punished for your foul and lecherous tongue! [He grabs her foot and begins to tickle it.]
REMZI
[Playfully] Oops. Sorry!
FAIROUZ
Stop it. Stop it!
LUE MING
[Interrupts] Fairouz. I'll be back in a few months. Don't do anything rash. Just wait till I get back.
FAIROUZ
Those who wait, burn. [Knowing now that it is LUE MING] They won't send home the body.
FAIROUZ
The Army won't send home the body.
CRAVER
What's it matter? It's just a body. It's not him.
FAIROUZ
I want to see his body. It belongs to us.
CRAVER
It. It. Just what the fuck are you talking about? He's gone. I don't want anything to do with it.
FAIROUZ
I think I twisted it again.
GRAVER
You should see a doctor. Let me see.
FAIROUZ
I don't usually show men my foot unless I take my pants off first.
LUE MING
[To REMZI] Devil's feet, devil's feet, devil's feet.
CRAVER
May I?
FAIROUZ
You want to kiss my foot?
CRAVER
Yes.
REMZI
[Chants with a deadpan voice] Fairouz Saboura has devil's feet.
FAIROUZ
Because you want to make it better?
LUE MING
[Chants] Dirty Arab Devil, you go home!
FAIROUZ
Or because I told you he used to do that?
REMZI
[Chants] Dirty Arab Devil, you go home!
LUE MING
[Chants] Get her shoe. Pull off her shoe.
CRAVER
Both.
REMZI
[Chants] Hold her down and pull off her shoe.
CRAVER
For both reasons.
FAIROUZ
Alright.
REMZI
No!
FAIROUZ
Don't.
REMZI
Get the fuck off her, you motherfuckers!
FAIROUZ
Remzi!
BOXLER
[To REMZI] We had an Iraqi prisoner. I stuck the knife in just below the sternum.
CRAVER
I won't hurt you.
BOXLER
[To REMZI] And I slit him all the way down.
REMZI
All of you! Back off!
BOXLER
I pulled his rib cage wide open—
REMZI
Leave her alone!
BOXLER
... and stood inside his body. I said
REMZI
Fairouz!
BOXLER
Hey boys, now I'm really standing in Iraq.
CRAVER
I promise you, I won't hurt you.
CRAVER
Bitch.
REMZI
Get away from her!
CRAVER
Fucking ... Arab whore.
REMZI
Get away from her. I'm warning you!
FAIROUZ
Take a look, Craver. This isn't a B-52, This isn't a B.U.F.F. This is a hammer. I could do to your face what they did to my foot.
GRAVER
Go on then. You fucking gimp. Go on. Do it! Hit me!
FAIROUZ
How do you remember him now? [She presses the face of the hammer into his mouth and moves it sexually.] Like this?
REMZI
No!
CRAVER
No.
FAIROUZ
How did he die?
CRAVER
Every single bone. We tried. Day after day, but there were too many pieces. We couldn't get them all. Do you know how many pieces make up the human body? Two, three hundred thousand. [Beat] Dead. Maybe half of them civilians. We bombed the sewers, the electricity, the water. They'll die in the thousands because of bad water. Just bad water.
FAIROUZ
Give me an answer.
CRAVER
They came for us. Both of us.
FAIROUZ
But you're still alive.
CRAVER
The question here isn't how many feet were between Remzi and me. It could have been thirty feet. Or twenty-five. I think it was more like twenty.
FAIROUZ
Tell me.
CRAVER
I had practiced it with him. I got it down just right. Do you want to see how I walked? [CRAVER does his "walk" for her as she watches him.] Are you watching me? [He continues his "walk."]
BOXLER
I remember you. I think I do. Is that what you want? An apology? Why didn't you just say so? Hey. Really. I'm sincerely sorry. I've always been sorry. Besides, I wasn't completely heartless. You didn't know I shot your kid because I shot you first.
LUE MING
You said you'd let her live if I did what you wanted. You couldn't get it up. That's why you killed us both.
BOXLER
I had a war on my mind.
LUE MING
What is it like to kill a child?
BOXLER
You're sick.
LUE MING
I have to know.
BOXLER
It's simple
LUE MING
Were you ever in love?
BOXLER
Oh yes. Long ago. I was born a human being, you know. But one can't stay that way forever. One has to mature. [Beat] Maybe it was you I fell in love with. I mean, it could have happened, couldn't it?
LUE MING
Why wasn't one time enough?
BOXLER
Because I wanted to kiss you again. Naturally.
LUE MING
Why did you have to shoot her twice? Three times? Just to make sure?
BOXLER
Just to make sure, I did it four times. And shooting a child, if you must know, is rather exceptional. It's like shooting an angel. There's something religious about it.
LUE MING
I woke up after you and your troops were gone. I woke up with my child in my arms. A dead child weighs so much more than a live one. I carried her back to the village. When I was well again, I continued my work with the Vietcong. I was one of their top commanders. I searched for you everywhere. Everywhere. With more passion than one would a lost lover. But I never found you.
BOXLER
Just how did you die?
BOXLER
Galley is still alive and well in Georgia. Only I've run out on him. I'm his soul. Calley's dead soul.
LUE MING
His soul?
BOXLER
Yes, his soul, and I'm homeless.
LUE MING
I don't believe in souls.
BOXLER
Neither do I, but here I am. I go from war to war. It's the only place that feels like home. I didn't kill your daughter. Calley did. I was inside him, looking out, but I didn't do it. I didn't pull the trigger.
LUE MING
You watched.
BOXLER
What else can a soul do but watch? We're not magicians.
LUE MING
Are you suffering?
BOXLER
I can't suffer. I can't and it hurts me.
LUE MING
Is it terrible?
BOXLER
It tears me apart.
LUE MING
How long will this go on?
BOXLER
World without end.
LUE MING
Delightful. More than I'd hoped. [Beat] But I want you to make a sound for me.
BOXLER
No.
LUE MING
You owe it to me.
FAIROUZ
[Calls] Remzi.
BOXLER
I don't know what you're talking about.
FAIROUZ 
The sound—
FAIROUZ
. . . you made inside you. Not the second time.
LUE MING
Not the third or fourth. But the first time you died.
BOXLER
The first time I died.
LUE MING
Yes.
BOXLER
That would be sometime in November, 1967. There was an old man. He was wounded. He wouldn't have made it anyway. I threw him down a well.
REMZI
[To CRAVER] I couldn't say it. any louder. I whispered her name. [Whispers] Fairouz.
CRAVER
[Whispers] Fairouz.
REMZI
There were five of them.
FAIROUZ
Go on.
BOXLER
I threw him down a well. An old man. I heard his head go crack against the stone wall and then splash.
REMZI
One of the boys had just come out of woodshop. He'd been making an end table for his mother for Christmas. He had a hammer.
CRAVER
You were a kid, Remzi.
BOXLER
I was a child once. Did you know that? 1 liked to run naked and jump up and down on the bed. I had a bath toy. A blue bath toy. I can't remember what it was.
REMZI
They got one of her shoes off. Then the sock. I stood behind the bushes and watched.
CRAVER
You looked out for yourself. That was right.
REMZI
I was afraid that if I tried to stop them, they'd do the same to me.
CRAVER
Shhhhhhhhh.
BOXLER
I threw him down the well. And I heard a crack. I heard a splash. I heard a crack and a splash and I died.
CRAVER
You were just a kid.
FAIROUZ
You were just a child.
BOXLER
When I killed him, I died, though I didn't make a sound when I died. My body just turned and walked back into the village to finish the rest of the job.
LUE MING
But I heard it. I heard the splash. And I heard you die.
FAIROUZ
Do you want to know what it sounds like?
LUE MING
What it sounds like to go on living and the child in your arms is so heavy and she is dead and you are dead and I am dead but—
FAIROUZ
We just keep living.
BOXLER
Forever and ever.
LUE MING
It sounded like this
CRAVER
That's beautiful. Sad Eyes. The CBUs were prohibited weapons, like the napalm, cluster, and fragmentation. But Sad Eyes. Who would have had the heart to try and stop a weapon named Sad Eyes? Eyes like his. Not sad, really. But confused. Or furious. Or scared.
T

REMZI
You are my white trash and I love you.
CRAVER 
You are my white trash and I love you.
CRAVER
They caught us together, out behind the barracks. They were lower ranks. Just kids. Like me. Kids who grew up with garbage in their backyards. Kids who never got the summer jobs, who didn't own CD players. They knocked us around. After awhile, they took us to a room. Handed us over to an upper rank. There was a British officer and an Iraqi prisoner in there, too, and they were laughing and saying, "Sandnigger. Indian. Gook." [Beat] Remzi. Well. He went wild. He jumped one of those officers. I was standing there. I couldn't move. I couldn't. . .. Then somebody hit me over the head and I went out. [Beat] The first time I came to, the prisoner was down and he kept waving his arms like he was swimming, doing the backstroke, and Remzi was there and I could hear his voice, but it was like trying to see through a sheet of ice. [Beat] My head was spinning and it was snowing stars. In that room. In the middle of the biggest bunch of hottest nowhere in the world and it was snowing stars and Remzi in the center of it and this one officer or maybe it was two and there was a knife and the Iraqi had stopped moving—I think he was dead—and they were all over him and having a good time at it. Like kids in the snow. [Beat] Do you want to know how you died, Remzi?
REMZI
Friendly fire.
CRAVER
One of them had his arm around my neck, choking me, while another one held you down. I shouted for you to stay down but you wouldn't stay down. Each time he knocked you down you stood up. He hit you in the mouth so many times I couldn't tell anymore what was your nose and what was your mouth. [Beat] What did you call the other soldiers when you first joined up?
REMZI
Family.
CRAVER
When I woke up, I took him in my arms. The blood had stopped coming out. [Beat] Five foot. .. eleven inches. That's how tall you were. I used to run my hand up and down your body like I was reading the bones.
REMZI
I wanted to travel every place on your body. Even the places you'd never been. Love can make you feel so changed you think the world is changed.
CRAVER
Up till then, we'd survived the war.
REMZI
[To CRAVER. Whispers] What are you?
FAIROUZ
[To CRAVER] What are you?
REMZI
[Louder] What are you, Craver?
CRAVER
[Whispers] What are you? What are you? [Shouts] What are you, Craver?
CRAVER
I am a white trash,
CRAVER 
Indian, sand nigger, brown trash, Arab, gook boy, faggot
CRAVER
[To FAIROUZ] from the banks of the Kentucky river.
FAIROUZ
He and I. We were never children. We were pieces of children. After that. But what is a piece of a child?
REMZI
Grass. Black pepper. Gold. From a gold crayon.
FAIROUZ
Sweetness doesn't last. Bitter lasts. Bile lasts. I am looking. Yes. I am looking for him.
REMZI
Pancake syrup. Lots of that.
FAIROUZ
And I don't want to find him. Not now. Not tomorrow. But I'm looking. [CRÄVER exits.] I don't want him to come back to me as him, but as a boy wearing my face. [Beat] Where you ended, I began.
REMZI
Ready, Fairouz? [Calls] Are you ready? [To himself] This one's just right. Won't sting.
FAIROUZ
And the sand. I can't sleep because of it. Everywhere. Inside my pillow. Inside my sleep. I'm walking. Walking and calling for you. But the sand slides below my feet, stopping me, keeping me in place. And the wind throwing handfuls. But then in the distance. I see. Something. Dark. Moving. Moving toward me.
REMZI
Eggshells. Mint.
FAIROUZ
And it seems hours, years, until I can see. What. Yes. That it's a child. Five or six. A boy. The wind has torn small pieces from your body. With each step you take toward me, you are less whole. When we reach each other, you are almost transparent.
REMZI
It's too dry. [Calls] Bring me some water.
FAIROUZ
Almost nothing left. I know I must say your name. Now. But I can't. There's no sand in my mouth. No wind. But I can't say it.
REMZI
[Calls] Are you coming?
FAIROUZ
I can't. Say it. And then you're moving away from me, moving back. I open my mouth. To say it. I say
REMZI
[Calls] Fairouz.
FAIROUZ
My own name. Not yours. And in that moment, the sun drills brilliant through your chest. And then you are. Gone.
FAIROUZ
The ram's horn. Why did he send me the ram's horn?
CRAVER
He carved your name on the inside. It took him three hours to do it. His sister would have appreciated it. You should have given it to her.
FAIROUZ
I am his sister.
GRAVER
Yes. You are. [He does a headstand.]
FAIROUZ
Why do you do that?
CRAVER
I'm training my balance.
FAIROUZ
Remzi had no balance.
GRAVER
No?
FAIROUZ
He said balance could be a bad thing, a trick to keep you in the middle, where things add up, where you can do no harm.
CRAVER
Remzi said that?
FAIROUZ
No. But he might have. [Beat] I'll go wherever I need to go. I won't leave them in peace.
CRAVER
Remzi said you were the best sister any brother—
FAIROUZ
[Interrupts him] Don't. Please. [Beat] It's terrible, isn't it? To be freed like this. [Beat] Are you going to talk?
CRAVER
I'm going to try.
FAIROUZ
But what is it for?
CRAVER
It might keep me alive. Talking about it might keep me alive.
FAIROUZ
I mean the ram's horn. What is it for?
CRAVER
He said.
REMZI
I want to race.
CRAVER
He said, If you blow on it, it will make a noise.
REMZI
I haven't had a good race in almost...
CRAVER
You're on! [Joins REMZI. Gets down in a starting position to run with him.] Motherfucker. Ready? [CRAVER is in two realities now and speaks to both REMZI and FAIROUZ with ease.]
FAIROUZ
A noise.
REMZI
I'm going to beat you this time!
FAIROUZ
Alright.
CRAVER
On your mark.
FAIROUZ
Will it be loud?
REMZI
I'm going to pass you by so fast, I'm going to "bang," disappear right in front of you!
CRAVER
[To FAIROUZ] Fucking loud. [To REMZI] Get set?
REMZI
You just watch me.
FAIROUZ
Fucking loud. I like that.
REMZI
Just watch me!
FAIROUZ
Goddamn, fucking loud!
CRAVER 
Go!
