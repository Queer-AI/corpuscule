JOANNE
I, Joanne.
ELISE
I, Elise.
ANN
I, Ann.
JOANNE
Do solemnly promise.
ELISE AND ANN
Do solemnly promise.
JOANNE
For as long as I know Elise and Ann.
ELISE
For as long as I know Joanne and Ann.
ANN
For as long as I know Joanne and Elise.
JOANNE
To abstain from all forms and varieties of sexual intercourse.
ELISE AND ANN
All forms and varieties of sexual intercourse.
JOANNE
To keep my body intact in order to register my protest against the way our society is run by men for men whose aim is the subjugation of the female and the enslavement of the working woman.
ELISE AND ANN
The working woman.
JOANNE
All forms of sex I therefore deny myself in order to work towards the establishment of a truly socialist society.
ANN
Oh, come on.
JOANNE
What?
ANN
I’ve come along with you so far, but … socialist society!
JOANNE
All right, you may dissent at this point but the essential commitment is made. All sex I deny.
ANN
Can we not drop the subject now once and for all?
ELISE
No one’s going to test our determination anyway.
JOANNE
Is there any coffee?
ANN
No. No one’s going to be much deprived.
ELISE
It’s not as if we ever saw men except parents, and it’s very unlikely we’ll ever see any more of those.
ANN
It wasn’t really that bad.
JOANNE
It was a disaster.
ANN
They were a little conscious of the lack of numbers. Who wouldn’t be? A chill in the air of Great Hall.
JOANNE
The singing of the Internationale should have warmed them up.
ANN
That was a singularly silly gesture on your part. Nobody knew the tune anyway. But your stupidity at least managed to unite them. We’ve been through the very worst that we can know, and now it’ll be time to rebuild.
JOANNE
When Robinson Crusoe landed on a desert island, his first instinct was to create a perfect embryo of the society he had escaped from.
ANN
Thank you, Joanne, but can we leave politics out of this? We will build a new sort of school where what people feel for people will be the basis of their relationships. No politics.
JOANNE
In Buñuel’s version – 1952, I think, anyway his Mexican period, the part of Robinson Crusoe was played by …
ELISE
Coast’s clear. They’ve gone.
JOANNE
The part of Crusoe was played by …
ELISE
For Christ’s sake shut up.
ANN
Let’s not talk like that.
JOANNE
You started it.
ANN
What’s the point?
JOANNE
She was getting at me.
ANN
Divided we fall.
ELISE
I’ve nearly finished another bootee. Its little feet are going to look so sweet.
ANN
Lovely.
JOANNE
All you need now is a fuck.
ELISE
I’m sitting here and often I stop and think perhaps I’ve seen my very last man.
ANN
Tradesmen.
ELISE
I mean real men. I can’t quite grasp what that means. Ann, Joanne, imagine it.
JOANNE
Tremendous.
ELISE
No more men.
JOANNE
The ideal.
ANN
We’re perfectly well used to it. I’ve been two years without now and I tell you I feel better.
ELISE
You don’t look any better.
ANN
I eat better.
ELISE
Repulsive.
ANN
I’ve taken off weight and I don’t have my skin trouble any longer.
JOANNE
Stop buggering about, you vile little child.
ANN
I don’t doubt, Elise, that men will some time reappear in your life.
JOANNE
That’s better.
ANN
And you will be happy. But until then we must spend the time creatively.
ELISE
Hurrah.
ANN
We will build a new Brackenhurst.
JOANNE
When Robinson Crusoe landed on a desert island his first instinct …
ANN
Well what would you do?
JOANNE
Do as you like. You’re in charge.
ANN
You find it so easy to criticize. What would you do?
JOANNE
I don’t know.
ANN
Really? Elise?
ELISE
What?
ANN
Do I have to do all the thinking?
ELISE
Mm.
JOANNE
Take that thing out of your mouth.
ANN
There’s no time to be lost.
JOANNE
Incidentally, I’m fed up with my room.
ANN
Your room will be seen to.
JOANNE
When I was a projectionist …
ELISE
We don’t want to know.
JOANNE
Do you know the last film I saw?
ELISE
Touch of Evil, Orson Welles, 1957.
JOANNE
Stupid to claim it’s a great film, but it does contain the most wonderful camera-work.
ELISE
The last film I saw was Look at Life.
ANN
I haven’t been for years.
ELISE
Called Loads on Roads.
JOANNE
That’s late ’68 Look at Life. Not a very great period at all. Very facile camera-work.
ELISE
I enjoyed it.
JOANNE
Crap.
ELISE
I thought it assured.
JOANNE
I thought it crap.
ELISE
I had a really good time.
JOANNE
What are you trying to get at?
ANN
And I never saw it.
ELISE
You’d have liked it, Ann.
JOANNE
What are you trying to prove?
ANN
Girls, my girls.
JOANNE
Oh yes.
JOANNE
Who’s teaching?
ELISE
I am.
ANN
Why aren’t you in there?
ELISE
I’ve given them reading. I put that bossy one in charge.
ANN
Is that a sign of a good schoolteacher?
ELISE
We’re appalling schoolteachers.
ANN
Come, come.
JOANNE
Are you going to teach?
ELISE
No.
JOANNE
I think I will, then.
ANN
I won’t have that said.
ELISE
Why have we only got eight pupils then?
ANN
Eleven paid.
ELISE
Eight stayed.
ANN
The eight are very happy.
ELISE
Freaks.
ANN
You’re as responsible as anyone.
ELISE
Agreed.
ANN
Though not as responsible as her.
ELISE
She’s not harming anyone.
ANN
She’s harming my girls. My beautiful girls. I’m sentimental perhaps but I do think girls should be spared her sort of nonsense.
ELISE
It does them good.
ANN
Stop expressing your opinions. They don’t help.
ELISE
Leave off.
ANN
You’re such a hopeless person. As a person. Don’t you wish anything for yourself?
ELISE
In the words of Isadora Duncan, I would like to be remembered as a great dancer but I fear I will only be remembered as a good bang.
ANN
It is chilly.
ELISE
Stop staring at me.
ANN
Window.
ELISE
Of course.
ANN
The parents were not impressed. What do you think of Joanne’s plans?
ELISE
Ridiculous.
ANN
She’s renamed her study the Women’s Liberation Workshop. She says she’s teaching dialectics this week instead of gym.
ELISE
You’ll have to fight back.
ANN
What do you think of my plans?
ELISE
Hopelessly naïve.
ANN
I like the idea of a new cricket pavilion.
ELISE
Hopeless optimism.
ANN
I’d like a new row of baths.
ELISE
Hopeless incompetence.
ANN
They’re currently filthy.
ELISE
The girls tell me they find it exciting to smoke cigarettes in their baths, the height of decadence.
ANN
I’d prefer you didn’t talk about the girls smoking in front of me.
ELISE
You know they smoke.
ANN
I do not know they smoke. I don’t know that at all. And if they do, Elise, I want it reported to me properly, not slipped into our conversation by subterfuge. I’m only trying my best, There are sixteen too many milk bottles coming every day. This has been going on for nine days. There are 144 spare bottles of milk in various shades of cheese.
ELISE
Joanne is domestic science.
ANN
Joanne is.
ELISE
She’s a constant reproach.
ANN
I’ve told her.
ELISE
I told her to love life. If you come to Brackenhurst unused, you are sure to be unused for life.
ANN
It’s not that bad. Fancy a game?
ELISE
Thank you, no.
ANN
Just because you always lose.
ELISE
I lose at all the games I play from ping-pong upwards and at Brackenhurst as there’s nothing else to do it makes for a very fine time.
ANN
I’ve seen it so often I can’t tell.
ELISE
I should have been a model. I would have shown clothes to advantage. I would have loved it. I should have been an actress.
ANN
Look, I think it’s all in, come and see.
ELISE
Where? It looks very nice.
ANN
It’s taken me four hours that. The children need colour to help them learn.
ELISE
Why don’t you get rid of Joanne?
ANN
I am responsible as much to my staff as to the children in my care. I have to think on everyone’s behalf.
JOANNE
I got bored. Your children are so stupid. I was reading Schopenhauer at 10 but this lot can’t manage an alphabet.
ANN
Who’s looking after them?
JOANNE
I left that bossy one in charge – Lucrecia Bourgeois as I call her. She’s loving it.
ANN
You’re the worst of the lot.
JOANNE
There’s a dog, incidentally, crapping on your tennis courts.
ELISE
Rubbish.
JOANNE
You changed the subject.
ELISE
I bet there’s nothing on the courts.
JOANNE
Flabby cow. The jerk. Go and look.
ELISE
Doesn’t bother me.
JOANNE
Flabby cow.
ELISE
Child.
JOANNE
Tit. Withered tit.
ELISE
Well?
ANN
There’s nothing there.
JOANNE
You’ve hardly looked.
ANN
I’ve looked enough.
JOANNE
The dog’s probably gone by now but I doubt if the crap will have fled.
ANN
I’ve looked once.
JOANNE
Take a proper look.
ANN
No.
JOANNE
Do you want to warp my development or something?
ANN
OK.
ELISE
What’s out there?
JOANNE
If she can’t see it, that’s her problem.
ELISE
Invention.
JOANNE
In a situation like this, anything is possible. The ascendant triumph of the mind. The battle pitched in heaven and in hell.
ELISE
You mean there’s nothing out there?
JOANNE
You must allow for things beyond your understanding.
ELISE
You mean there’s nothing out there.
JOANNE
The inner eye.
ELISE
You don’t impress me with these antics and you only lose the sympathy of Ann.
JOANNE
The revolutionary consciousness – my own – admits of no limitation to possible fields of vision. The world is infinite. As soon as anything may be said to have revolutionary essence, it may be said to exist.
ELISE
Do dogs’ stools have revolutionary essence?
JOANNE
The case of the dogshit is marginal and particular.
ANN
What is the point of all this? You send me hunting … I really don’t understand you.
JOANNE
There are things about you I dislike.
ANN
Let’s simply talk about it.
JOANNE
It’s there if you look for it.
ANN
I don’t know.
JOANNE
This is a woman’s world.
ELISE
Again!
ANN
Nothing to do with it.
JOANNE
I’m sick of you stamping about like a man gone wrong.
ELISE
So what?
JOANNE
If men reappear, if we ever see men again at Brackenhurst, they will have to be fey imitations of women to make any impact at all. Let me tell you this
JOANNE
No, really, listen. Brackenhurst inches the world forward. Brackenhurst is sexual purity. Brackenhurst is the community of women. Nothing is pointed, nothing perverts.
ELISE
She’s off her tiny tits.
ANN
Politics again. I’ve told you about politics.
JOANNE
I’m talking about women being women.
ELISE
There are some things a woman doesn’t talk about.
JOANNE
Yes?
ELISE
And her rights are one.
ANN
Her rights is one.
JOANNE
I’m talking about women being really women, being different from men.
ANN
When I edited my school magazine, we made the rule you could write about anything you wanted except sex, religion and politics. I’ve tried to stick to that rule in life.
JOANNE
And the dog’s crap?
ANN
The original point.
JOANNE
Yes.
ANN
Wasn’t there. You don’t have any respect at all.
JOANNE
It was there.
ANN
There are old-fashioned values and discipline is one.
JOANNE
Please look again.
ANN
If you people wash away the old-fashioned values, what happens to the old-fashioned people who happen to believe in them?
ELISE
You’re not old-fashioned.
ANN
There are people riding on the back of those values. You can’t shoot the horse away from under them.
ELISE
It doesn’t make sense.
JOANNE
I’ve long since lost track.
ANN
If I can’t discipline my staff into abandoning superficial left-wing feminist nonsense –
JOANNE
The point of the conversation …
ELISE
You don’t have any values.
JOANNE
I’m trying to get through to you.
ANN
You’re just using me.
JOANNE
Forget it.
ANN
It’s not there. I’ve combed the ground.
JOANNE
Thank you.
ELISE
How did we get into this conversation?
JOANNE
Forget it.
ANN
Feminist nonsense.
JOANNE
You’ve never listened, how do you know?
ANN
In three weeks the chairman of the Governors comes to inspect and we’re far from ready.
ELISE
We ought to have something special to show her.
ANN
Let’s paint the hall.
JOANNE
Are you determined to ignore me?
ANN
Oh, shut up.
JOANNE
I won’t be ignored.
ELISE
Does she know there are only eight pupils?
ANN
Everyone knows.
ELISE
Could we keep it from her? Does she know we’ve lost the Royal child?
ANN
Everyone knows.
JOANNE
It left a damn sight better off.
ANN
It hardly profited from the particular trick you taught it.
JOANNE
Everyone should know.
ANN
What you taught that child was not on the syllabus. It was not royal either.
JOANNE
Royal children are just the same as any others. They should know how to masturbate. It’s instinctive.
ANN
If it’s instinctive, you didn’t need to induce it.
JOANNE
I did not demonstrate, nor did I make any physical gesture of demonstration. I lent it some elementary literature.
ANN
Put about by your bloody feminists.
JOANNE
Masturbation is the only form of sexual expression left to the authentic woman.
ANN
I don’t see the value of the act.
JOANNE
There are three of us here. For five hundred, five thousand, five million years, the inferior sex, the sex used, used for their sex
ELISE
Brackenhurst has everything but men.
JOANNE
Exactly. Brackenhurst inches the world forward. Here at least is a pure ideal. No men.
ANN
There are no men here because they might savage the children. It’s nothing to do with sexual abstinence.
ELISE
I’m a normal sort of woman.
ANN
I want this to be a tight-knit community.
ELISE
I am normal.
JOANNE
This is the battle-ground of the future. From the start there were those who said marry, infiltrate, get in there, and a different crowd who argued – separate, the divorce is total. It’s between intercourse or isolation. I favour isolation. After black power, woman power.
ANN
Disorder!
ELISE
That bossy one can’t keep order.
ANN
All I care about is that you lost us our best pupil.
JOANNE
The child had asked to be taken away long before it wanked itself off.
ANN
Don’t be so vulgar.
JOANNE
I read the letter it wrote a week before it left. It said mummy the dormitory walls are wet and I want out of this hole.
ANN
Cruel. Really.
ELISE
She was peculiarly our own.
JOANNE
She paid the fees.
ANN
Her mother paid.
JOANNE
Her mother was a fool.
ANN
Her mother was a queen.
ELISE
Her father was a bit odd.
JOANNE
Her father was the queen. He’s the only one I admire in this whole rotten business.
ELISE
It was your fault.
JOANNE
I hate children anyway.
ELISE
They sense that.
JOANNE
They hate me.
ANN
They think you’re working class.
JOANNE
I am working class.
ELISE
Cheltenham’s only member of the working class.
JOANNE
It doesn’t mean I’m not.
ANN
No more politics. I’ve had enough.
ELISE
If you’re working class, I’m Brigitte Bardot.
JOANNE
We’re all in the same frig.
ELISE
And other platitudes.
JOANNE
Will you stop getting at me?
ELISE
I won’t let you rest until …
JOANNE
Ann, will you tell your assistant to shut up, I’m taking to drink.
ANN
Elise, shut up –
ELISE
Don’t do what she says.
JOANNE
Have you checked recently for the revolutionary turd?
ANN
Of course I have.
JOANNE
Then now I’d like you to look for that leak on the roof.
ELISE
You don’t know there’s anything there.
JOANNE
If my bedroom walls are wet, it’s a good bet to hunt on the roof for the reason.
ANN
You should refer it to the Building Maintenance Committee.
JOANNE
We are the committee.
ELISE
We’re not in session.
JOANNE
I’m for your going up.
ELISE
I’m against it.
ANN
I’m chairman.
JOANNE
Which means you have to vote for. Chairman always does.
ANN
Very well, I see I shall have to go, but if this is another of your damnfool tricks …
ELISE
She’s having you on.
JOANNE
I would never …
ANN
Getting me up on the roof.
JOANNE
Up, up and to the roo-oof.
ELISE
It’s undemocratic.
ANN
I’ll do it to keep the peace. I’ll do anything to make you happy.
ELISE
You’ve no right to upset her.
JOANNE
Let her face facts.
ELISE
Women’s Liberation Workshop!
JOANNE
She’s spent her whole life pretending she’s a man. Deserves what’s coming to her.
ELISE
She’s just a dear, sweet middle-class girl. Like us all.
JOANNE
No such thing as middle class. In a capitalist economy, there are only two functions – labour and the organization of labour. People often refer to something called a middle class which suffers mythically from a middle-class morality but there’s no such thing. There’s the controllers and the controlled.
ELISE
You don’t believe that.
JOANNE
I do.
ELISE
And which category do Cheltenham girls fit into?
JOANNE
That’s nothing to do with it. All women are controlled. It’s no longer a matter of birth. There’s a new system of privilege based on intelligence – or rather a certain sort of acquisitive masculine intelligence that would bend in any direction to smother alternatives. In this society where an active, probing, hopeful intelligence is the sign of being a good bloke, women are valued for one thing – their reproductive facility. They bang like shithouse doors. The alternative society that we create may be black or it may be crippled or it may, let’s hope, be female – but it is an alternative. There’ll be no moral judgements, or processes of consultation, or export drives, or balance of payments. There is independence of mind and body. The alternative cannot be defined.
ELISE
Why not?
JOANNE
By escaping definition it escapes parody and defeat. Brackenhurst is the first real experiment in all-female living.
ELISE
And this is it? This is it?
JOANNE
Yes.
ELISE
This is all-female living? This is the revolution?
JOANNE
Yes.
ELISE
What we’ve got now?
JOANNE
Yes.
ELISE
I’d rather not.
JOANNE
It’s only in embryo. We’ve scarcely begun. I anticipate communal female living on a massive scale – independence of thought among teachers and pupils. I’ve already begun. I’ve told the children that you and Ann haven’t yet grasped the concept. I teach them to despise Ann because she wants to make Brackenhurst like other societies.
ELISE
What about me?
JOANNE
I tell them you’re immature because you still want to give your cunt to capitalism.
ELISE
I’ve never thought of it that way.
JOANNE
Do.
ELISE
I never could. Men are just men to men and there it is.
JOANNE
Leave her.
ELISE
She’s fallen off the roof.
JOANNE
Don’t help her, for God’s sake, we want a crisis.
ELISE
Let go of me.
JOANNE
Any intermediate action that serves to reinforce the status quo rather than to restructure the whole system must by very definition be wrong.
ELISE
Get fucking off me.
JOANNE
The present situation must be allowed to develop to a crisis point in order to emphasize to all the needs for the complete overall destruction of the present scheme of things. Let her lie there a bit.
ELISE
Fucking maniac.
JOANNE
Liberty! Equality! Sisterhood!
ELISE
Are you all right?
ANN
Slight fall. Nothing at all.
ELISE
Let me get you a drink.
ANN
Please don’t bother.
ELISE
You could have been hurt.
ANN
I’m pretty tough. I’ll go back up.
ELISE
You can’t go up now.
ANN
Why not?
ELISE
You’ve just had a fall.
JOANNE
Finish the job.
ANN
I’ll find out what’s up there.
JOANNE
Did you find anything?
ELISE
You can’t go up again right after falling down. It’s very dangerous.
ANN
Nonsense.
ELISE
You can’t possibly go back.
ANN
I promise you it’s OK.
ELISE
I forbid you.
ANN
Elise.
ELISE
There’s nothing wrong with the pipe. Stay where you are.
ANN
Really, I can’t deal with both your tempers.
ELISE
What are you going up for? Her?
ANN
I said I’d have a look.
ELISE
Her bedroom walls are perfectly dry. I’ve felt them. Do you know what she’s just told me? Do you know what she tells the children?
ANN
I can imagine.
ELISE
I wouldn’t repeat the things she says about us.
ANN
She’s free to say what she likes. She’s a member of my staff.
JOANNE
Are you going up on the roof or not?
ANN
Of course.
JOANNE
You’d better go up before it’s dark.
ELISE
Don’t you dare.
ANN
What?
ELISE
I suppose you believe this stuff about how she’s miserable at night.
ANN
I’d do the same for you.
ELISE
Kiss my foot.
ANN
Huh.
JOANNE
Let’s get on. It must be lovely on the roof.
ANN
I’m bound to protect her.
ELISE
I accept that, Ann, and will you lick my big toe?
ANN
Don’t be so silly. Ha ha.
ELISE
Cut my toenails with your teeth.
ANN
Don’t be so silly.
ELISE
Cut my toes.
ANN
Please let’s be friends.
ELISE
Toes.
JOANNE
Isn’t that sunset beautiful?
ELISE
Put my toes in your mouth.
ANN
Out of sheer embarrassment.
ELISE
Go on.
ANN
You don’t …
ELISE
Go on.
JOANNE
Isn’t that the most beautiful sunset?
ANN
Come.
ELISE
Ann.
ANN
Elise.
ELISE
Do what you say.
JOANNE
A girl could almost be happy.
ELISE
Now lick.
ANN
Come.
ELISE
Lick my toes.
JOANNE
Absurd. Ludicrous. Are we meant to take that seriously?
ANN
That was nothing.
JOANNE
Why can’t people think of anything else when they think of women?
ANN
That proved nothing.
JOANNE
They think of sex.
ANN
It doesn’t mean anything, Elise. It’s quite without significance.
ELISE
Now do it again but with more tact.
JOANNE
Lick a toe with tact.
ELISE
Again.
JOANNE
How can you lick a toe with tact?
ELISE
Don’t be difficult.
ANN
Tact isn’t in it.
ELISE
Don’t be difficult.
ANN
Absolutely.
JOANNE
Fucking ridiculous.
ANN
It just felt good.
JOANNE
Get it yourself.
ANN
I take it from you now, Joanne, but I’m hard put to take it when the girls are around.
JOANNE
Some kind of imaginative gleam in me upsets you.
ANN
I have some status here.
JOANNE
You know I’m an artist.
ANN
I know.
JOANNE
Not the kind of artist that actually has anything to do with art. I wouldn’t touch it eeurch. Culture eeurch. But an artist in the way I am. I want gold cherubs blowing trumpets over my bed and an ivory bathtub to wash in.
ANN
Anything.
JOANNE
Not dripping polystyrene.
ANN
It’s tiled over to keep it warm.
JOANNE
It gives me hay fever. I trip daily over those stringy raffia mats on the slippery path to the bathroom, where the basin is slimy with a coat of old toothpaste, other people’s spittings of toothpaste and saliva. In this state I fall downstairs to teach eight benighted little sods what – you change the time-table so often I’m doing woodwork when I should be teaching chemistry. I want out of it, my love.
ANN
There’s nothing I can do.
JOANNE
I’m determined to leave.
ANN
Of course.
JOANNE
Here at Brackenhurst, a distinctive sound. The heavy breathing that means nothing is happening. At Brackenhurst nothing ever happens. The tedium is quite a challenge, quite an experience. The distinctive English sight of nothing happening and nothing going to happen.
ANN
Nothing ever happens at Brackenhurst.
JOANNE
What was the point of that game with the toes?
ANN
That was Elise’s idea.
JOANNE
Ah.
ANN
Elise is teaching again. She has the knack of making them happy. She’s a superior teacher. When the Governors come, I’ll expect you to behave. I’ll expect you to be a positive person.
JOANNE
You’re poisoning me.
ANN
I’m quite without malice.
JOANNE
I’ve had stomach cramps all week. There’s poison in my food.
ANN
You must complain to the kitchens.
JOANNE
You are the kitchens.
ANN
You’re a child and you’re lucky to be here, and it’s only because Elise and I love you and look after you that you are able to face life at all, and it’s only because we want you to be happy that we protect you. You’re a parasite and depend on us, and every night I pray for you, and I’d maybe like you to be somewhat grateful.
JOANNE
My arse.
ANN
You’re a schizophrenic, Joanne.
JOANNE
Cow, flabby cow.
ANN
The doctor said you ought to be told.
JOANNE
Sodden flabby cow.
ANN
I’m tired of having to love you.
JOANNE
I’m sick of your motherly concern.
ANN
Schizophrenic garbage.
JOANNE
Cow.
ANN
Very good.
ELISE
Good.
ANN
Very good.
ELISE
Shot.
ANN
She’s got a lovely cover drive.
ELISE
Shot.
ANN
Don’t let her catch you. Run, for God’s sake, run.
ELISE
She’s all right.
ANN
She will not play off her back foot. She will not move on to it.
ELISE
I’ve told her often enough.
ANN
I’ve told her again and again.
ELISE
The visitors are good. They’re undeniably good.
ANN
Doesn’t it make you glad to be alive? What is it Wordsworth says?
ELISE
Dunno.
ANN
Ah.
JOANNE
God, it’s hot.
ANN
It’s hot or it’s cold, you always complain.
JOANNE
It’s a man’s game anyway, it’s quite wrong for women to play it at all.
ANN
They’re not a match for our first eleven.
JOANNE
What eleven? There are only eight.
ANN
Seven. Another dropped out this morning. The chauffeur came to remove her.
ELISE
I can’t see why we’re so bad at this business.
ANN
We’re not bad.
ELISE
I know I’m not very clever and, Joanne, you’re controversial, Ann, you’re a little scaring to the young, but we’re no worse than most.
ANN
D’you think Benenden has this trouble?
ELISE
They seem to hold on to their pupils.
ANN
You think we’re doing something wrong?
ELISE
There seems to be something missing. The schizophrenic’s got my chair.
JOANNE
It’s mine.
ELISE
We’re rather short on facilities.
ANN
Oh well done. What a good shot. That was good. I still say a pavilion. That’s where we fall down. Everyone should get a prize on Sports Day – things like that. Class tells.
ELISE
Men in the dormitories.
ANN
Elise.
ELISE
I am pornography.
ANN
I am cricket.
JOANNE
I want to go and see a film. Take your filthy seat.
ANN
The bus went hours ago and there’s not one back today.
JOANNE
I’ll go tomorrow.
ANN
No bus tomorrow because it’s Thursday.
JOANNE
I’m walking tomorrow.
ANN
It’s eighteen miles.
JOANNE
I’ll cycle.
ANN
The tyres are flat.
JOANNE
I want to see a fucking film.
ANN
Don’t swear.
ELISE
Shot.
JOANNE
I’m sick of looking at things live. I want to see them second hand.
ANN
When D. H. Lawrence went to the cinema for the first time he found it so – vulgar – he vomited.
JOANNE
You mean old snipcock.
ELISE
Joanne.
ANN
Lawrence was the most wonderful man of our age.
JOANNE
Lawrence never got over his amazement that the bits slotted together.
ANN
Lawrence loved truth and beauty. Stop this filthy talk. Stupid girl has run herself out.
ELISE
Well played.
ANN
Good innings.
ELISE
Well done.
ANN
Very good.
ELISE
How ugly she is.
JOANNE
She can’t help that.
ELISE
Never said she could.
JOANNE
Why pick on me all the time?
ANN
Now.
ELISE
There.
ANN
That one?
ELISE
It’ll do what’s required. I prepared it.
ANN
It’s hardly fair to her.
ELISE
Don’t weaken now.
ANN
Excellent. I have very high hopes of this joke.
ELISE
This is awfully good fun.
ANN
Who is in now?
ELISE
I hate her.
ANN
She’s not much.
JOANNE
I said well done to that girl and she said that was no compliment coming from me as I hate cricket.
ELISE
True.
JOANNE
I get easily upset.
ELISE
Hurrah, hurrah.
ANN
She fell right into it.
JOANNE
What imagination.
ELISE
Don’t be sarky. You fell right into it.
JOANNE
Imaginative.
ELISE
Don’t try and get out of it. You fell for it.
JOANNE
I’m suffering, damn you.
ANN
Don’t take it so seriously.
ELISE
Have a little fun.
JOANNE
Doesn’t anyone realize how much I suffer?
ANN
We can see.
ELISE
So can the whole school. All seven.
JOANNE
You will not take me seriously.
ELISE
No.
JOANNE
Isn’t there a time to stop joking and –
ELISE
No.
JOANNE
You shun me, the girls shun me.
ANN
You’re making a ridiculous exhibition of yourself. Shut up and sit down.
JOANNE
What have you got against me?
ELISE
Relax.
ANN
You think we persecute you.
JOANNE
You poison my food.
ANN
You think everyone hates you.
JOANNE
It’s a pathetically ineffective way of poisoning anyone to put arsenic in their food, because it starts coming out in their hair. Look.
ELISE
Dandruff.
JOANNE
Arsenic.
ANN
We love you.
JOANNE
You collapse my deckchair.
ELISE
Joke.
JOANNE
It’s not just you, it’s the girls.
ANN
You think everyone is against you.
JOANNE
Let me make myself clear. I didn’t come here to be liked. I came for different reasons and it wasn’t to entertain you or fartarse on your behalf. I was wrong to be sidetracked. I’m tough as leather as the children say – they hate me. OK. What I set out to do was educate this mob to be themselves. I’m here to teach isolation so I resent the fact I have to mix with you at all. I want every child to know that it’s a girl and different for being a girl and better for being a girl. I want a separate culture. I want a different way of life. We’re too far gone to want anything but everything – all the way out. I want a self-sufficient child. I want an alternative to everything men are. I left everything I loved, I haven’t been to the cinema for I don’t know how long, to come to Brackenhurst, to work in a community that was feminine by necessity and make it feminine by choice. You should want to be women. And I found – what did I find – Elise whose idea of the sexual revolution is to open her legs and say AAAAAH and Ann – what can I say? And a combined ability that keeps a tenuous grasp on just seven children. I’ll teach them all they need and I don’t care if you hate me for it.
ELISE
It’s gone right past square leg.
ANN
Oh well hit.
ELISE
And you teach them – sleight of hand.
ANN
Not that incident again.
ELISE
You teach them dexterity with the Mum rollette.
JOANNE
What a squalid mind you have.
ANN
Let me tell you something, Joanne, that I ought to have told you a long time ago.
JOANNE
What’s that?
ANN
No, I can’t be bothered.
JOANNE
You have nothing to tell me.
ANN
I’m putting you in charge of the School Corps.
JOANNE
Over my dead body.
ANN
If necessary. I’m appointing you Sergeant Major. It’s a position of some responsibility. At Brackenhurst we control the minds of the young. We have the influence to shape their lives. I have listened to you for some time now, Joanne. I’ve heard your views on power, responsibility, education, the British Press, constitutional monarchy, the race to the moon, the emancipation of women, Lord Thomson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, cricket, dancing, smoking and masturbation and I’m glad having listened to judge your opinions pure balls and your mind irretrievably shallow.
ELISE
That’s strongly put.
ANN
I’m so tired of the political mind.
JOANNE
Where’s the gap in this bloody thing?
ANN
Come back here.
JOANNE
I’m getting out.
ANN
Karate specialist, you see. Simple skill worth knowing.
JOANNE
You hurt me.
ANN
Everyone tries a breakout at one time or another.
ELISE
The third mistress always tries.
JOANNE
You’ve let them go before.
ANN
The mistresses, not the girls.
ELISE
The girls are easier to catch.
ANN
One girl reached the village but the uniform gave her away.
ELISE
I thought this was meant to be the ideal community.
JOANNE
If we are to be grouped together for some social purpose …
ELISE
Social theory.
JOANNE
But this is a repressive …
ANN
You are hardly likely to get any farther than anyone before you.
JOANNE
Masculine …
ELISE
Not on those legs!
JOANNE
Does no one listen to anything I say?
ELISE
No.
JOANNE
I feel victimized.
ANN
This school …
JOANNE
Don’t bother to go on.
ANN
This school …
JOANNE
Don’t bother to go on.
ANN
This school …
JOANNE
I don’t want to hear. We don’t want to hear.
ANN
This school …
JOANNE
Don’t finish that sentence.
ANN
This school …
JOANNE
I won’t let you.
ANN
This school …
JOANNE
You’re not to.
ANN
This school …
JOANNE
I think that sums up things pretty well. From now on war.
ANN
Education should be lethal. I think of teaching as a knife.
JOANNE
Vicious.
ANN
We must be very careful what they hear and see. The sight of you, Joanne, is therapeutic. They thank God they’re not like you.
ELISE
It’s true.
ANN
I use you in my social adaptability classes. Some of the girls have very advanced theories about you.
JOANNE
Such as.
ANN
I use you as an example of the modern woman.
JOANNE
What about her?
ELISE
Me?
JOANNE
Permissiveness.
ELISE
I wish it was.
JOANNE
Debauchery, love of body. Isn’t she in your classes?
ANN
Elise is the Assistant Headmistress.
JOANNE
That’s not what it says on the lavatory wall.
ANN
It is really of no consequence. You and I know that, Joanne. We are above such things. I look at Elise.
ELISE
Don’t bother with me.
ANN
And pity that pathetic dependence on the body.
JOANNE
Pathetic.
ELISE
I’m just backward.
ANN
You shudder she’s so retarded.
ELISE
I’m just backward, I like cricket and sex.
ANN
Cricket, my God.
ELISE
Shot.
ANN
Very good.
JOANNE
Nothing has changed.
ELISE
Excellent.
ANN
Excellent. Doesn’t it make you glad to be alive? After all your bickering and complaint? It’s criminal not to enjoy yourself. I’m so sorry for you, my love.
JOANNE
Forget it.
ANN
But I must ask you to do your duty now. That dreadful woman is signalling which means you must go out and umpire.
JOANNE
I hate it.
ANN
It’s your turn.
JOANNE
I make all the wrong decisions. Everyone gets so angry with me.
ANN
Quite right. It makes for a game of chance. Better by far for the character.
ELISE
I’m always fair.
ANN
I always try to throw in some errors of judgement to spite all those frightful girls who are all skill and no charm.
ELISE
They think it’s favouritism.
ANN
I’ll do your umpiring for you, Joanne, if you’ll do my shower duty in return.
JOANNE
Thank you.
JOANNE
All right, tell me now.
ELISE
Do you really want to know?
JOANNE
She trusts you, doesn’t she?
ELISE
She believes I love Brackenhurst.
JOANNE
It’s all a bit improbable.
ELISE
I don’t know the details but I can tell you this much. There are no men at Brackenhurst.
JOANNE
Tradesmen.
ELISE
Let’s not get political. Tradesmen aren’t real men. Who comes here? A few corn and meat merchants, hardly virile, hardly material for Ann. But … she is definitely having an affair with the butcher.
JOANNE
The butcher!
ELISE
She says he has capable hands. I’d call them murderous. Real butcher’s hands with black hairs on the finger joints – they attract her.
JOANNE
How disgusting it all is.
ELISE
She thinks of him a lot. He’s called Haskins.
JOANNE
There’s an alliance, a union?
ELISE
Of course.
JOANNE
Intercourse on some, on several occasions?
ELISE
Of course.
JOANNE
The pig.
ELISE
Ann told me he was an energetic man.
JOANNE
Things are definitely happening.
ELISE
Oh yes.
JOANNE
I knew that it would all come out.
ELISE
She’s a woman of character.
JOANNE
I can see her across the field. Look, look. Everything other people would have wanted her to be. I daren’t be too rude for fear you won’t like me.
ELISE
It’s all too far gone for that.
JOANNE
I feel silly.
ELISE
It’s never stopped you before.
JOANNE
You don’t like me anyway.
ELISE
I do.
JOANNE
She’s capable, lovable, would even be a good mother to a child. She’s a fool because she wants to be, like so many old people.
ELISE
She’s 32.
JOANNE
She’s old. Why do they all choose to be like that? The trouble with Ann –
ELISE
Tell me the trouble with Ann.
JOANNE
The trouble with Ann –
ELISE
The trouble with Ann is the trouble with most people. Her life stopped at the age of 18.
JOANNE
Hard to say. I think Ann called a no-ball some time after one of our lot was caught.
ELISE
Typical decision.
JOANNE
We must never accept things, never give in.
ELISE
What use is Ann to you?
JOANNE
No use. What’s the time?
ELISE
Tea time.
JOANNE
I haven’t worked everything out yet. You must remember I have survived an English education. To have any plan of action at the end of an English education is a triumph.
ELISE
But you don’t have a plan for Ann?
JOANNE
Brackenhurst is a pure ideal, pure idealism. I had a dream last night. It concerned you. Would you like to hear it?
ELISE
No.
JOANNE
I’ll tell you.
ELISE
I should think it was a ballet dancer in flames or a snake in a custard pie.
JOANNE
Not quite. This was the dream. You were about to have a child, and the rest of us – there were a lot of us – gathered round a table and waited for you to give birth. You were not much inflated, simply we knew you were pregnant. You didn’t look it. We knew it in the way you can be sure in dreams. You suddenly asked to be excused, to slip out for a few moments, but I protested. I took an active part because I felt involved which is unusual. I felt so strongly, not towards you, but about you. I wanted to see you have the child. You lay down on the table and the first animal came out. There was some discussion among us as to who should have the first bite, but a man interrupted and ate your first child which was a chicken. The second was a fish and I had some. You lay on the table and the wet animals came regularly from you. And we all ate.
ELISE
You really are a fraud.
JOANNE
It’s true.
ELISE
You muck around stamping about in our lives.
JOANNE
I’m just trying to help.
ELISE
Listen, help yourself.
JOANNE
How?
ELISE
Ann’s changed. She’s gone weak in the heart from knowing Haskins … He’s your man.
JOANNE
I want to get at her somehow.
ELISE
Use the butcher.
JOANNE
Yes.
ELISE
The butcher’s knife. Look, they’re coming in.
JOANNE
It looks like Accident. Joseph Losey, 1967. The great Dirk Bogarde.
ELISE
In for tea.
JOANNE
They look so fucking happy.
ELISE
Rah! Rah!
ANN
Smashing game.
JOANNE
A bucket just fell on my head.
ELISE
No sense of humour.
JOANNE
Tit.
ELISE
I didn’t do it.
JOANNE
Bloody Ann did it. They’re out to get me. Last night the chandelier that’s over my bed crashed down as I was getting in. It’s getting so I daren’t move.
ELISE
It’s all in your imagination.
JOANNE
It was a vow we all took, remember? And it was inherent in the vow that we’d all love each other a little more.
ELISE
It wasn’t specified.
JOANNE
And we will stick to that?
ELISE
Yes.
JOANNE
And there will be a little more – love.
ELISE
Give me a hand.
JOANNE
I’ve a yoyo here I want to mend.
ELISE
Eh, lass.
JOANNE
It’s not running properly.
ELISE
Thou wer’t born idle and thou shal’t cum to nowt.
JOANNE
That’s very good.
ELISE
It should be. I was born there.
JOANNE
You come from the North?
ELISE
Of course.
JOANNE
I never knew. Was your father a miner?
ELISE
No.
JOANNE
Not the other side, not a millowner?
ELISE
Of course not.
JOANNE
And you were poor?
ELISE
Very.
JOANNE
And did you eat chip butties and go to chapel?
ELISE
Incessantly.
JOANNE
Oh, Elise I never guessed you were working class. Why’s your name Elise?
ELISE
They mis-spelt Elsie on the birth certificate.
JOANNE
And when you were young was it all day trips to Bingley and Huddersfield and Salford and Leeds? Is that how it really was? I see it so clearly. Did your parents fuck loudly in upstairs rooms?
ELISE
The only person who fucked was my sister. She married early and they came to live with us in the room next door to me. And at nights before I really knew what was happening, she used to cry out suddenly when she reached her orgasm – ‘Eh, by gum.’
JOANNE
How splendid!
ELISE
It was wonderful. I used to lie there and imagine what it would be like to have a real vaginal orgasm.
JOANNE
No such thing.
ELISE
There is.
JOANNE
Isn’t.
ELISE
Is.
JOANNE
All orgasms are the same in the female. The idea that there are two kinds has been put about by oppressive males determined to deny women their rightful clitoral pleasures.
ELISE
Nonsense.
JOANNE
It’s true. Men have consistently attempted to downgrade the clitoris. They claim it is just a withered penis. What arrogance! A withered penis! The clitoris has been scientifically established as having the greatest concentration of sensory nerve endings of any part of a human body, male or female. More than this.
ELISE
There’s more?
JOANNE
It has also, inch for inch, measure for measure, a far greater erectile capacity than the comparatively dull, insensitive, numb male organ.
ELISE
Is that really true?
JOANNE
The satisfaction of the female is correspondingly greater than that of the male. The penis is a poor blunt instrument beside the sensitivity of the delicate amazing clitoris.
ELISE
Are you a virgin?
JOANNE
Of course.
ELISE
Then you don’t know what you’re talking about.
JOANNE
You don’t have to have felt a penis to know these things. You can make your mind up perfectly adequately from descriptions and drawings.
ELISE
Help me clean the baths.
JOANNE
No.
ELISE
There’s an inspection in half an hour. As soon as the Greek dancing’s over. And I’ve got my song to rehearse.
JOANNE
Now give us a song!
ELISE
Do you want to see?
JOANNE
Please.
ELISE
For the Governors of Brackenhurst a song, in the modern idiom.
JOANNE
Come on.
ELISE
Give us a chance.
JOANNE
Dreadful.
ELISE
Why?
JOANNE
What does it mean? It doesn’t mean anything.
ELISE
I’ve always wanted to entertain. I’m going to try showbiz when I get out.
JOANNE
Is it easy to do that walk?
ELISE
Nothing simpler.
JOANNE
I’m coming along.
ELISE
Very good.
JOANNE
‘I’m Singing In The Rain’. Gene Kelly. 1951. I never thought to have any talent. Look, I’ll show you how to do the Gene Kelly.
ELISE
I’ve got work to do.
JOANNE
Let someone else do the work.
ELISE
Give me that. I’ve got to do it.
JOANNE
Why?
ELISE
Ann told me to.
JOANNE
So?
ELISE
I’ll report you.
JOANNE
What do you think you’re doing, Elise, obeying her?
ELISE
Give me the brush.
JOANNE
Use your claws. And counting your shares? You see, I’ve found out about the shares in Shell Oil and ICI and Marks and Spencer and –
ELISE
Good shares!
JOANNE
Class traitor – a working-class girl with shares in Dow Chemicals. A very good share the napalm share as long as the war holds. Supply and demand – very much a seller’s market nowadays in napalm.
ELISE
I’m putting it aside for my old age.
JOANNE
Quite so.
ELISE
You’ve been hunting through my papers.
JOANNE
I’m fascinated by your private life. I find it studded with young bucks.
ELISE
You have read everything in my room.
JOANNE
Everything. If we’re to live together, make this community work, then we must know everything about each other, so we’re strong in each other.
ELISE
Not much strength in my things.
JOANNE
I don’t know.
ELISE
Quite the opposite. I don’t like you hunting about, trying to make me political.
JOANNE
Make you? We’re all political. We’re in politics up to our eyeballs, in the shit, God help us.
ELISE
What’s that for? Help me scrub.
JOANNE
No.
ELISE
Ann’ll see to you. Wait till I tell her. What is that for?
JOANNE
It’s for Ann to clean. Principles of guerrilla warfare. I am fighting back where least expected.
ANN
Did you grease the bottoms of the Greek dancers’ shoes?
ELISE
Did she do that?
JOANNE
Not saying.
ANN
They’re falling about like skittles in there. I’m going to have a word or two to say. Free form and bodily expression it’s meant to be, and you’ve got them tumbling about showing their knickers in front of the Governors. Clean up that mess on the floor, Joanne. If you won’t help, then you’ll have to go.
JOANNE
Suits me.
ANN
Are these chairs not done, Elise, mercy, and the Governors not five minutes away?
JOANNE
From where I’m standing I can see the butcher calling at the door. He’s knocked twice and looks like giving up.
ANN
I’ll go down and speak to him.
JOANNE
I think it’s a delivery, I’ll see to it.
ANN
Please, I can manage.
JOANNE
I am Domestic Science, I can go.
ANN
I am Kitchens, I will.
JOANNE
The Governors are waiting for you in the Hall.
ANN
Out of my way.
JOANNE
Let me.
ANN
Quick or he’ll go.
JOANNE
Exactly. Back to the Greek dancing.
ANN
I want to see the butcher.
JOANNE
There’s nothing between his legs you couldn’t find elsewhere.
ANN
Vulgar. Heartless child.
JOANNE
So?
ANN
You’re fired.
JOANNE
If a lascivious and debauched headmistress can’t even …
ELISE
What about our community?
JOANNE
The mistake of any doctrinal group is to render itself monolithic. In other words, intercourse or isolation? I’m leaving. I must take my practical experience of a feminist community – Brackenhurst – to my sisters in the outside world. Who can benefit from what I learnt here.
ELISE
She won’t let you go.
JOANNE
To show women everywhere they don’t have to lie down for anyone.
ELISE
You haven’t done anything here. You haven’t gone one inch towards helping any woman here.
JOANNE
I’ve got that woman on the run. This place’ll never give off that dreadful masculine chill again. Look, she’s chasing the butcher down the drive.
ELISE
You’ve closed the whole place down.
JOANNE
Well, that’s good, isn’t it? Are you going to run that bath all day? Dawn. An empty street. A delicatessen. Goldstein’s delicatessen. A scrap of paper blowing down the cardboard street. A streetlight still lit. Two boys dressed in something like tweed and urchin caps, sly as hell with shining faces. A brick, a window, they throw it through, hands into the cooked meat counter but the alarm’s gone and we’re on our way into another Warner Brothers Retrospective season.
ANN
You know I don’t mind about all the troubles, Joanne, that have set you aside from the rest of us, your being an artist and therefore different. But the point must be made. You live in a world of your own, and you must control your fantasies.
JOANNE
You sacked me.
ANN
That remains to be seen.
JOANNE
I’m dismissed, I promise you.
ANN
We need you far too much.
ELISE
Far too much.
ANN
There’s no need for that now, Elise. The Governors have gone.
ELISE
What about my song?
ANN
Keep it for another time.
ELISE
My song.
ANN
There are very few Governors left. A few more Governors than pupils in fact, but not very many all the same.
JOANNE
Let me go. There are only five pupils. You don’t need three teachers.
ANN
Where would you go?
JOANNE
I’d work in the cinema again.
ANN
You couldn’t cope, it’s become terribly hard work. They have seventy-millimetre equipment. That’s man’s work.
JOANNE
There’s no ready reason …
ANN
You’re as much sold on this place as the rest of us. Isn’t she, Elise?
ELISE
Yes.
JOANNE
Why do you want me to stay?
ANN
Because we love you.
JOANNE
Why do you love me?
ANN
Because you’re you. You’re my testament to Brackenhurst, I remember the Princess said to me –
JOANNE
Snob.
ANN
The Princess said – ‘Why employ somebody with such a feeble grasp of reality?’ She meant you. ‘Your Highness,’ I replied, ‘here we care.’ And her Highness answered and I was very moved by this, ‘Perhaps in the kingdom of the mind the sane are mad and the mad sane.’ Such a way she said it. And they say royalty aren’t intellectuals. They aren’t in the way you are, Joanne
JOANNE
She still took her kid away.
ANN
You drive everyone away. The Governors fled so fast you might have thought the house was on fire. Your feminist appeals strike no chord in women and simply repel men.
JOANNE
Good. It was a real disappointment to me when you gave in. Chastity was something of a passion of mine. To have held off for so long, Ann, and then to give in to the butcher – a fine man, a working man, an artisan, certainly. But not the man you deserve, through no fault of his own a victim, poor sod, one of the sodding people.
ANN
I’m a cumbersome performer. I don’t count myself very much. I haven’t laid bare great golden fields of happiness I’d care to tell you about. I don’t have simple sexual needs. No one who teaches at Brackenhurst does. We’re all in the Freud and underpant class. The men I’ve known leave soon afterwards. But my experience of men is what makes me a woman.
JOANNE
How grotesque.
ANN
Grotesque it may be to you whose experience of sex is the Brackenhurst changing-rooms in among the brassières, but to those of us –
ELISE
Do keep it down –
ANN
You’re on my side.
JOANNE
All my suffering! I shall crop my hair like Joan of Arc. Dreyer 1926.
ANN
While you’re there, Joanne, listen.
JOANNE
I don’t believe it.
ANN
Can you hear me?
JOANNE
It’s not.
ANN
I will fight to the death for my right to be inferior. Inferiority is a privilege I wish to preserve. I don’t want to be equal. And I don’t want my girls equal. And I don’t want a socialist community.
JOANNE
Now it comes out.
ANN
See what I want? See what I want?
ELISE
Leave her alone.
ANN
I’m losing my pupils, my Governors, my school, my self-respect.
ELISE
Leave her alone. Let’s go for a drink.
ANN
Yesterday she handed all the girls a jar of Vaseline.
JOANNE
Very good, excellent.
ANN
Drink?
ELISE
You can take me out tonight.
ANN
Thank you.
ELISE
Don’t be shy.
ANN
What would you like?
ELISE
Scotch.
ANN
Go mad and have a Campari.
ELISE
I’ll have a Scotch.
ANN
My first …
ELISE
What? Go on, say.
ANN
Lovely dress.
ELISE
Thank you.
ANN
Lovely.
ELISE
Huh huh.
ANN
You’ve got the figure for it, too. So slim.
ELISE
Flat-chested. I’ve always had small breasts.
ANN
I didn’t imagine they’d shrunk.
ELISE
It doesn’t convince me for a moment. I feel exceedingly foolish. I’d never laugh at a joke like that.
ANN
I was perfectly well in there.
ELISE
It’s not a bit realistic.
ANN
I wish I had your breasts.
ELISE
You’re welcome to them.
ANN
I don’t know what it is people like about big breasts.
ELISE
Don’t be absurd. Absurd. If you ever talked like – a man would fly if you said that.
ANN
Who’s the man?
ELISE
You are.
ANN
So?
ELISE
So …
ANN
I make the rules.
ELISE
You can’t have it both ways. Are you a man?
ANN
I’m the bloody man.
ELISE
Then no breasts. Breasts are out. You may comment on mine but you may not refer to your own.
ANN
I knew when I first met you that here was someone very warm, very responsive, who would understand the troubles – in my life immediately.
ELISE
A great improvement. Certainly …
ANN
A lot of people want the physical thing.
ELISE
That’s my experience.
ANN
But when somebody special –
ELISE
Absolutely the same thing with me.
ANN
Then there is an immediate – I want a word.
ELISE
Rapport –
ANN
Rapport –
ELISE
Yes?
ANN
It’s going to be more than physical. Though of course it may be physical as well.
ELISE
As well. Of course.
ANN
It will in fact be better for the physical thing will be based on something real.
ELISE
That’s tremendously exciting.
ANN
It will be based on our respect for each other’s minds.
ELISE
Rather than our bodies.
ANN
You know.
ELISE
I know.
ANN
Don’t you think we have something?
ELISE
Ann, I’ve no sooner sat down than –
ANN
I don’t mean to rush you.
ELISE
And in front of Joanne.
ANN
I know.
ELISE
Oh I don’t mean others physically, though there have been others – physically. I mean I’m not young enough to imagine … Let’s say I’ve woken up more times than I’ve been to bed. I’m not young enough to think things will ever be different.
ANN
I don’t want to crowd you out.
ELISE
No.
ANN
I mean it.
ELISE
Yes.
ANN
No I mean –
ELISE
Listen.
ANN
Yes.
ELISE
We’ll have a go.
JOANNE
Is this a private game or can anyone join in?
ELISE
It is for two players.
ANN
Elise and I.
ELISE
Love is not a game. The love of a man –
ANN
Here played by me –
ELISE
For a woman –
ANN
Elise –
ELISE
Is the yolk of the cosmic egg. The good bit.
JOANNE
I see you’re going to be foolish all night.
ELISE
I’ve come from the graveyard where my father is buried into the light of a room where a man sits and waits not attending the service, not invited. His room has white walls and enough books to go round and – oh – he has, I cannot describe, it he has wise eyes and is peaceful and well liked and contented in the evening, and can forget, is able to forget.
ANN
I’m walking with a dog across a hillside and can see the farm where he is mending a barn door at which he is hopeless, as he is at most practical things, but I keep it in me that I don’t think he’s very good at things, as he is nice and as he is a bit soulful.
JOANNE
I’m lying with my legs open being licked off by a dog. He is brave and nice and has wise eyes.
ANN
Your hair’s all wet.
JOANNE
I fell in the bath.
ANN
I hope it taught you a lesson.
ELISE
Describe his prick.
ANN
Uncircumcized.
JOANNE
You’ve got slovenly minds and worse bodies and why I should expend this energy on you I don’t know. What’s wrong is not the system but that you poor cheap victims of the thing should absurdly see yourself as winners.
ELISE
There’s something in what she says.
ANN
I admire her for saying it.
ELISE
She’s certainly got guts.
ANN
And a hell of a way with words.
ELISE
You’ve got to admire her.
ANN
Now shut up.
ELISE
How long’s his prick?
ANN
Never measured it. Too satisfied to care.
JOANNE
If the length of a man’s penis were the measure of his worth then life would fall very easily into place.
ELISE
At my husband’s school –
JOANNE
Your what? Your husband?
ELISE
I am married, you know.
JOANNE
I never knew that.
ANN
Roger.
JOANNE
You’re married? And you persist in this fantasy that marriage is good and men were made for women?
ELISE
Like falling off a horse. You get back on again.
JOANNE
My God!
ELISE
You carry on. I’ve still got his shares. If the facts of all this depress you, let’s stop now rather than carry on. Roger meant lots to me, more than you could guess from the transcript of the divorce proceedings which is in itself an unsung opera.
ANN
If the memory of him obtrudes into our lovemaking.
ELISE
We must go on.
ANN
Is Joanne in the way?
ELISE
Leave her.
JOANNE
Babylonian whore.
ANN
If when I feel you you can feel no pain.
ELISE
Relax.
ANN
Can we make it? Over the years and past the debris into the rosetrees and the valley.
ELISE
Over the hollyhocks and the chrysanthemums into the waterfall and the clearing past the breakfasts and the crying and the –
ANN
Rosetrees.
ELISE
Past the rosetrees into a clearing. Help me into the clearing.
ANN
Can we make it?
ELISE
O Desdemona! Heaven forfend that I, to whom thou hast entrusted love, here, here on this teeming soil, that hast our meeting here entrusted to the earth, should, with mine own hand, pluck my dagger from my side, and with deliberate stealth make to plunder that which I have made my own.
ANN
Hush sweet Ophelia, let not the ardour of thy love thy temper overthrow.
ELISE
If we settled in advance for less than what we wanted, admitted from the start it was impossible to do the thing properly, would that be more satisfactory?
ANN
No.
ELISE
Is there a way, could there be a way of starting a relationship that wasn’t going to end in confusion and turning away at parties to avoid the eye of the person who knew you?
ANN
Maybe someone whose balls you’ve played with while they were asleep.
ELISE
Is there a way of coming to them and looking them in the eye and being honest and free?
ANN
If I took you, if I took you inside me –
ELISE
Other way round.
ANN
Sorry, if you took me inside you, would you wonder if I cried suddenly at night or fled to London or forgot a meeting.
ELISE
How can I tell you what an affair with a woman like me would be like? I’m flirtatious, horribly romantic and unreliable.
ANN
And as a man, I’m prone to sudden anger, like a lion in the way I am.
ELISE
I’m like a cheetah.
ANN
I’m like a lion.
ELISE
I’m like a gnu.
ANN
I’m like a hippopotamus.
ELISE
If there were some way of expressing to you directly the likelihood, the probability of disaster, then you might back away and say you didn’t want to get hurt.
ANN
If you could see as I do the hope of the world lying in women being different from men, I’ve always put them on a pedestal – they’re kinder and better able to cope.
ELISE
In this whirligig.
ANN
In this vortex.
ELISE
In this whirligig there are no masters. There is man. There is woman.
ANN
There is desert.
ELISE
Desert?
ANN
Against the elements, man, woman.
ELISE
There is desert. I wish it were possible. What do you think?
JOANNE
I think you’re nuts and we’ve been through this before.
ELISE
But this time a real relationship –
JOANNE
The number of times I’ve heard you say you were a gnu and Ann respond with the unlikely information that she’s a hippopotamus are really beyond counting. If it ever came to anything, I wouldn’t mind, but the evening drags on until the gnu turns to the hippopotamus and says shall we watch News at Ten?
ELISE
There ought to be a way of starting a relationship as you mean to go on. What happens now?
ANN
I don’t know. You’ve done more of this than I have.
ELISE
That’s not a very nice thing to say.
ANN
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it.
ELISE
Forget it.
ANN
Elise, let it be now.
ELISE
Are you ready?
ANN
I can’t wait.
ELISE
I’m so scared at this stage.
ANN
This is an inevitable stage. Think of it as expression.
JOANNE
Stop.
ANN
Why?
JOANNE
In front of me.
ANN
Undress.
JOANNE
‘The lyric fluency of Ozu is the nearest the Japanese cinema gets to Chekhov.’ Discuss.
ELISE
What time is it?
JOANNE
Five.
ELISE
Morning?
JOANNE
Afternoon.
ELISE
What’s happening?
JOANNE
Ann is teaching chemistry. I am reading drivel. Are you feeling any better?
ELISE
No.
JOANNE
‘Donald Duck’s dribblings of premature ejaculation symbolize the failure of Western man …’
ELISE
Can you see anything?
JOANNE
No.
ELISE
It’s coming all right. I have a sudden passion for pineapple. I’d really love a slice of pineapple.
JOANNE
Yesterday it’s prunes, today it’s pineapple. You don’t fool anybody.
ELISE
Won’t anyone believe me?
JOANNE
You’ll damage the little bastard.
ELISE
Give it a lively ride.
JOANNE
You’re so sure it’s a boy.
ELISE
I want a boy. You believe me then.
JOANNE
I think it shows great imagination.
ELISE
You believe it exists.
JOANNE
I think it’s the most wonderful thing.
ELISE
I don’t want to do myself damage.
JOANNE
Of course not. I still say you’ve been screwed.
ELISE
And I say I haven’t.
JOANNE
It doesn’t happen like that.
ELISE
It happened this time.
JOANNE
You can’t be pregnant if you haven’t been laid. It’s never happened before.
ELISE
Once.
JOANNE
That doesn’t count.
ELISE
I may have a Messiah.
JOANNE
You’ll never convince me. It was a vow, a vow mutually agreed. No men. Pure feminism, pure love. Brackenhurst inches the world forward. You agreed.
ELISE
I never agreed.
JOANNE
I won’t read this rubbish. It was agreed between us that it was possible to create a society of women. That was fine. As long as no one betrayed the ideal, I tolerated dissent. But then Brackenhurst fell apart. Brackenhurst is pure feminism. Brackenhurst inches the world forward. The falling apart was in this manner
ELISE
She got the fun, I got the baby. She and I were very close.
JOANNE
Exactly.
ELISE
You don’t resent us loving each other?
JOANNE
You’re not in love. It is a conspiracy.
ELISE
There was very little else around.
JOANNE
I am very little else, I suppose.
ELISE
You’re not really mature. And you seem to provide yourself with all the loving you need.
JOANNE
Brackenhurst inches the world forward. I’ve taken to smoking.
ELISE
Not the only sign of decay.
JOANNE
My hair’s falling out with arsenic poisoning and my nails have gone soft.
ELISE
It’s all fantasy.
JOANNE
You thinking yourself pregnant and me thinking myself dead.
ELISE
Murdered.
JOANNE
Yes.
ELISE
Why should she want to kill you?
JOANNE
Why does she keep me here?
ELISE
You’re her pupil, really. You’re the only one now, apart from that one downstairs.
JOANNE
I always knew Bossy Lucrecia would outlive the rest.
ANN
Ann has made her Head Girl.
JOANNE
As she’s the only one, it’s not much of an honour.
ELISE
Symbolic.
JOANNE
Ugh, motherhood suits you. How can you?
ELISE
What?
JOANNE
Knit. Aren’t you ashamed? Doesn’t it mean anything to be cast in a forever and always role of the most blatant submission?
ELISE
I like it.
JOANNE
Have you never wanted to change?
ELISE
Women have babies.
JOANNE
So?
ELISE
It’s biological. They dive for the breast.
JOANNE
But the care of babies? Is that all you look forward to?
ELISE
I spent the first half of my life on my back. I want something to show for it.
JOANNE
But the two should be connected. Years of indulgence – nothing. Then you stop and suddenly you’re pregnant. Now you’ll spend the rest of your life tending a kid while life happens around you.
ELISE
Nothing ever happens at Brackenhurst.
JOANNE
I don’t mean Brackenhurst, I mean the world.
ELISE
Brackenhurst inches the world forward, Brackenhurst …
JOANNE
All right. That can’t be all you want.
ELISE
My mother was a Communist. She had three houses, a large private income, a couple of scarcely literate novelist lovers and a small pink card that said she was a member of the Communist Party. My father had very little to do with her apart from their initial union, a policy he was wise to maintain for all his thirty-seven years. Spent mostly as a schoolteacher before his early death when a gold crucifix suspended from the ceiling of Chartres Cathedral fell on his head. Hence my hatred of religion. And of teaching. So I wasn’t very political from the start. My mother’s money was in patent medicine. My father’s heart was in culture. Which is probably why I’m sick of watching you two fight it out. I’ve never seen the need to get that worked up.
JOANNE
I thought you were working class.
ELISE
I never said so. I shall devote my life to rearing children.
JOANNE
It soon won’t be necessary. This might interest you.
ELISE
Babies?
JOANNE
Some other method.
ELISE
A better method?
JOANNE
Who knows?
ELISE
And will there still be love?
JOANNE
If you want it.
ELISE
Pleasures of the body?
JOANNE
Pleasures of the mind.
ELISE
I don’t want your evolution.
JOANNE
No choice.
ELISE
And will we ever be happy?
JOANNE
Don’t be trivial.
ELISE
I don’t call it – ow, it kicked.
JOANNE
Impossible.
ELISE
I felt it.
JOANNE
I believe you felt it, but I don’t believe it kicked. Taste this.
ELISE
What is it?
JOANNE
This is my mashed potato. We had it for lunch, I’d like you to try some. It’s poisoned.
ELISE
Eugh, it’s vile.
JOANNE
Taste some, titface.
ELISE
Mashed potato.
JOANNE
I said.
ELISE
I think it’s very good.
JOANNE
Are you getting that bitter taste – acid tinge?
ELISE
No. How did you get it?
JOANNE
I scooped it off the plate when Ann wasn’t looking. It’s blatantly poisoned. I have to get rid of it.
ELISE
There’s no one else to tell.
JOANNE
True.
ELISE
We ought to see more people.
JOANNE
I’ve suddenly seen what’s dogged me all along. Ann is the father of your child.
ELISE
Hardly.
JOANNE
The X chromosome ascends.
ELISE
Ha ha.
JOANNE
I’ve been thinking all day about your story and there’s one thing missing. Where’s the man?
ELISE
Do you think I like being abnormal?
JOANNE
It’s biologically possible. Ann is the father.
ELISE
When it first happened I was hell’s ashamed. Who wants a baby and not know how?
JOANNE
It’s obviously Ann’s.
ELISE
You agree it exists.
JOANNE
I’ve changed my theory to fit the facts.
ELISE
How could Ann have done it?
JOANNE
You remember that night?
ELISE
I’m not asking when, I’m asking how.
JOANNE
What was that business about, the night I fainted? The night you did your act in front of me?
ELISE
Oh. Joke.
JOANNE
This child’s not going to do what you want. It won’t get you out of here. It is incestuous offspring of this place.
ELISE
It is the hope I have of happiness.
JOANNE
I’m sorry for you then. I’m changing for supper.
ELISE
There’s no need to dress behind there.
JOANNE
Doesn’t matter.
ELISE
I wouldn’t be embarrassed to see your body.
JOANNE
Please.
ELISE
I’d quite like it.
JOANNE
I don’t want to be watched all the time.
ELISE
There’s no need to be so prudish.
JOANNE
I am not a prude. I just –
ELISE
What?
JOANNE
For Christ’s sake leave me alone.
ELISE
Body body body body body.
JOANNE
AAAAH!
ELISE
Joanne. Joanne, are you all right? Are you OK in there?
JOANNE
And your child will very probably be stillborn.
ELISE
You worried me.
JOANNE
Not really.
ELISE
If I have a boy I’ll call it Joseph, but if it’s a girl Joanne.
JOANNE
Ha ha.
ELISE
I mean it. You don’t know how much I love you.
JOANNE
Elise, will you please be quiet?
ELISE
You don’t know how easy you are to upset. You’re a joy.
ANN
Lucrecia’s chemistry is definitely improving.
JOANNE
Daddy!
ANN
Are you any better, Elise?
ELISE
I’m sure I’m pregnant.
ANN
I’m giving everyone flu injections this year to prevent the school grinding to a halt.
JOANNE
Don’t bring that thing near me.
ELISE
Nor me. In my condition it’ll upset nature’s balance.
ANN
Joanne, I told you.
JOANNE
Very well.
ANN
Lucrecia –
JOANNE
Out of bed, earth mother, I’ve got to change your sheets.
ELISE
Do you think she’s murdering our last pupil?
JOANNE
Pump her full of vitamins to keep her breathing, more like.
ELISE
Why?
JOANNE
It’s mine.
ELISE
Pardon.
JOANNE
They’ll never get better. There’ll be no change. We could be shitting gold bricks here and no one would come to sweep up the dung after us. People don’t like Brackenhurst. It’s like all the other useless institutions – schools, ministries, theatres, museums, post offices – people will go a long way to avoid them. Look at those lawns and flowerbeds and fountains. Nobody wants to go where people gather. Who wants it?
ELISE
There’s mud on my slippers, Joanne. On my slippers, mud.
ANN
Well, Sherlock, tell me what you think.
ELISE
I haven’t been out of the house in them, Look.
JOANNE
Of course not. I mean, yes.
ANN
No, you mean yes?
JOANNE
I admit it, yes.
ELISE
You planted vegetables in my slippers.
JOANNE
Not in them. Wearing them. That’s how the mud got on them, sorry.
ELISE
The pom-poms will wilt if you get them wet.
JOANNE
It’s all in the past.
ANN
You’re cheerful, Joanne.
JOANNE
I’m sorry, does that spoil the atmosphere?
ANN
Not at all.
ELISE
There’s a trail of mud in fact right across the room.
JOANNE
It leads from the vegetable patch to your bed.
ELISE
Not that way it doesn’t.
JOANNE
I’ll do this bed, while you finish that.
ANN
I’ll help.
JOANNE
It’s OK.
ANN
Don’t put those dirty sheets on the floor.
JOANNE
They’re dirty.
ANN
No need to make them dirtier.
JOANNE
You look after them.
ELISE
They’re incredibly dirty.
JOANNE
I’ll do this side.
ELISE
Joanne, have you been growing vegetables in your bed?
JOANNE
No.
ANN
No you mean yes?
JOANNE
No I mean no.
ELISE
Well the world must be fighting its way through the floor.
ANN
You’re tunnelling your way out.
JOANNE
The Great Escape, John Sturges, 1963.
ANN
You’ve ruined my parquet floor in your malicious attempt to escape.
JOANNE
I thought I’d get away with it.
ANN
You thought I wouldn’t notice great piles of earth you’ve been throwing out the window.
JOANNE
I’ve been trying to mix it with the soil.
ANN
What about the great white patches of cold mashed potato, then?
JOANNE
That’s poisonous potato. You can see the plants have died out there.
ANN
The plants have suffocated under the weight of garbage you pour on to them.
JOANNE
It was the only place to put it.
ANN
What were you doing in the first place?
JOANNE
I wanted out.
ANN
You could have come and spoken to me. I would have listened.
JOANNE
I know.
ANN
Quiet, wait till you’re spoken to. Expectavi orationem mihi vero querelam adduxisti.
JOANNE
Look how far I got, look how near I was to getting out.
ANN
I knew all the time.
JOANNE
Like that dog. You know about that.
ANN
It’s your fault walking in the grounds at night.
JOANNE
You didn’t tell me you starved the thing. I was the first meat it had seen in weeks.
ANN
Alsatians can go for long periods without food.
JOANNE
Just see how near I was.
ELISE
Second bootee finito. Leggings now.
ANN
‘Dear Mum, How are you? It’s been a long time since I’ve written but we’ve been terribly busy this term – always like this in the Christmas term. I’ve hardly had time to sit down. What can I tell you about Brackenhurst?’
JOANNE
I thought the hols were very quiet. Through the summer months I dug so gently into the earth, towards great peacefulness, great rest.
ANN
‘These are not days, mother, in which private education is much valued. I sometimes feel we are out of step with this generation. It is a constant struggle to keep in tune with new ideas. However, a new cricket pavilion will go some way …’
JOANNE
I’m giving myself a time limit. If I’m not out of here by the time that child is born, I’ll kill myself.
ELISE
Agreed.
ANN
‘How is father? How is his face? Joanne and Elise send you their love. They are a constant source of help to me.’
JOANNE
I’m going to be sick.
ANN
‘We have Mrs Reginald Maudling coming for speech day next year. Rather a catch. Love, Ann.’ Elise, you remember mother?
JOANNE
Poisoner.
ANN
What?
JOANNE
You’re poisoning me.
ANN
How do you know?
JOANNE
Oesophagal pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhoea with traces of mucus, weakness, jaundice, restlessness, headache, dizziness, chills, cramps, irritability, paralysis, polyneuritis, anaesthesias, paresthesias, hyperceratosis of the palm and soles of the feet, cirrhosis of the liver, nausea, abdominal cramps, salivation, chronic nephritis in the cardiovascular system, dependent oedema, cardiac-failure.
ANN
Remedy?
JOANNE
Dimercaprol. Complete recovery six months.
ANN
The hockey championships of Brackenhurst.
JOANNE
This is serious.
ANN
The serious championship.
JOANNE
We need a fourth.
ELISE
I’m no good anyway, I’d as soon give up.
JOANNE
Certainly not. This is to the death.
ELISE
I can scarcely get across the pitch. I’m so far gone.
JOANNE
And here at Brackenhurst the tension is well nigh unbearable, with three prima donnas of the hockey circuit ranged in claw to claw fighting.
ANN
Precision great maturity skill wonderful effortlessness.
ANN
Brute power brilliant aim marvellous speed.
ANN
The odd fluke shot relieving general hopelessness.
ELISE
Thank you.
JOANNE
It would be much better if we had a fourth.
ELISE
Man.
ANN
Vigour and dash.
JOANNE
Con brio.
ANN
My goal.
JOANNE
That was practice. We hadn’t started properly.
ANN
That was not warming up. That was game. Elise?
ELISE
Wasn’t watching.
JOANNE
That’s right. Opt out.
ANN
What?
ELISE
Tattoos!
JOANNE
The criminal sisterhood
ANN
And scars.
JOANNE
I cut my wrists.
ANN
When?
JOANNE
Some months ago.
ANN
What happened?
JOANNE
Nothing. You’ve heard of haemophiliacs, well I’m a haemophobiac, couldn’t keep the wretched stuff flowing. Come on, serve.
ANN
The tattoos.
JOANNE
Everyone has them.
ANN
Who?
JOANNE
In Holloway.
ANN
In Holloway!
JOANNE
The prisoners tattoo their girlfriends’ names on their arms; but when they get out their pimps are angry because they say it drives off custom.
ANN
Let me see. Ann. Elise.
JOANNE
Leave me alone.
ANN
You’ve tattooed our names on your arm.
JOANNE
I’m taking a penalty. My pimp’ll be angry when I get out.
ELISE
Five minutes’ time.
ANN
Plenty can still happen.
ELISE
We’ll know in five minutes.
JOANNE
We’ve sat through this vast vacation waiting for damned anybody to enrol, face it, nobody’s coming.
ANN
Give it time. We are teachers first and foremost, you and I, plain strength it would be wrong to misapply.
ELISE
Five minutes and the term starts.
ANN
Unlock the doors.
JOANNE
Hardly any point. We know already.
ANN
That’s not true.
JOANNE
I think we’ll be able to control the flow.
ANN
You’re really back on form.
ELISE
She got her confidence back.
JOANNE
I do feel secure.
ELISE
Do I chalk up that last goal or not?
ANN
Let her have it.
JOANNE
Madame.
ANN
Bully.
JOANNE
I don’t want to keep you from your duties, my dear.
ANN
I call it poor sportsmanship when you needle insidiously and scratch at subjects that are nothing to do with the game in hand.
JOANNE
We’re only playing to pass the time, thanks to your scholastic success. We should be out on cocoa duty in the normal way of things, or lugging trunks up abandoned staircases to the dorm, instead of staging the international championship of all time.
ANN
We know why Brackenhurst has hit a poor patch. One person teaching knife throwing, Jew baiting, guerrilla antics and sexual self-help has sharply influenced enrolment figures.
JOANNE
Fire me.
ANN
Quite. Service.
JOANNE
Your own goal.
ELISE
To you?
JOANNE
To me. She’s mad. Give me the slipper.
ANN
Testing, testing 1–2–3–4–5 –
ELISE
It works.
JOANNE
Four weeks’ work and it had better.
ANN
Testing. Report immediately to your headmistress. Do not collect two hundred pounds, do not pass go.
JOANNE
Give me another.
ELISE
My stomach is in a way very beautiful.
JOANNE
It would need a woman to fancy you. You really look revolting.
ELISE
Doesn’t matter, you used to say, what women look like. Physical appearance was a snare, something men had invented to grade off women.
JOANNE
One day – all women – are going to be equal.
ELISE
It’s not so much that women aren’t equal. It’s more that they’re ugly.
ANN
What the world needs now is love, sweet love.
JOANNE
Give over.
ELISE
When I first learnt I was pregnant and I didn’t go to a doctor by the way, just stopped getting the curse and watched myself inflate, then I felt the joy of a way to leave Brackenhurst. Now I’ve had the bugger in my womb so long I feel I’ve lugged it from here to Singapore.
JOANNE
There are times when I feel I’ve suffered so much that the world has just got to move over and yield.
ELISE
It’s her.
JOANNE
The revolutionary party has seized control of the radio station and therefore declares the revolution complete. End of revolution.
ANN
There’s no one. Not even Lucrecia. There are no pupils.
JOANNE
Total annihilation.
ANN
Very well.
ANN
That’s not the way I saw it.
JOANNE
The wrists I cut in summer several times. We have credentials of our suffering – all of us.
ELISE
My baby.
ANN
Is that the little baby? Ooh. Diddums. Can I come out now, Auntie? No you can’t – not for a month or two. Oh he’s crying.
ELISE
He wants a little peace. Joanne, lock the doors.
ANN
Is he crying? Ooh. Are you sad?
ELISE
It wasn’t worth waiting through the vac.
ANN
We held on.
ELISE
Really it was just delay.
ANN
What do you do now?
ELISE
Find a father.
ANN
Elise.
ELISE
It’s well enough for you. You have a man.
ANN
I never knew Haskins. I pretended.
ELISE
But you said.
ANN
Think I’d sleep with a tradesman? I’ve got some pride left.
ELISE
Virility attracted you.
ANN
I just wanted to annoy her.
ELISE
While you were poisoning her.
ANN
Yes.
ELISE
This is not the way women speak together, it’s not the way they live. It doesn’t ring true.
ANN
The slow sprinkling of arsenic seemed as humane a way as possible. I’ve not thought Joanne evil or depraved. Wayward more like and needing me.
JOANNE
So I can go now?
ELISE
I just wanted to say to you, Joanne, I think you’re bloody marvellous and your generation is more bloody marvellous than any before it. And if ever I want a friend for life, I’ll want you.
JOANNE
Women are going to be free one day to behave as they choose. We’re only so far fledglings on this earth.
ANN
Break it up.
ELISE
There was no virgin birth. There are simply declining standards in private education and that is all.
JOANNE
Private schools were always like this. We’re not unusual.
ANN
I know what you feel. We’ve all been brought up to be sold out and pitied and scorned and screwed and abused. She’s right. So what?
JOANNE
So?
ANN
Well, exactly.
JOANNE
Why are the workers silent, Ann? Why does the revolution land with such a sigh? Twenty-five years the war is over, and everyone trying to get the workers to respond. And they won’t. Where are the working women? Lulled by romantic love and getting home to cook the dinner.
ANN
I was weaned on R. A. Butler and the Beveridge report, so I don’t know what you’re talking about.
JOANNE
Why have half the world, the women, vowed never to fight, to be slow to anger, not to destroy the world?
ANN
If you’d ever had anything but some generalized complaint I could sympathize. But you don’t even know what you want. Some unstated alternative that evaporates like your breath on the air.
JOANNE
Help pack these away.
ANN
Those are good chairs you’re manhandling. What are you doing?
JOANNE
Historic evolution. The end of Brackenhurst. Citizen Kane. Orson Welles. 1942.
ANN
I’ve no intention.
JOANNE
This is the end of it.
ANN
Please don’t leave me. Please.
JOANNE
After the revolution, retribution.
ELISE
Look what I’ve been hiding in the wine cellar.
JOANNE
Get out the way.
ELISE
See my bike. I’ll be in Gloucestershire by dawn.
JOANNE
Shut up.
ELISE
Down the M1, pausing only for childbirth at an all-night caff.
JOANNE
Shut up. This is my revolution.
ANN
Don’t think I can’t take a joke, Joanne.
ELISE
Give it to her, give it to her, Joanne.
ANN
I just –
ELISE
Let her have it.
JOANNE
Shall I?
ELISE
Yes.
JOANNE
Yes?
ELISE
Yes.
JOANNE
No.
ELISE
Some gladiators you turned out to be. I’ve spent the last year watching you two throw each other round like Indian clubs.
JOANNE
We’re all just sorry school is closing down.
ELISE
Why?
JOANNE
We’re all just sorry.
ELISE
There’s nothing in our lives that’s worth redeeming, take my word for it. We’re teachers and that’s all, and you two are good teachers because there’s nothing in your lives that doesn’t constitute a lesson. And while you’ve been talking the children have left. You’ve lived so long on other people’s behalf you’ve ceased to recognize yourselves. There’s nothing here worth keeping and certainly nothing holds us together. My bike.
ANN
Elise.
JOANNE
Let her be.
ANN
Your fault.
JOANNE
Yours.
ANN
Look what you’ve done to her.
JOANNE
If women are ever to be strong, they’ve got to be strong …
ANN
Jo-jo.
JOANNE
And lighthearted. She is right.
ANN
This school worked for a long time before you came and it can work again.
JOANNE
Sure.
ANN
We can make it work. Circulate Burke’s Peerage for new pupils. Build up towards next term.
JOANNE
She is right.
ELISE
It’s gone. There was a great wet fart and it had gone.
JOANNE
Well then –
INCH
Right. Let’s smash the place up.
ARTHUR
Motorbike. How is she?
INCH
All right. They’re liftin’ ’er out the van now.
ARTHUR

LAURA
Are you set up, Inch, it’s very late?
INCH
Got Maggie out?
LAURA
They’re getting her down the drive.
ARTHUR
And hello, Laura.
LAURA
And hello, Arthur. Some bastard put sugar in the petrol tank, that’s why we’re late.
ARTHUR
It’s good to see you.
LAURA
How long can you stay?
ARTHUR
How long do you want?
LAURA
Well …
ARTHUR
Saraffian said he thought she might be on the way down.
LAURA
How Saraffian’s meant to know, sitting in that office all day …
ARTHUR
He has a manager’s nose. He’s like a truffle pig, he can smell heroin at fifty paces.
LAURA
Don’t be absurd, dumbo. It’s not smack, it’s booze. Liquid boredom. Twice a day she flips out.
WILSON
Game.
NASH
Wot’s it to be?
WILSON
Pope’s balls. The game is the most borin’ and useless piece of information you can think of. Thus the Pope ’as balls.
NASH
Right.
WILSON
Away you go.
NASH
The town of Nottingham was once called Snottingham.
WILSON
Yeah, that’s borin’.
NASH
Thank you, pal, your go.
WILSON
Efrem Zimbalist’s first wife’s name was Alma Gluck.
NASH
Well done, Wilson, that’s really dull.
INCH
Diana Dors’ real name was Diana Fluck.
NASH
Hello, Arthur.
ARTHUR
Nashy. How are you?
INCH
Or Diana Clunt, I can’t remember which.
WILSON
The capital of Burundi is Bujumbura.
INCH
Or possibly Diana Clocksucker, but I think I would’ve remembered that.
LAURA
She starts drinking at breakfast, she passes out after lunch, then she’s up for supper, ready for the show. Then after the show she starts drinking. At two-thirty she’s out again. Morning she gets up. And drinks. She’s a great professional. Never misses a show.
ARTHUR
Pills?
LAURA
No.
ARTHUR
Reds?
LAURA
No. Blue heavens, no. Yellow jackets, no. Bennies, no. No goofballs, no dexies, no dollies.
ARTHUR
Still no acid?
LAURA
No.
ARTHUR
And the heroin?
LAURA
No. She just drinks.
ARTHUR
What is she, some kind of pervert?
LAURA
No aeroplane glue, no household cement, no banana peel, no fingernail polish remover, no nutmeg, no paintstripper. No one in the world but her and Johnny Walker.
ARTHUR
And the singing?
LAURA
The singing’s OK.
INCH
Waiter, can you take ’er up to a bathroom?
SNEAD
Sir.
ARTHUR

NASH
And where the ’ell are we?
WILSON
At this moment in time on planet earth the dead outnumber the living by thirty to one.
LAURA
She doesn’t speak very warmly of you.
ARTHUR
I’m not meant to drag round the country, am I?
LAURA
Or of me.
ARTHUR
Still sings my songs.
LAURA
She’d prefer not to.
ARTHUR
I’m sure.
LAURA
She’d prefer to get up there and scream.
ARTHUR

SMEGS
Couple of slags here say anyone fancy a blow-job?
ARTHUR
A blow-job. Do I want a blow-job?
LAURA
How did they get in here?
SMEGS
Inch? Blow-job?
ARTHUR
Bound to turn out like a Chinese meal. Half an hour later and you need another.
INCH
Butterfly flicks, do they do butterfly flicks?
SMEGS
Ask them.
INCH
Sure.
LAURA
Do you have to do that in here?
PEYOTE
Fuck off.
INCH
But will they do butterfly flicks with a roadie?
SMEGS
Not a chance.
ARTHUR
Isn’t he meant to be …
SMEGS
What?
ARTHUR
Setting up. You’re an hour late.
LAURA
Does this look all right?
SMEGS
It’s up to him.
ARTHUR
Why don’t you go and help him?
SMEGS
Because we’re artists.
ARTHUR
All right.
SMEGS
See?
LAURA
Artists don’t set up.
SMEGS
You don’t ask Oistrakh to go out and strangle the cat.
INCH
They do blow-jobs wiv singers, but nothin’ below bass guitar.
ARTHUR
That’s right, love, keep your standards up.
PEYOTE
I play fuckin’ bass guitar.
SMEGS
Artists. I mean. Keith Moon’s chauffeur got run over, he said chauffeurs are two a penny, it’s blokes like me what are irreplaceable.
WILSON
There is no word in the English language as rhymes with ‘orange’.
NASH
Hey, these valiums, do they go with my shirt?
SNEAD
Is that to be everything, sir?
INCH
No, you gotta get ’er clothes off and get ’er into the bath.
SNEAD
Sir?
INCH
You think I’m jokin’?
SNEAD
Sir?
INCH
We’re gonna ’ave to wash ’er. Do you wanna know wot that’s like?
SNEAD
Sir?
INCH
Well, ’ave you ever seen ’em cleanin’ St Paul’s?
ARTHUR
Is that what happens every day?
LAURA
Pretend not to notice, what would you do?
ARTHUR
What …
LAURA
There’s no choice. Stoke tomorrow. Then Keele. Bradford. Southampton. Quick one in Amsterdam. Back to Glasgow. Then they claim California, but nobody believes it.
ARTHUR
Saraffian’s mad.
LAURA
Not Saraffian’s idea. It’s her. She wants to hit San Francisco on her knees.
ARTHUR
What’s the money?
LAURA
A hundred and twenty, no more. It won’t cover overheads, whatever it is. But she … likes to keep busy.
SMEGS
All this jumping on the spot makes you feel famous. But it’s no real substitute for people knowing your name.
WILSON
Arfer.
ARTHUR
Yes.
WILSON
Your contribution.
ARTHUR
H. G. Wells was attractive to women because his breath smelt of honey.
WILSON
Very nice.
NASH
I enjoyed that.
WILSON
Very nice.
ANSON
Are we nearly …
ARTHUR
There’s a plug.
ANSON
What?
ARTHUR
We’re waiting to mend a plug. Look. Over there.
ANSON
I’m the organizer. The booking. You are … ninety minutes late you know. Couldn’t someone … one of you mend it yourselves.
ARTHUR
Arms like penguins I’m afraid.
ANSON
I see.
NASH
Three-quarters of all children are born before breakfast.
INCH
’Ave you got ’er dress?
LAURA
Here. Tonight Miss Frisby is in peach.
SNEAD
Will that be everything, sir?
INCH
Why not lie down there and I’ll walk all over yer?
SNEAD
Sir.
INCH
Jus’ can’t get any decent room service round ’ere.
NASH
Every time we breathe we inhale several million molecules that was exhaled by Leonardo da Vinci …
WILSON
No, no, Nashy.
NASH
Wot?
WILSON
You don’ understand, that’s really quite interestin’, Leonardo, I mean, it’s far too interestin’ …
ARTHUR
I’m thinking of marketing a pork pie, a new kind of pork pie, which when you put the knife through the pastry will let out an agonized honk, as of a pig being slaughtered. It would do well.
ARTHUR
A tip is it Mr Snead, is that what you’re after?
SNEAD
Sir?
ARTHUR
Don’t look at us, pal, we’re too famous, we’re like the Queen, we don’t carry actual money.
SNEAD
Sir?
WILSON
An’ you’re playin’ it far too fast.
INCH
She says will Arfer ’elp ’er out the bath?
PEYOTE
Waiter.
SNEAD
Sir?
PEYOTE
Fuck off.
ARTHUR
Come on, Arthur, come on boy, come and meet Maggie. Come on, come on boy.
PEYOTE
Wot’s that creep doin’ ’ere?
LAURA
If …
PEYOTE
Never said it.
LAURA
Where the others?
PEYOTE
I ’ate Canterbury. Every time we come to Canterbury I swear never to come again.
LAURA
So do I. Except this is Cambridge.
PEYOTE
Yeah. Look.
LAURA
T’rific.
WILSON
It should be dull.
PEYOTE
The bag.
LAURA
What?
PEYOTE
The bag. Pass me the bag.
LAURA
This is Maggie’s.
PEYOTE
Pass me the fuckin’ bag.
LAURA
That …
PEYOTE
Uh. Jus’ borrowed ’er bag.
ANSON
Has there been any …
LAURA
Progress? No.
PEYOTE
She en’t bin busted as often as me.
LAURA
That would be quite hard, Peyote. I mean, you would have to stand on street corners stuffing tabs up traffic wardens’ nostrils to get yourself busted quite as often as you.
PEYOTE
Fuck off.
ANSON
Is Miss Frisby with you?
LAURA
She’s just being sandblasted next door. Why don’t you sit down?
ANSON
Thank you.
LAURA
Did you see her?
ARTHUR
What is she on?
LAURA
Huh, did she recognize you?
ARTHUR
She said, who let this pieca shit in here?
LAURA
She recognized you.
ARTHUR
Yes.
LAURA
I must call Saraffian. Do you know where there’s a phone?
ANSON
In the porter’s …
LAURA
Lodge? Thank you.
ARTHUR
He doesn’t care. As long as they stagger on to the stage. Get their hands somewhere near the guitar. Yes, Peyote?
PEYOTE
Fuck off.
ARTHUR
I don’t care either. Butcher my tunes. Forget my lyrics. Steal my royalties. I expect it.
LAURA
Sure.
ARTHUR
Just tell me what she’s on.
LAURA
Arthur, you lived with her …
ARTHUR
Have you let her get hooked? Well? Have you let her get hooked again?
LAURA
Have I?
ARTHUR
Well?
ANSON
Have you had a look where you’re …
ARTHUR
Peyote, do you know what she’s on?
PEYOTE
She’s mainlinin’ string. Pullin’ it through ’er veins.
ANSON
Do you want to have a look at …
ARTHUR
Little fella, why don’t you ever get through a …
ANSON
Sentence. I know. It’s … I just hear what I’m saying and it always sounds so dreary and second-hand I just am … too fastidious to …
ARTHUR
Finish.
ANSON
Right.
ARTHUR
She’s in the bathroom, walk right up.
ANSON
Does she have any clothes on?
ARTHUR
It’s never stopped her before.
ANSON
Ah.
ARTHUR
What you going to ask her?
ANSON
Oh … general things. About the role of popular music in society.
ARTHUR
Yes, well, that’s a very good subject. Very good subject. You could even ask Peyote here about that. He has a lot of words to say on that. Well, not a lot. Actually he has two. Off and fuck. Only usually he contrives to put them the other way round.
ANSON
Hmph.
PEYOTE
Ah.
ANSON
Squeamish. Grotesquely squeamish for a medical student. It’s a problem. Really. You call that shooting up?
PEYOTE
Uh-huh.
ANSON
Is that heroin?
PEYOTE
Preludin.
ANSON
Ah. Preludin is a fuck-pump, I think I’m right. I know that much. It enlarges your sexual capacity. You’re meant to stay hard for twenty-four hours, is that not … I believe that’s right.
PEYOTE
Don’t touch it.
INCH
Right.
ANSON
Are you nearly …
INCH
Jus’ gotta change this plug.
ANSON
Will it take very long?
INCH
Don’t know, it’s a technical thing.
ANSON
Is it going to be good tonight?
INCH
It’s gettin’ really nasty out there.
ANSON
What?
INCH
The audience. They’re stamping all over the lawn. Fuck.
ANSON
What?
INCH
Forgotten the flowers.
ANSON
Are you …
SNEAD
Everyone’s now ready for the orchestra, sir.
INCH
Tell ’em they’re jus’ gettin’ inta their dickies.
SNEAD
I think you’ll have to make some announcement, sir. They’re getting very restless having to wait.
ANSON
Tell them … er … tell them they’re coming just as fast as they can.
ARTHUR
Listen, they got the place right, didn’t they? That’s three-quarters of the battle. The time, the time is a sophisticated detail.
ANSON
I don’t know, Mr Snead.
PEYOTE
Wot is this place, anyway?
ARTHUR
You are in what scientists now know to be a black hole, Peyote. Floating free, an airless, lightless, dayless, nightless time-lock, a cosmic accident called Jesus College Ball.
PEYOTE
Jesus.
ARTHUR
College Ball.
PEYOTE
What does it mean?
ARTHUR
It means the college at which I was educated. Yes, Mr Snead?
LAURA
It means undergraduates.
ARTHUR
Narcissists.
LAURA
Yahoos.
ARTHUR
Intellectuals.
WILSON
Internal memorandum. Rhyl Town Hall. The life expectancy of a civic deckchair is now a season and a half.
LAURA
He used to clip tickets.
ARTHUR
I was at this college. I know Mr Snead of old. Give me that.
THANKS
don’t waste your energy. Because that’s what they want. They invent a few rules that don’t mean anything so that you can ruin your health trying to change them. Then overnight they re-draft them because they didn’t really matter in the first place. One day it’s a revolution to say fuck on the bus. Next day it’s the only way to get a ticket. That’s how the system works. An obstacle course. Unimportant. Well, perhaps.
NASH
The word Cicero literally means chick-pea.
ANSON
Oh God. I think I’d better … go and …
LAURA
Don’t. Don’t go away.
ARTHUR
Sit down, tell us something about yourself.
ANSON
I’m sorry. It’s just so late. I …
ARTHUR
People appreciate things more when they’ve had to wait.
ANSON
That’s not how we advertised …
ARTHUR
Let them suffer.
ANSON
We didn’t sell the tickets on the quality of the suffering we could offer.
ARTHUR
Well done. Whole sentence. This band has converted more people to classical music than any other human form of torture.
ANSON
I don’t understand why …
ARTHUR
They come out saying, please, please, give me a drip in a bucket.
INCH
She says she’s not going on tonight.
ANSON
On no.
ARTHUR
Uh, it’s fine. Don’t panic.
INCH
It’s quite all right, it’s fine.
ARTHUR
The nights she’s not going on are fine. It’s the nights she can’t wait to get on, they’re the ones to watch for.
WILSON
Right.
SMEGS
How we doing?
LAURA
Fine.
ARTHUR
Fine.
WILSON
Fine.
SMEGS
Must be almost time.
ANSON
Yes.
WILSON
Only one man ’as actually died on television. In a television studio. ’E was on a stool, talkin’ about ’ealth food, about honey, an’ ’e jus’ fell over an’ died.
NASH
Fantastic.
WILSON
Yeah.
PEYOTE
It’s so good, it’s so very good …
SMEGS
I wouldn’t have minded a sound check.
ARTHUR
When did you last have one of those?
SMEGS
Barnsley, Halifax. I don’t know. They carry me about in a sealed container. And sometimes the seasons change. Or we run over a dog. Or they change the design on my cigarette pack.
ARTHUR
Well …
SMEGS
I don’t know.
ARTHUR
It seems to be what she wants.
SMEGS
It’s needless you know. It just makes her feel good.
ARTHUR
How is she to you?
LAURA
Unspeakable.
ARTHUR
Ah.
LAURA
She treats me barely human.
ARTHUR
Still?
LAURA
More than ever. She is jealous.
ARTHUR
I don’t see …
PEYOTE
There’s a wheel comin’ off the van.
ARTHUR
It’s all right, Peyote, it’s just a brain cell dying.
PEYOTE
It’s comin’ off.
SMEGS
It’ll be horses in a minute, on sweeties he always has horses.
ANSON
I’m sorry but I really do have to insist …
WILSON
What is wrong with you?
ANSON
I …
WILSON
I don’t think I’ve ever met a man wiv so little karma.
ANSON
How can I …
WILSON
You should leave your brain to a Buddhist ’ospital, they’d be very interested in you.
ANSON
We are waiting for one plug to be connected.
WILSON
Correct.
ANSON
It’s ridiculous.
WILSON
Don’t touch it.
ANSON
It’s absurd.
WILSON
Don’t fuckin’ touch it, you miserable little turd.
ARTHUR
Just leave it to Inch.
LAURA
Inch changes a mean plug.
WILSON
Right.
ARTHUR
Inch is a great roadie. Inch is the Panama Red of roadies.
ANSON
I’m …
ARTHUR
Just …
INCH
She says she’s goin’ on.
ARTHUR
Ah.
INCH
She says she can’t wait to get out there.
ARTHUR
Fine.
INCH
Now. What? I’m almost ready. There was somethin’.
ANSON
Plug.
INCH
I jus’ gotta change this plug.
ARTHUR
Fine. No hurry. Enjoy it.
INCH
I can’t work if I’m watched.
WILSON
A pullet is a pullet till the first time it moults. Then it’s a hen.
SMEGS
Sussex have never won the County Championship.
NASH
Marilyn Monroe was colour blind.
ARTHUR
Oscar Wilde died Sebastian Melmoth.
WILSON
Two gallons to one peck. Four pecks to one bushel. Eight bushels to one quarter. Four and a half quarters to a chaldron. One hectolitre per hectare equals one point one bushels per acre.
INCH
Right. Ready when you are.
ANSON
I think we’re ready.
INCH
OK, band?
WILSON
You might plug it in first, then we’ll join yer.
INCH
Fine.
WILSON
Not gonna walk across there if the plug’s not gonna work.
NASH
Get yer sneakers dirty.
WILSON
Quite.
ANSON
Well, everyone … let me say … go out there and break a leg.
WILSON
Wot an ’orrible little man.
NASH
’E’s very short, in’ ’e?
WILSON
Yeah, an’ that ’orrible black ’air. Makes ’im look like a lavatory brush.
SMEGS
Are we playing outside?
LAURA
Yes. On the lawn.
WILSON
Wot if it rains?
ARTHUR
Somebody had better …
SMEGS
Yes.
ARTHUR
Peyote.
PEYOTE
Horses.
SMEGS
Told you.
WILSON
Come on, Peyote, once through the Christmas oratorio.
NASH
You take one arm.
WILSON
Yeah, come in loud, eh Nashy? Drum all over ’im if you find ’e’s on the floor.
NASH
Will do.
PEYOTE
Horses poundin’ down the Mall.
WILSON
Right, right, Peyote.
SMEGS
Off we go.
WILSON
I wish we’d found somethin’ more, well, more kinda staggeringly borin’.
LAURA
Are you going to watch?
ARTHUR
What?
LAURA
Arthur.
ARTHUR
Yes, of course.
LAURA
I’ll see you later.
ARTHUR
Good.
LAURA
Arthur. Don’t drift away from me.
ARTHUR
Paganini played the violin so well … people said he was in league with the devil.
ARTHUR
Sorry about that.
WILSON
Necrophilia. Like fuckin’ the dead.
NASH
Amateur night at ’Arrods staff canteen.
WILSON
Like floggin’ a corpse.
NASH
The bastards.
WILSON
Fuck ’em.
NASH
Bastards.
SMEGS
What bastards.
WILSON
Do you know, some woofter comes up to me after the set, says I expectin’ somethin’ altogether more Dionysiac, I says Thursdays we’re Dionysiac, Fridays we’re jus’ fuckin’ awful.
ARTHUR
Right.
WILSON
Not that I care.
NASH
Right.
WILSON
Fuckin’ penguins.
ARTHUR
Right.
WILSON
I’m sitting there, I’m thinking the Marshall Stack’s up the spout an’ the Vox AC30 ’as gone on the blink, an’ not even the cloth-ears of Cambridge are fooled.
ARTHUR
And that’s just the first set.
NASH
Right.
WILSON
’Ow long till the next one?
ARTHUR
One o’clock. And the last at three-thirty. Then you can go to bed.
NASH
And you …
INCH
Sorry lads, bit o’ wobble on the Vox.
NASH
Wobble?
INCH
I’ve smeared it with pork fat, usually does the trick.
ANSON
I’ve come to interview Maggie. She told me …
WILSON
Last month in Miami, Florida …
NASH
Again.
ANSON
… to wait here.
WILSON
Jim Morrison of the Doors got it out. Not the only occasion this ’as ’appened. By no means. There is the example of our own P. J. Proby in the Croydon Odeon splittin’ ’is velvets from knee to crotch.
SMEGS
A great moment.
WILSON
The. Great. Moment.
ARTHUR
Yes.
WILSON
Slightly spoilt, it must be said, by the fact ’e then spontaneously split ’em every night till ’e was thrown off the tour.
ARTHUR
A mistake.
WILSON
Certainly. That bit. A mistake.
NASH
That’s right.
WILSON
Fuck ’em. An’ I know ’ow ’e feels.
ANSON
How do you think it went?
MAGGIE
Mother born in Hitchin, father born in Hatfield, so they met halfway and lived all their life in Stevenage. That’s how my interview begins.
ARTHUR
Oh, Jesus.
MAGGIE
Guess I must have been unhappy as a child …
ARTHUR
Oh, my God.
MAGGIE
Laura, I would love something to eat.
LAURA
Sure.
MAGGIE
Well, hello, Candy Peel, I thought it was you.
ARTHUR
Hallo, Maggie.
MAGGIE
Do you know why I call him Candy Peel? Because he has a small scrap of that substance hanging where real men …
ARTHUR
Thank you, Maggie, do the same for you.
MAGGIE
Do you know how you survive in Stevenage? You say this isn’t happening to me. That’s what you say. You say I may appear to be stifling to death in this crabby overheated mausoleum with these cringing waxworks who claim to be my parents. But it’s not true. I’m not here. I’m really some way away. And fifty foot up.
ARTHUR
Right.
MAGGIE
In fact I’m a Viking.
ARTHUR
Have you got this?
ANSON
I …
ARTHUR
I would write it down if I were you.
MAGGIE
In another age. I was a Viking. Reincarnation. I had a dream last night, I was called Thor, and I was wrapped in furs and I had strips of dried meat tied round my waist.
ARTHUR
Well, I think we can guess what the dried meat means, honey.
MAGGIE
No nourishment in Stevenage. You draw no strength. It’s like living on the moon.
ANSON
I have heard you saying that before.
MAGGIE
Listen, kid, you ask for an interview, I give you an interview. If you wanna new interview you gotta pay more, understand?
ANSON
Yes. Sorry.
MAGGIE
Like to rub my back, Arthur?
ARTHUR
Give me the bottle.
MAGGIE
I won’t drink before the show, Arthur. I just like to hold it, OK?
ANSON
Would you say …
MAGGIE
Yes?
ANSON
Would you say the ideas expressed in popular music … have had the desired effect of changing … society in any way?
MAGGIE
Hamburger. Dill pickle. That’s what I want.
LAURA
I got the gay boy back.
ARTHUR
Ah, come in, waiter.
MAGGIE
Hallo, ringer, must have been you in the tub just now.
SNEAD
Sir?
ARTHUR
Did you say sir?
MAGGIE
That’s all right, I’m just one of the boys.
ARTHUR
Hamburger, please, Mr Snead. With dill pickle.
MAGGIE
And relish and French fries. Coca-cola. And a banana pretty. And a vanilla ice with hot chocolate sauce. Chopped nuts. And some tinned peaches. And tomato sauce for the hamburger. With onion rings. And mayonnaise. And frankfurters. Frankfurters for everyone, OK? With French mustard. And some toasted cheese and tomato sandwiches. With chutney. On brown bread, by the way, I’m a health freak.
ARTHUR
Got that, Mr Snead?
SNEAD
I’m afraid I’ll have to send out for this. Do you think you could give me some money?
LAURA
Money?
MAGGIE
Don’t make with the jokes, ringer, they don’t go with the grovelling.
SNEAD
I can get you something from the college kitchen.
ARTHUR
OK, just get us whatever’s nice and greasy and answers to the name of Rover, OK?
SNEAD
Sir?
MAGGIE
Then the first time I heard Bessie Smith, that was somethin’.
ARTHUR
Off you go.
SNEAD
Sir.
MAGGIE
That was really somethin’. In a record shop, I was fourteen. Did you know that as well?
ANSON
Actually I … read your press release.
MAGGIE
Did you?
LAURA
I reckoned he should …
MAGGIE
Yes, well I do have some sort of life outside my press release. I can’t remember where I put it, but I do know I have it.
LAURA
Do you want to change for the next set?
MAGGIE
What you gawpin’ at?
ANSON
Looking at you.
MAGGIE
Still looking at the tragedy? That was over there. The girl with no life of her own. I left her over there.
ANSON
That easy?
MAGGIE
Tragedy’s easy. I pick it up, I sling it off. Like an overcoat.
ARTHUR
What is she on?
LAURA
Arthur.
ARTHUR
Will somebody please tell me what this girl is on?
MAGGIE
So I tell you the story of my life. Everyone in Stevenage hated me, they hated me when I was a child. Cos I was big and fat and rich and took no shit from anyone. What’s this for?
ANSON
A university paper.
MAGGIE
So they sent me to a convent. Anything you heard about randy nuns, forget it. They have tits like walnuts and leathery little minds. But me, I’m like a great slurpy bag of wet cement waiting to be knocked into shape. Everybody at the convent, they hate me too.
ANSON
You …
MAGGIE
How did I lose it, is that what you want to know?
ANSON
I didn’t … get …
MAGGIE
I lost it to an American airman on top of a tombstone in Worthing cemetery. He was very scared. I was only thirteen and he didn’t want to lose his pilot’s licence. Write this down for Chrissake, it’s good.
LAURA
Oh, yes.
MAGGIE
She was at school with me, you see. We both had it, this English education. Takes a long time to wipe that particular dogshit off your shoe.
ANSON
And Arthur?
MAGGIE
Arthur I meet when I’m seventeen. A case of Trilby. Which is Trilby? I never know.
ARTHUR
The woman is Trilby.
MAGGIE
And the monster is Frankenstein.
ARTHUR
No.
MAGGIE
The doctor is Frankenstein.
ANSON
The monster doesn’t have a name.
LAURA
The man is Svengali.
MAGGIE
Anyway. He invents me.
LAURA
Do you want to change?
MAGGIE
Yeah, I’ll change.
ANSON
Are there … any other singers you greatly admire?
MAGGIE
Well, it’s a funny thing you’ll find … singers mostly admire Billie Holliday, same as jazzmen admire Charlie Parker. Conductors say they admire Toscanini. It’s something to do with how they’re all dead.
ARTHUR
No competition.
MAGGIE
Yes.
ANSON
Among the living?
MAGGIE
This is all real you know, kid. None of the others can say that. Never had a nose-job. Or a face-lift. Or my chin pushed in. Or my jaw straightened. No paraffin wax, no mud-packs. All my own teeth. This is it. The real thing. I am the only girl singer in England not to have been spun out of soya bean.
ANSON
You never seem very happy to have been English. What would you rather have been?
MAGGIE
American.
ANSON
Why?
MAGGIE
America is a crippled giant, England is a sick gnome.
ANSON
No.
MAGGIE
The words and music are Arthur’s but the pain is mine. The pain is real. The quality of the singing depends on the quality of the pain.
ANSON
Oh … medicine.
MAGGIE
Great.
ANSON
Well, yes, in a way except I don’t seem very suited. It’s not my … anyway … I don’t want to bore you with my problems.
MAGGIE
What would you like to be?
ANSON
Well … I don’t know. If I was free …
MAGGIE
Round the back of the Odeon? Yes? After the show? Would you like that?
ANSON
Odeon?
MAGGIE
It’s a figure of speech. Kid.
ARTHUR
You could stand on a beerbox, reach up to her.
LAURA
Shake hands with Saigon Charlie.
MAGGIE
First man I knew played rock music, he was nobody, a real nothing. I say rock music, but really it was all that hoopla and fag dancing the groups used to do. This boy got his big break, bottom of the bill with The Who, national tour. At the end of the tour he came back to Stevenage, he threw it in. I said, you got depressed because they’re so good? He said, I got depressed because they’re so very good and yet even they ask the same questions I do every night
ARTHUR
Yar.
MAGGIE
And I say, sure Jimi, you’re right to complain, people are cunts, but wouldn’t it be a better idea to stop wearing tight trousers and give up clamping your mouth round the strings?
LAURA
I think I’d better keep an eye on Peyote tonight.
MAGGIE
He’ll be OK.
LAURA
He may need looking after.
MAGGIE
If it makes you feel good.
LAURA
What?
MAGGIE
I’d like that hat, Laura. Gonna wear that hat tonight.
ARTHUR
He didn’t say so.
MAGGIE
Well, where’s he gonna put it then?
ARTHUR
Can’t guess.
MAGGIE
Can’t go around with blue balls all night, Laura.
LAURA
I get sentimental about my body, Maggie. Everything else I give to the band, but the body … you know … I still like to choose.
MAGGIE
You couldn’t make her with a monkey wrench. Arthur will tell you all about …
LAURA
End of interview.
MAGGIE
Laura here is my press secretary.
LAURA
End of interview. Anything else you need to know …
MAGGIE
I only sleep with very stupid men. Write this down. The reason I sleep with stupid men is
ANSON
No.
LAURA
Hey, Maggie, the food.
MAGGIE
Not hungry.
LAURA
Just … leave it there will you, Mr Snead?
SNEAD
Madam.
LAURA
And thank you.
ARTHUR
She knows exactly what she’s doing. Always. That’s what I learnt.
LAURA
Yes.
ARTHUR
She knows the effect she’s having. Even when she’s smashed, when she’s flat out on the floor, there is still one circuit in her brain thinking, ‘I am lying here, upsetting people.’
LAURA
Yes.
ARTHUR
There you are.
LAURA
Arthur.
INCH
’As she gone?
ARTHUR
Yes.
INCH
All right everyone, you can come out now.
LAURA
The little fellow with her.
ARTHUR
She swallowed him up like a vacuum cleaner.
INCH
Did she tell the Jimi Hendrix gag?
LAURA
Of course.
INCH
Did she say …
LAURA
Yes, she said it.
INCH
You ’aven’t ’eard it yet.
LAURA
I haven’t heard it but she said it. Just terrible.
NASH
‘I sing of the pain.’
LAURA
She said that.
INCH
‘The pain is real.’
NASH
The pain is bloody real.
INCH
Mostly in the arse.
ARTHUR
All right.
WILSON
Readings from the London telephone directory.
INCH
Oh no.
WILSON
The game is
INCH
No.
WILSON
The game is
ARTHUR
Oh, my God.
WILSON
Arfer, you’ll get yerself disqualified before we begin.
ARTHUR
Is that a …
WILSON
Now, where shall I begin? I think I was jus’ gettin’ inta the Smiths …
SARAFFIAN
Saraffian comes.
ARTHUR
Saraffian. My God.
WILSON
’Ello, Boss.
SARAFFIAN
Loot from the ball, my dears. And twelve bottles of a bleak little non-vintage Dom Perignon. Za za.
INCH
Fantastic.
NASH
Za za.
SARAFFIAN
Just in case we don’t get paid. Wilson, you old dog, I’ve come to show you this … thing.
NASH
Great.
SARAFFIAN
Beautiful, isn’t it? I’m really proud. He’s going to wipe up the queer market, no question.
RANDOLPH
I …
SARAFFIAN
Uh, don’t risk it, just don’t spoil it, lad. Don’t mess with the words, OK? Don’t risk them, they only get you into trouble.
RANDOLPH
Pl …
SARAFFIAN
He wants to protest his heterosexuality. Just don’t mention it, underplay it and we might believe in it. Might.
LAURA
Saraffian.
SARAFFIAN
My dear.
LAURA
What are you up to?
SARAFFIAN
Come to hear the band.
LAURA
I’ve been trying to ring you these last few days.
SARAFFIAN
Ah.
LAURA
Have you seen her?
PEYOTE
The sun goin’ da’an. A tha’asand golden chariots. Leather. Metal. Horseflesh. Careerin’ da’an through the sky.
LAURA
Have you seen her?
SARAFFIAN
Well …
WILSON
Did you ’ear the first set?
SARAFFIAN
Certainly I heard it. I heard it all. From beginning to end. And I’m hoping it will have earned me some small remission in hell. Look lively, open the bottles, son.
LAURA
When are you going to talk to her?
SARAFFIAN
Well, this is nice. Peyote, I saw your old woman last night. Would you believe it, she has another husband, she’s still only nineteen.
WILSON
Wot’s ’e like?
SARAFFIAN
Very charming. Easy-going bloke. Nose-flute player in a monastery band.
LAURA
She’s not very well, Saraffian.
NASH
Let’s ’avva game.
SARAFFIAN
Snap.
WILSON
Poker.
NASH
Monopoly.
WILSON
Lost the board.
LAURA
Saraffian.
WILSON
And Peyote swallowed the boot.
SARAFFIAN
Poker.
LAURA
And she’s drinking again.
SARAFFIAN
Yes.
LAURA
Arthur, will you tell him?
ARTHUR
I …
LAURA
Why do you think she drinks?
SARAFFIAN
I never ask, in my profession you expect to spend a portion of your time sitting by a hospital bed …
LAURA
Listen …
SARAFFIAN
I’ve got very good at it. I think the ultimate accolade of my profession should not be a disc, it should be a golden hypodermic.
LAURA
Saraffian.
SARAFFIAN
What is this? I pay a courtesy call on one of my bands …
LAURA
Don’t be stupid. Courtesy call. When did you last see a band on the road?
SARAFFIAN
Glenn Miller, I think.
LAURA
Saraffian, why does she drink?
SARAFFIAN
Why do we discuss her all the time? That’s why she drinks. So we’ll discuss her. You know, so we won’t have time to do things like cut our fingernails or make love to our wives. That’s why she drinks. So as to stop any nasty little outbreaks of happiness among her acquaintances. Are there any glasses for this stuff?
LAURA
So tell me why you thought Arthur should come.
SARAFFIAN
Kid.
ARTHUR
Please.
LAURA
Why does he have to come and see her again, it only screws her up.
SARAFFIAN
Please leave it, Laura, there are no answers and there is absolutely no point in the questions.
LAURA
I see. Can I say anything at all?
SARAFFIAN
No.
LAURA
Can anyone say anything?
SARAFFIAN
No.
LAURA
Don’t crawl up my arse, Saraffian, what is Arthur doing here?
SARAFFIAN
He …
ARTHUR
I wanted to come.
LAURA
What?
SARAFFIAN
He wanted to see her.
LAURA
Arthur?
SARAFFIAN
His own idea.
ARTHUR
Yes. Just to see her for Chrissake. I wanted to see her. Is that … just to see her.
SARAFFIAN
Everyone should love everyone. Take the global view, Laura, please. Champagne.
LAURA
Listen …
SARAFFIAN
Shit, Laura, a man can love two women at once. I’ve seen it done. The human heart. Shall we ever understand it, Tone?
RANDOLPH
I …
SARAFFIAN
The answer is no. The boy adored her. Now he feels responsible. So.
WILSON
And …
LAURA
Well …
INCH
There.
SARAFFIAN
Look at it this way, Laura. I knew a Viennese teacher who said that desperate people who try to kill themselves but only succeed in shooting their eyes out, never, ever attempt suicide again. It’s the sense of challenge you see. Once you’ve lost your eyes, it gives you something to live for.
PEYOTE
Dubbin. Brass. Bells.
NASH
Wot’s up wi’ ’im?
PEYOTE
Streakin’ through the sky. The ’ouse’old cavalry itself.
WILSON
’E’s on ’orses again.
PEYOTE
Pomades. The royal ’orses.
WILSON
Said in the paper seventy per cent of adult males dream regularly of fuckin’ Princess Anne.
INCH
Quite right. I mean, what’s a royal family for if not to …
WILSON
… dream.
PEYOTE
An’ a cry of ’allelujah.
LAURA
It’s just possible anywhere, any time to decide to be a tragic figure. It’s just an absolute determination to go down. The reasons are arbitrary, it may almost be pride, just not wanting to be like everyone else. I think you can die to avoid cliché. And you can let people die to avoid cliché.
SARAFFIAN
Quite.
WILSON
Shall we play the telephone game?
SARAFFIAN
I can’t tell you the beauty of this profession. Years ago when I was young. It was full of people called Nat and Harry and Dick in brown suits and two-tone shoes. With thick chunky jewellery as if someone had splattered hot melting gold over their bodies with a watering can, and it had set in great thick blobs. And golden discs on the walls. And heavy presentation ballpoint sets, on their desks. Would sell you their grandmother’s wooden leg. Nat did sell his grandmother’s wooden leg, after she died, admittedly. And they muttered the totem phrases of the trade like, ‘Tell him I’ll get back to him.’ There was no higher compliment an initiate could be paid than to be taken out for pickled brisket and beetroot borscht and be told in perfect confidence, ‘The real dough’s in sheet music. My son.’ And they snapped great white fingers round the piano and used words like ‘catchy’ and ‘wild’. And the artists … the artists bore no connection to the world I knew. When Nat travelled he carried them in the back of the van with a sliding glass compartment between him and them so he wouldn’t have to listen to their conversation. He talked about installing sprinklers, as in Buchenwald. It was organized crime. Really. Those days. That’s what interested me. The blatancy of it. The damnfool screaming stupidity of popular music. I loved it.
LAURA
Where the people?
MAGGIE
In the dinner tent.
LAURA
Ah.
MAGGIE
They’re having dinner. In the dinner tent.
LAURA
You ought to … put this on. The other’s got dirty.
MAGGIE
Laura.
LAURA
Yeah.
MAGGIE
The boy, the student …
LAURA
Yes, I can imagine.
MAGGIE
The journalist.
LAURA
Yes, yes, I know who you mean.
MAGGIE
He was in a bit of a state, I couldn’t believe it. I think he must have juiced himself up.
LAURA
Yes.
MAGGIE
He said your thighs are so beautiful, your thighs are so beautiful, well, Laura, you seen my thighs …
LAURA
Yes.
MAGGIE
I said please let’s not … I’d rather you just …
LAURA
You better go on.
MAGGIE
He said your body is like a book in which men may read strange things, a foreign country in which they may travel with delight. Your cheeks like damask, the soft white loveliness of your breasts, leading to the firm dark mountain peaks of your, Laura, now I am dreading which part of my body he will choose next on which to turn the great white beam of his fucking sincerity. Between your legs the silver comets spiral through the night, I lose myself, he says … he says … how beautiful you are Maggie and how beautiful life ought to be with you.
LAURA
Don’t.
MAGGIE
So. I don’t want to know.
LAURA
No.
MAGGIE
Then eventually … I say please, faking. He says yes of course, he stops talking. We wait. For thirty minutes. For thirty minutes it is like trying to push a marshmallow into a coinbox.
MAGGIE
Where’s Arthur? God, how I used to love that man.
LAURA
Yeah.
MAGGIE
He used to make me feel good, you know, he made me want to curl up foetal.
LAURA
Across the way they … talking about you.
MAGGIE
I’m a Zeppelin. I’m fifty foot up.
LAURA
Saraffian’s here.
MAGGIE
No kid.
LAURA
That’s right.
MAGGIE
Why’d he come tonight?
LAURA
I don’t know.
MAGGIE
Bum set. Bum gig. Think he noticed?
LAURA
Arthur has travelled quite a long way.
MAGGIE
Yeah.
LAURA
Say seventy miles. I think he’s entitled to a little of your time. If you can fit him in between …
MAGGIE
Do you know Arthur was a good man? When we first met? Really good man. He used to leave half-finished joints in telephone booths just so passers-by could have a good time.
LAURA
Listen …
MAGGIE
But he’s become a little over-earnest for me, don’t you think? I mean, if there was going to be a revolution it would have happened by now. I don’t think 1970’ll be the big year. I mean the real revolution will have to be …
LAURA
Inside?
MAGGIE
Gimme the bottle.
LAURA
Why do you talk like that, Maggie?
MAGGIE
Gimme the bottle.
LAURA
Where does that stupid half-baked bullshit come from?
MAGGIE
Well …
LAURA
If you really wanted rid of him you wouldn’t sing his songs. And you wouldn’t be afraid to tell him to his face.
MAGGIE
All my life I’ve noticed people in telephone booths, in restaurants, heads down, saying things like, ‘I don’t want to see you again.’ Once you start looking, they’re everywhere. People rushing out of rooms, asking each other to lower their voices, while they say, ‘You’ve got to choose between her and me.’ Or, ‘Don’t write me, don’t phone me, I just don’t want to see you again.’ People bent over crawling into corners at parties, sweating away to have weasely tearful little chats about human relationships. God how I hate all that. It seems so clear. I’ve finished with Arthur. And I’m fed up with his songs. I’m resentful and jealous and I want to be left alone. And I don’t want to look in his lame doggy eyes.
LAURA
They’re coming back.
MAGGIE
Look at carrot-top over there.
LAURA
Must be almost time.
MAGGIE
Look, he’s laughing.
LAURA
And his hand’s coming up. Look …
MAGGIE
Yes.
LAURA
No, she’s wriggled out of it.
MAGGIE
She’s saying something.
LAURA
I think his name’s Rodney.
MAGGIE
What did she say?
LAURA
Dunno. Something like don’t touch me, Rodney.
MAGGIE
Christ, look at him.
LAURA
He’s taking it badly.
MAGGIE
They’re funny the rich …
LAURA
He’s standing there gasping.
MAGGIE
They do it all so slowly.
LAURA
Like someone hit him with a cricket bat. He’s …
INCH
You can’t ’elp wonderin’ … wot a bomb would do.
SARAFFIAN
Hallo, my dear.
CONGA

MAGGIE
Saraffian. Come to check on your investment?
SARAFFIAN
That’s right.
MAGGIE
Just merchandise to you.
SARAFFIAN
Sure are.
MAGGIE
We could be anything. Soapflakes we could be. Well, that’s fine. Yes. That’s fine by all of us. Yes, Arthur?
ARTHUR
I don’t know. It’s not so easy of course. I believe the acid dream is over, it said in the Daily Express.  But you and I, Maggie … we still want to say something. Yes?
MAGGIE
Love you. Where my shoes?
SARAFFIAN
At the present rate if you lot go on working for another three years, you’ll just about cover the advance I gave you.
ARTHUR
Leonardo da Vinci drew submarines. Five hundred years ago. They looked pretty silly. Today we are drawing a new man. He may look pretty silly.
MAGGIE
You still want it to mean something, don’t you? You can’t get over that, can you? It’s all gotta mean something … that’s childish, Arthur. It don’t mean anything.
LAURA
Do you want the flowers?
MAGGIE
Fuck the flowers.
ARTHUR
Haven’t I seen Randolph before?
SARAFFIAN
Used to be a drummer. Year or two ago. Used to lay down a beat for Eve Boswell.
ARTHUR
Eve Boswell?
SARAFFIAN
Well, he is nearly thirty-five you know. They all come round. It all comes round again.
RANDOLPH
Tony Torrent.
SARAFFIAN
Right. It never got better you know. It’ll never get better than 1956. Tat. Utter tat. But inspired. The obvious repeated many times. Simple things said well. Then along came those boys who could really play. They spoilt it of course. Ruined it. They were far too good. Before that … very fine my dears.
MAGGIE
Saraffian.
SARAFFIAN
Yes.
MAGGIE
Shut up.
SARAFFIAN
Rock me baby till my back ain’t got no bone.
MAGGIE
Just try and forget, eh? Forget who you are. Don’t think about it. Pack your personality under your arm an’ have a good time. I really mean it.
WILSON
Get on with it.
MAGGIE
Wilson here … this is Wilson … on keyboard. Wilson has always entertained the notion of taking his trousers down. On account of the pain. So let’s have them, Wilson.
INCH
Come on, come on now.
MAGGIE
Ladies an’ genel’men …
ARTHUR
Great stuff.
SARAFFIAN
Really terrific.
ARTHUR
Where is she?
SARAFFIAN
Getting her head kicked in.
LAURA
Didn’t get us very far.
WILSON
My jeans.
LAURA
Where did she get to?
WILSON
My beautiful jeans.
SARAFFIAN
Winner of the 1969 Judy Garland award for boring boring boring …
INCH
Wot the fuck was that about?
WILSON
Somethin’ to do with the pain.
INCH
Wot pain?
LAURA
Go and get a shower ready.
INCH
Wot fuckin’ pain?
SARAFFIAN
The pain, you know, the pain that makes her such a great artist.
INCH
I’m not washin’ ’er again.
LAURA
Put her down.
NASH
Anyone want ’er?
INCH
Will somebody tell me wot fuckin’ pain?
WILSON
The pain.
INCH
It’s meant to be somethin’ ta do with the pain. But wot pain? She can’t even remember wot it was ’erself. Somethin’ ta do with ’er upbringin’. Well, my upbringin’ was three in bed and jam if yer lucky on Sundays, but I rub along. Somethin’ ta do with bein’ unloved, but she don’ wanta be loved, she wants to be flattened by a Sherman tank.
ARTHUR
Leave it alone.
INCH
Of course, bloody Arthur thinks it’s wonderful.
LAURA
Tell her now.
SARAFFIAN
What?
LAURA
Tell her, for God’s sake, get it over with. It can’t get worse. She’ll understand, she’ll pretend not to, but get it over with.
INCH
Wot a cow.
SARAFFIAN
Shut up.
LAURA
She’s listening.
SARAFFIAN
Some pressure building up, my dear, amongst us all. The boy …
ARTHUR
I …
SARAFFIAN
Shut up. In his stumbling way. I, in mine. The band, all in theirs. Arthur would like to be free of you. He would like to set up a home with Laura. Yes. And you’re sacked.
SNEAD
This is a raid. You’re all busted.
ARTHUR

AND ALL IT KNOWS IS THAT ONE WORD
rejoice.
ANSON
I saw the second set. She rather … pushed the boat out, I thought.
ARTHUR
Yes.
ANSON
I saw the police about.
ARTHUR
We were busted.
ANSON
Gosh, I’m sorry.
ARTHUR
Mmm.
ANSON
That’s terrible. Vicious.
ARTHUR
Vicious.
ANSON
Terrible.
ARTHUR
What’s everyone doing?
ANSON
Who?
ARTHUR
Everyone.
ANSON
Oh, you mean the revellers.
ARTHUR
Yes.
ANSON
They’ve scattered. It rather loses its focus, you know. Till the champagne breakfast. It’s … all over the place. The dinner tent’s a disco and … they’ve got a Deanna Durbin in the buttery.
ARTHUR
Of course.
ANSON
I did have a partner, you know.
ARTHUR
Yes.
ANSON
I rather lost track of her, I’m sure she’s …
ARTHUR
Yes.
ANSON
You were at this college?
ARTHUR
I read music.
ANSON
What happened?
ARTHUR
I met Maggie. It seemed academic just to go on reading it.
ANSON
Yes.
ARTHUR
At the time troubadour was the fashionable profession. It was also very good fun.
ANSON
I don’t like it very much.
ARTHUR
The people don’t seem to have changed.
ANSON
Oh, I don’t know. There are a few more totallys, you know. I should think. I share digs with a totally. I mean, I call him a totally, what happens is he has his friends to tea, I never stay, I just occasionally have to let them in the door and I overhear them, they’re always sitting there saying, ‘The whole system’s totally corrupt an’s gotta be totally replaced by a totally new system’, so I just stand at the door and say, ‘Couple more totallys for you, Tom.’
ARTHUR
Hallo, Peyote.
PEYOTE
If ya ’appen to see a chick wiv jus’ a pair o’ jeans an’ a leather waistcoat, say ’ello from Peyote, will ya?
ARTHUR
Sure thing.
ANSON
I’m hoping to drop out, you know. When I get my degree. I just want to groove.
ARTHUR
Course you do. But it’s not so easy is it? I mean, the rules are so complicated, it’s like three-dimensional chess.
ANSON
Yes.
ARTHUR
Just … work at it, eh?
INCH
’Allo, Arfer.
ARTHUR
How they doing?
INCH
Still doin’ the interviews.
ARTHUR
What have they found?
INCH
I don’t know. I think Peyote swallowed a certain amount of the evidence. ’E’s very quick.
ANSON
I wonder …
ARTHUR
Where you off to?
INCH
Look for some crumpet.
ARTHUR
Can I come with you?
INCH
You’d cramp me, Arfer. Somewhere in that tent is my ideal.
ARTHUR
What’s that?
INCH
A short dirty-minded blonde.
ANSON
I’ve got a finger in my pocket.
ARTHUR
Ah.
ANSON
You know I’m a medical student?
ARTHUR
Yes.
ANSON
Can I show it to you? I think it’s rather a good joke. Handshake, you know, and one drops off.
ARTHUR
Yes. Yes.
SARAFFIAN
Here we are, lads. Za za. Small advance. In lieu of. It’s ten grand to a spent rubber we don’t get paid.
ARTHUR
You must be mad, the police are everywhere.
SARAFFIAN
Well?
ARTHUR
Here, you can guard your own loot now.
SARAFFIAN
What did they say to you?
SMEGS
Same as everyone. Name and address and not to leave the area.
SARAFFIAN
Do you know what they found?
SMEGS
Apparently the Alsatian went berserk. It found so much stuff its eyes kept crossing and its knees caved in.
SARAFFIAN
Where’s Nash?
SMEGS
Gone for a smoke in the bog. Said he needed a joint to calm himself down.
SARAFFIAN
Ta.
ARTHUR
And Maggie?
SARAFFIAN
They can’t find her. Disappeared. Don’t say ‘oh God’, that’s what she wants you to say. That’s what you’re programmed to say, Arthur.
ARTHUR
Where is she?
SARAFFIAN
After the bust she just slipped off …
ARTHUR
Saraffian.
SARAFFIAN
Listen. She is sacked. Keep your nerve. Arthur.
RANDOLPH
Guv, can I …
SARAFFIAN
Here’s something. Look. You have to get the little ball in the hole.
RANDOLPH
Right.
ARTHUR
Do you know how Saraffian made his money?
SMEGS
Not us.
ARTHUR
No, real money.
SARAFFIAN
Go on.
ARTHUR
He used to wait for some black group to do well in the States, you know like the Temptations, then he says he’s bringing them over. Sell out, of course. Except when they arrive they aren’t quite the same people they are in the States. They’re just five guys he’s met in a bar.
SARAFFIAN
This is true.
ARTHUR
Who he calls the Fabulous Temptations, then teaches them the songs the real group plays.
SARAFFIAN
I’ve brought over some great sounds this way.
ARTHUR
And in England nobody knows the difference.
SARAFFIAN
Seeing how they’re black.
ARTHUR
Yeah, you wouldn’t try it with the Beach Boys, would you?
SARAFFIAN
Well, one or two cheap tricks it’s true. People expect it. The odd artist hung upside down from a third-floor window. It’s part of the show.
ARTHUR
No doubt.
SARAFFIAN
And Arthur feels strongly that …
ARTHUR
All right.
SARAFFIAN
No, come on, you feel strongly that …
ARTHUR
It’s not worth saying. Nothing’s worth saying. It’s all so obvious.
SMEGS
Anyone got a fag?
ANSON
Gertrude Stein never put her car in reverse.
ARTHUR
Yes, there is the inkling of an objection, just a smudge, perhaps the feeling Al Capone might greet you in the street.
SARAFFIAN
I told you.
ARTHUR
Of course, it’s a big organization, fair number of clients, so if some junior oddball wants to drive her band until they’re catatonic with fatigue, with pills, with petrol fumes, well, at least that is her taken care of, until you choose to flick her off your balance sheet.
WILSON
Wot’s ’appenin’?
SMEGS
Cambridge Union Debate.
WILSON
Oh. Wot’s the subject?
ARTHUR
Ethics.
WILSON
County Championship?
SMEGS
No, no, not Ethex like Thuthex, ethics like – what you’re meant to do.
ARTHUR
I’m going to go and find her. Take this.
ANSON
It’s my finger.
SARAFFIAN
Course it is, lad.
ANSON
I get screwed up you know. If you can imagine my life.
SARAFFIAN
Mmm.
ANSON
I just long to get away. Join a band. On the road. Eh? I wouldn’t mind how menial … anything. It’s just every day here I know what the next day will be like. Isn’t that dreadful? Going to lectures. Work in the lab. And all the time I want my mind to float free. I want it above me like a kite, and instead it’s … why have I no friends? And why does nobody talk to me?
WILSON
Bloody ’ellfire.
SARAFFIAN
Well.
WILSON
Never go to the piss’ouse wiv that one, ’e’d chop it off soon as look at yer.
SARAFFIAN
He’s just lonely.
WILSON
Wot else ’as ’e got in ’is pocket, bits of old toe ’n’ little chunks of earlobe?
SARAFFIAN
He’s trying to be interesting, you know. Have some character. The man who goes round with a finger in his pocket. Very casual, very interesting. Rather dark. He just wants to be liked.
WILSON
You know the real killers?
SARAFFIAN
Yes.
WILSON
The ones who jus’ wanna be liked.
ARTHUR
Where is she? She’s not in the tent.
SARAFFIAN
Nobody knows.
WILSON
‘Where is she, wot is she on?’
ARTHUR
Where is she?
SARAFFIAN
Look in the common room. Or the cricket pavilion. She might be there. But don’t let her know you’re looking.
SMEGS
Yeah.
WILSON
Let’s ’avva look at that.
SMEGS
How long till we play?
SARAFFIAN
The first day they met he drove her to the north of Scotland. The northern sky was wide and open so that strange Hebridean light came through white blinds on to their bed in a perfect square. A perfect white square in a dark hotel room. And they felt that first night they were almost not in the world at all.
SMEGS
How do you know?
SARAFFIAN
Oh, she used to tell you.
SMEGS
Why?
SARAFFIAN
To make you think it didn’t matter to her. That’s why she told you. As a hedge against disaster. Like her whole life.
SMEGS
What gets me is, it’s her we talk about all the time, but it’s Peyote’ll actually kill himself.
LAURA
Has anyone seen Arthur?
SARAFFIAN
Oh jeepers.
WILSON
Where is ’e? Wot is ’e on?
LAURA
I just wondered if anyone had seen him.
SMEGS
The footsteps go from left to right. Stop there briefly. Then we say …
SARAFFIAN
Try the common room.
SMEGS
Or the cricket pavilion.
SARAFFIAN
But don’t let him know you’re looking.
SMEGS
You look puzzled and depart.
LAURA
What?
SMEGS
Next.
WILSON
Laura. Jus’ let me show you somethin’.
LAURA
Wilson …
WILSON
Whoops, there it goes again.
LAURA
Very funny.
WILSON
Laura, I promise to concentrate next time.
SARAFFIAN
Where did you stash it?
SMEGS
What?
SARAFFIAN
The stuff.
WILSON
Oh, we only ’ad some giggle-weed, it ’ad nearly all gone.
SMEGS
Shouldn’t we talk about the future of the band?
WILSON
Yeah.
SMEGS
Do something different, what do you think?
WILSON
I’d like to do some songs about Jesus Christ.
SMEGS
Wilson, he’s been done to death.
WILSON
Ah – ’is own complaint exactly.
SARAFFIAN
And who carried the rest, the hard stuff, who carried that?
WILSON
Well …
SARAFFIAN
Did she know?
WILSON
She ’ad a carpetbag. It’s only Peyote. ’E used to …
SARAFFIAN
Did she know?
WILSON
Yes.
SARAFFIAN
You think the police are going to believe that?
WILSON
It’s true.
SARAFFIAN
Of course it’s true, that’s not the point. The point is, who gets to go to jail.
PEYOTE
I jus’ bin propositioned by the rowing eight.
WILSON
Wot did you tell them?
PEYOTE
I told ’em I wasn’t that sort of girl.
SARAFFIAN
Listen, Peyote, you’re going to have to come with me to the police, you’re going to have to tell them about this bag …
PEYOTE
I said I’d smash a bottle in their face.
WILSON
Never works that. I never believe it when they do it in the films …
PEYOTE
Jus’ who the hell do they think I am?
SARAFFIAN
Yes, Peyote.
PEYOTE
I’m not anybody’s.
SARAFFIAN
No, Peyote.
PEYOTE
I’d rather busk, I’d rather play free gigs, I’d rather busk in the foyers of VD clinics than play to these cunts.
SARAFFIAN
Yes.
WILSON
It’s pointless.
PEYOTE
An’ they’ve ruffled my fuckin’ wig.
WILSON
It’s pointless. You’ll never get through to him now.
SARAFFIAN
All right everyone. Find the girl.
SARAFFIAN
Looking for you. Everyone. Everywhere.
MAGGIE
In the library.
SARAFFIAN
Didn’t think of that. There are some things you should be told.
MAGGIE
Thoughts of St Ignatius. Look. Pretty thin, eh?
SARAFFIAN
Yeah.
MAGGIE
Poor value. Just whatever came off the top of his head.
SARAFFIAN
Maggie … there’s a problem with the bust …
MAGGIE
And I got you a trinket.
SARAFFIAN
Thank you.
MAGGIE
You can melt it down.
SARAFFIAN
I will.
MAGGIE
And pour it down your throat.
SARAFFIAN
Maggie …
MAGGIE
You really got me Saraffian.
SARAFFIAN
I know.
MAGGIE
You did well.
SARAFFIAN
The timing …
MAGGIE
I was going to quit.
SARAFFIAN
I’m sure. But I sacked you first.
MAGGIE
Not in my overself.
SARAFFIAN
What does your overself say?
MAGGIE
My overself says
SARAFFIAN
Maggie about the bust …
MAGGIE
Why are girls who fuck around said to be tragic whereas guys who sleep about are the leaders of the pack?
SARAFFIAN
Why do people drink?
MAGGIE
Can’t stand it?
SARAFFIAN
Wrong. Need an excuse.
MAGGIE
Ah.
SARAFFIAN
They want to be addicted so’s to have something to blame. It’s not me speaking. It’s the drink. The drugs. It’s not me can’t manage. They want to be invaded, so there’s an excuse. So there’s a bit intact.
MAGGIE
I’ve never been addicted.
SARAFFIAN
No?
MAGGIE
This goes through me like a gutter. Even on heroin I knew I could beat it. I did beat it. There’s something in me that won’t lie down.
SARAFFIAN
Oh yes.
MAGGIE
Struggling along on two personalities. I have seventeen, I have twenty-one.
SARAFFIAN
Like everyone else.
MAGGIE
Do you know the purpose of reincarnation?
SARAFFIAN
Not exactly.
MAGGIE
You get sent back because you failed last time.
SARAFFIAN
I see.
MAGGIE
I believe all we’re doing here is trying to avoid coming back. I think you get sent back because you didn’t get it right last time. Basically. You got sent back for having blown it the time before. Well, this time … I’m not coming back.
SARAFFIAN
Ah.
MAGGIE
I could get you through the Sinai desert, no map, no compass. I’d know. Just like that.
SARAFFIAN
Really?
MAGGIE
Why don’t people take more care of their overselves? They just rub them in the mud.
SARAFFIAN
Yes.
MAGGIE
Why is that?
SARAFFIAN
It’s a failing people have.
MAGGIE
You don’t believe a single word I say.
SARAFFIAN
No. Nor do you.
MAGGIE
Con safos.
SARAFFIAN
You never would.
MAGGIE
Well, what am I going to do tomorrow? Tonight?
SARAFFIAN
I thought you had the little fellow …
MAGGIE
Don’t patronize me, Saraffian.
SARAFFIAN
… the finger freak. What happened to him?
MAGGIE
I don’t know. I gave him some acid, told him to get high.
SARAFFIAN
How did you get it?
MAGGIE
What?
SARAFFIAN
The acid.
MAGGIE
Oh, some creep. Liked the way I sang.
SARAFFIAN
Have the police talked to you?
MAGGIE
I’m OK. Don’t worry. I’m cool. This is legal and it’s all I’ve got.
SARAFFIAN
Maggie.
MAGGIE
You’re not my manager now.
SARAFFIAN
No.
MAGGIE
Do you know why I liked you as my manager?
SARAFFIAN
I have a fairly shrewd idea.
MAGGIE
Because you were such an unspeakable shit.
SARAFFIAN
That’s right. I was aware of that. You’d say to people, I’d love to do your charity gig, play free in the streets of Glasgow, great but – er – that bastard Saraffian would just never let me. And everyone says, poor girl.
MAGGIE
You’re right.
SARAFFIAN
I know. That’s why everyone likes to be handled by me. I’m an excuse. Any artist stands next to me looks like a saint. Canonization. Cheap at twenty per cent.
MAGGIE
Then why did you like me?
SARAFFIAN
I don’t know. Two-bit band, one of five hundred, fifteen hundred. Your tunes were better and the singer had balls. But where did I get you? One week in the Melody Maker at number eighty-four. And what’s called a minor cult. I’d rather have leprosy than a minor cult. You know, some booking manager rings you, says what’ve you got? I say Maggie Frisby’s lot, he says, no no, I never take minor cults. You have it round your neck in letters of stone.
MAGGIE
So what happened?
SARAFFIAN
Well. What happens to everyone? Bands just break up. Travel too much. Drop too much acid. Fifty-seven varieties of clap. Become too successful – never your problem, my dear – they break up because they don’t feel any need. I don’t mean fame, that’s boring, or money, that’s a cliché, of course it goes without saying that money will separate you from the things you want to sing about, we all know that. I mean – need. Maggie. Where’s the need?
MAGGIE
I don’t know. What do you think?
SARAFFIAN
I don’t know. I don’t sing.
MAGGIE
It’s nothing to do with singing.
SARAFFIAN
No?
MAGGIE
Oh, come on, it’s nothing to do with being an artist, artists are just like everyone else …
SARAFFIAN
Then what …
MAGGIE
I have this sense of arbitrariness you know. Like it was Arthur but it could have been one of ten thousand others.
SARAFFIAN
Just …
MAGGIE
Where did we get this idea that one human being’s more interesting than another?
SARAFFIAN
Maggie.
MAGGIE
Great help in career at time most needed. Never forgotten. Farewell.
SARAFFIAN
Maggie. The band didn’t get around to telling you. They stashed all their stuff in your bag. That means the bust sort of settles on you.
MAGGIE
OK. Try prison for a while, why not?
SARAFFIAN
Ah. Is that all right?
MAGGIE
No.
SARAFFIAN
You know …
MAGGIE
Yes.
SARAFFIAN
Long books about Thalberg and Louis B. Mayer. Who laid the ice cubes on Jean Harlow’s nipples? But nobody notices they’re living through something just as rich, just as lovely. And in thirty years’ time they’ll write books about the record business of the fifties or sixties. What it was like to have known Jerry Wexler. Or glimpse Chuck Berry at the other end of the room.
MAGGIE
You think?
SARAFFIAN
I’m banking on it. If I’m to have had any life at all. It’s going to look so special. Once it’s over, of course.
INCH
Upper-class cunt, it’s in a world of its own. Smell my fingers.
SARAFFIAN
Thank you, no.
INCH
Dab some be’ind yer ears.
SARAFFIAN
Inch …
INCH
Now I’m ’ungry.
SARAFFIAN
They should invent a machine.
INCH
Wot?
SARAFFIAN
Gratify all your senses at once.
INCH
Well, I did know someone used to eat Complan sittin’ on the can. ’E was into ’is ’ead, you see, despised the body, so ’e reckoned it best to sit shovellin’ it in at one end and pushin’ it out at the other, an’ that way get the ’ole job over with. Now I reckon if ’e coulda jus’ spared ’is left ’and as well . .
SARAFFIAN
Quite.
INCH
Do the lot in one go.
SARAFFIAN
Yes. The rest of us, well, we spread our pleasures so thin.
LAURA
What’s happening?
SARAFFIAN
Did you find him?
LAURA
No. Is she all right?
SARAFFIAN
Yes. Get ready for the third set.
LAURA
It’s cancelled. There are notices all over saying it’s cancelled by popular demand.
INCH
Great.
SARAFFIAN
I knew it. It’s in the contract. Three sets or we don’t get paid.
LAURA
So what do we do?
SARAFFIAN
Play it. Just play it, it’s our only chance of the cash. I don’t care if nobody’s listening. Why don’t you round up the band?
LAURA
It’s not my job.
INCH
I’m ’avin’ me tea.
SARAFFIAN
Laura. Please.
PEYOTE
’Ere we are.
INCH
That’s not ours.
PEYOTE
Saraffian said nick somethin’‚ I nicked somethin’.
INCH
We can’t nick that, we can’t get it in the van.
PEYOTE
Let’s ’ave a ball of our own.
WILSON
Did yer talk to the pigs?
PEYOTE
Let’s ’ave a party.
LAURA
Right. Is everyone ready?
WILSON
’Ow yer feelin’, Peyote?
PEYOTE
Fantastic. Let’s ’avva party.
LAURA
It’s three-thirty, let’s just play the …
WILSON
’E’s right back up there, ’ow does ’e do it?
PEYOTE
Listen, mate, if you’d dropped as much stuff as me . .
SMEGS
It always comes back to this.
PEYOTE
You lot’ll never understand …
SMEGS
If there’s one thing I really despise it’s psychedelic chauvinism …
PEYOTE
I want some fun.
SMEGS
‘I’ve had more trips than you.’
PEYOTE
Fun.
INCH
If you like I can …
WILSON
Wot?
INCH
Set light to my fart.
NASH
Oh no.
WILSON
Not again.
NASH
We’ve seen it.
WILSON
Dozens of times.
SMEGS
One streak of blue flame and it’s over.
WILSON
Can’t you do anything else?
INCH
Yeah. I do bird impressions.
SMEGS
Really?
INCH
Yeah. I eat worms.
SARAFFIAN
Right. Look lively, everyone. Third set. Any ideas? Requests?
WILSON
I would like to ’ear Richard Tauber sing ‘Yew Are My ’eart’s Desire’.
NASH
Wot is this?
SMEGS
Get in a line.
PEYOTE
Let’s get on with it …
SARAFFIAN
This is the third set.
PEYOTE
I’m gonna need a fuck in about forty-five seconds.
NASH
Did you take sweeties again?
RANDOLPH
Guv, this little ball it just won’t go in . .
SARAFFIAN
Keep trying.
NASH
Who’s the vocals?
SARAFFIAN
Just stay in a line.
PEYOTE
I’m not gonna last.
WILSON
Listen, we gotta ’ave real vocals.
SARAFFIAN
Tony. Sing with the band.
RANDOLPH
But I gotta try and …
SARAFFIAN
You may stop. You may sing with the band.
RANDOLPH
Wot key are we in?
SARAFFIAN
All right. Hold it. There’s no one to witness the third set took place. We need that little bloke. The one that booked us.
WILSON
The one wiv the finger.
SARAFFIAN
Yes.
WILSON
You won’t find ’im. Some cretin gave ’im some acid. They took ’im to ’ospital. Stupid little shit.
SARAFFIAN
Oh dear.
LAURA
What happens next?
SARAFFIAN
Just let me think …
LAURA
What about …
SARAFFIAN
Tony, ring Mrs Saraffian, say I’m not going to get back tonight so she’s to change the budgie’s sandpaper, OK?
RANDOLPH
Will do.
PEYOTE
Are we gonna do this or are we not?
NASH
I’m beginnin’ to feel jus’ a bit of a fool.
WILSON
You think there’d be somebody. Wouldn’t you? Don’t you think? Jus’ somebody to hear us? Wouldn’t you think?
ARTHUR
What the hell is going on?
SARAFFIAN
Arthur …
ARTHUR
I just talked to the police.
SARAFFIAN
Don’t worry, everything’s in hand …
ARTHUR
They seem to think Maggie was pushing the stuff.
SARAFFIAN
That’s right.
ARTHUR
Well, who the hell put the stuff in her bag?
PEYOTE
I think I’ll jus’ phase out, you know …
ARTHUR
He knows bloody well what’s going on.
PEYOTE
Jus’ go and get laid.
ARTHUR
He’s a bit fucking selective about what he blocks out.
PEYOTE
Well.
SARAFFIAN
Arthur …
ARTHUR
Did you tell Maggie?
SARAFFIAN
Yes.
ARTHUR
Does she know she’s going to get done?
SARAFFIAN
Oh yes.
ARTHUR
Well, what does she say?
SARAFFIAN
Well … to be honest … she doesn’t seem to mind.
RANDOLPH
You better come quick. She’s burning down the tent.
ARTHUR
Maggie. Maggie. Are you there?
MAGGIE
Arthur.
ARTHUR
Ah.
MAGGIE
I’m here. I’m naked and I’m covered in coconut oil.
ARTHUR
Oh fuck, what was that?
MAGGIE
It’s a rugby post.
ARTHUR
You’ve done pretty well.
MAGGIE
Thank you very much.
ARTHUR
Yip. Police. Ambulance. Fire brigade. You just got to score the air-sea rescue service and you got a full house.
MAGGIE
Thank you. What’s the damage?
ARTHUR
Not bad.
MAGGIE
I can’t see any flame.
ARTHUR
No, no, they’re all coping rather well. They all love it you know. Dashing about in the smoke. They’re hoping to make it an annual event.
MAGGIE
Really?
ARTHUR
Bit of fun.
MAGGIE
All right.
ARTHUR
Haven’t seen you for a long time. Must be six months. What have you been up to?
MAGGIE
Nothing really. I had the flu.
ARTHUR
What else?
MAGGIE
Do you have some cigarettes?
ARTHUR
Sure.
MAGGIE
Can you give me the pack? It’s just if I’m gonna be arrested I’m gonna need some.
ARTHUR
Of course. Here.
MAGGIE
Thank you.
ARTHUR
What were you doing?
MAGGIE
What?
ARTHUR
The tent. Just making sure?
MAGGIE
Oh yes. Just making sure.
ARTHUR
I can get you a lawyer.
MAGGIE
Don’t be stupid. What else?
ARTHUR
Oh, you know. Larry says, come and see him soon. Martha says will you cover the new Dusty Springfield for the supermarket? Derek says … Derek says …
MAGGIE
Yeah, what does Derek say?
ARTHUR
Derek says … I don’t know what Derek says. Far out. Out of sight. Wow man. Jeez. That’s what Derek says.
MAGGIE
What else?
ARTHUR
You said you loved me.
MAGGIE
I did. I did love you. I loved you the way you used to be.
ARTHUR
But it’s you that’s made me the way I am now.
MAGGIE
I know. That’s what’s called irony.
ARTHUR
Maggie.
MAGGIE
Nothing’s going to stop me. No one. Ever. Let me do what I want.
ARTHUR
Right.
MAGGIE
Poor Arthur. You’d like to be hip. But your intelligence will keep shining through.
ARTHUR
Ha ha.
MAGGIE
Don’t want to start a …
INCH
I jus’ drove the van across the cricket pitch.
LAURA
Well done.
INCH
I reckon it’ll be takin’ spin this year.
MAGGIE
Really? Where?
INCH
About seven ’undred and fifty of ’em. An’ all round, I’d say.
SARAFFIAN
My dear.
MAGGIE
Saraffian.
SARAFFIAN
Well done. Very educational. We have all learnt something tonight.
MAGGIE
What’s that?
SARAFFIAN
Always put an arson clause in the contract. I’m going to have to pay for this.
INCH
Right.
SARAFFIAN
My God, but that was fun.
ARTHUR
Is anyone hurt?
SARAFFIAN
Can I tell you a story? I really must tell you a story now.
WILSON
Congratulations.
MAGGIE
Thank you.
WILSON
It’s really beautiful.
MAGGIE
Better than taking your trousers down?
WILSON
Oh yea. It’s jus’ a different thing.
MAGGIE
Right.
WILSON
If yer don’t mind, I’ve ’eard there’s a psychology tutor on fire, I’d really like to see it you know.
MAGGIE
Sure.
WILSON
It’s so stupid it’s just wonderful.
INCH
Hey, ’old on, Wilson, I think I’ll come and drag some naked women from the flames.
SARAFFIAN
I’ll tell you of my evening at the Café de Paris. March 9th, 1941.
ARTHUR
You won’t put it out with that.
NASH
This ain’t for the fire. It’s for Peyote.
SARAFFIAN
I was with this girl. She’s related to a marquis on her mother’s side and me a boy from Tottenham whose dad ran a spieler in his own back room. So I’m something of a toy, a bauble on her arm. And she said, please can we go to the Café de Paris, I think because she wants to shock her pals by being seen with me, but also because she does genuinely want to dance to the music of Snakehips Johnson and his Caribbean band.
AND MY FIRST THOUGHT IS
I’m with you, pal.
MAGGIE
Bollocks. I just wanted to go to jail.
LAURA
They really do seem to want you, Maggie. Can they have you now?
MAGGIE
What a load of shit. You’re full of shit, Saraffian. What a crucial insight, what a great moment in the Café de Paris. And what did you do the next thirty years?
LAURA
Yes.
MAGGIE
You can have your hat back, all the hats he wants to give you, you can have. Anything I said about you, I withdraw. The tightness of your arse I apologize. You’re Mahatma Gandhi, you’re the Pope. Arthur, you’re Cole Porter. Or at least you will be. Or at least nobody else ever will be.
LAURA
Shall I let you know how it goes in Stoke?
MAGGIE
If you make it.
LAURA
What?
MAGGIE
I’m only guessing. But I’d take a bet this band never plays again. When did you cancel Stoke?
SARAFFIAN
About a week ago.
MAGGIE
There.
SARAFFIAN
You know me too well.
MAGGIE
So I go to jail. Nobody is to think about me, nobody is to say, ‘How is she these days?’ Nobody to mention me. Nobody to say, ‘How much does she drink?’ Nobody is to remember. Nobody is to feel guilty. Nobody is to feel they might have done better. Remember. I’m nobody’s excuse.
LAURA
What are you on?
ARTHUR
On?
LAURA
Transport.
ARTHUR
Oh. Motor-sickle.
LAURA
Is there room on the back?
ARTHUR
Sure.
LAURA
Will you give us a tune? One of those awful old ones you like …
WILSON
That was the best night I ’ad in years.
NASH
Really brightened up the evenin’.
WILSON
Yeah.
NASH
I thought we was gonna ’ave a real flop on ’our ’ands.
INCH
Funny ’ow plastic burns in’ it?
WILSON
Yeah, all sorta blue wiv little fringes.
INCH
And formica doesn’t.
NASH
That’s right. I noticed that.
INCH
I kept ’oldin’ it in the flames but nothin’.
SMEGS
So what do we do?
LAURA
The police said we can all bugger off.
INCH
Then we go ’ome, that’s what we do.
WILSON
Great.
INCH
The van’s over there.
WILSON
Anyone fancy a game?
SMEGS
Sure.
WILSON
Seven-card stud? I got some cards in the back. Perhaps we could try some new rules I got …
LAURA
Where did you put your helmet?
ARTHUR
I used to think it was so easy, you know. If I leave her, she’ll kill herself. I thought she’s only got one problem. She doesn’t know how to be happy. But that’s not her problem at all. Her problem is
LAURA
Play us a dreadful old tune.
ARTHUR
Laura. It just wouldn’t work between us. Not now.
INCH
There’s ’ardly any petrol left in the van. I can’t find the spare can.
ARTHUR
Maggie took it. To burn down the tent.
INCH
That’s a bit fuckin’ inconsiderate, she mighta noticed we was short o’ gas. Lend us a couple of quid somebody. Arfer?
ARTHUR
Don’t have it.
INCH
Well, sorry to say this, Laura, but we’re gonna ’ave to sell your body. And pretty bloody fast. Somewhere between ’ere an’ Baldock you’re gonna ’ave to do it in the road.
LAURA
I’ve only waited six years. You might have mentioned it before.
ARTHUR
Yes. Yes. It was silly.
SARAFFIAN
I had a look at the cellars.
ARTHUR
Ah.
SARAFFIAN
The stock is remarkable. The 1949 Romanée St Vivant is like gold-dust you know.
ARTHUR
Did you, er …
SARAFFIAN
Unfortunately, not. They’d padlocked the racks.
ARTHUR
Ah.
INCH
Laura, get your fat butt in ’ere.
SARAFFIAN
Of course, this college was once famous for its port.
ARTHUR
I didn’t know that.
SARAFFIAN
The finest cellar of vintage port in England. Then in 1940 when the dons heard Hitler was coming … Hitler was coming …
ARTHUR
Laura, can you stop crying …
SARAFFIAN
Hitler was coming …
ARTHUR
I can’t hear what Saraffian is saying.
SARAFFIAN
They drank it. So he wouldn’t get his fat German hands on it. Their contribution to the war effort. Four thousand bottles in just eleven months.
ARTHUR
Leave her.
PEYOTE
Fantastic.
ARTHUR
Yeah.
PEYOTE
Fuckin’ on a fire engine, you wouldn’t believe it.
ARTHUR
What’s the time?
SARAFFIAN
Just gone four.
LAURA
When are you going to tell them?
SARAFFIAN
Who?
LAURA
The band.
SARAFFIAN
Oh, tomorrow. Enough for one day.
WILSON
Laura. You comin’ wiv us?
LAURA
Yes. Yes. I’m coming with you.
WILSON
I don’t know why you lot make it so ’ard for yerselves.
WILSON
Right. Well. Back into the little tin hell. Always makes me feel like bloody Alec Guinness. You know, into the ’ot metal ’ut. And at the other end, well we may be a little sweaty about the lip an’ doin’ that funny walk but fuck me if we ain’t whistlin’ Colonel Bogey. Goodnight all.
SARAFFIAN
Goodnight lads.
ARTHUR
Goodnight.
I KNEW A GUY
they made Pink Floyd sound like a Mozart quintet. I said to him, why the hell don’t you wear muffs? In eighteen months you’re going to be stone deaf. He said
SARAFFIAN
Don’t worry. Have some brandy.
ARTHUR
What?
SARAFFIAN
Napoleon. Was waiting till those buggers had gone.
RANDOLPH
I rung the wife.
SARAFFIAN
Thank you.
RANDOLPH
Bloke answered.
SARAFFIAN
So.
ARTHUR
Who’s the bloke?
SARAFFIAN
Where did I put the car?
ARTHUR
Who’s the bloke?
SARAFFIAN
Oh, Mrs Saraffian’s friend. Called Wetherby. Secretary of the local golf club, I’m afraid. Mean with a nine iron. She likes his manners. I rev the Jag in the drive, rattle the milk bottles, you know, wait ten minutes, then … enter my home.
ARTHUR
Where is the money? And where are the girls?
SNEAD
Sir.
ARTHUR
Thank you, Mr Snead. Why are you frightened? Why’s everyone frightened?
SUSAN
And the food.
ALICE
Yeah. The wet. The cold. The flu. The food. The loveless English. How is he?
SUSAN
Fine.
ALICE
The blood is spectacular.
SUSAN
The blood is from his thumb.
ALICE
Turkey neck and turkey gristle, isn’t that what they say?
SUSAN
He had a couple of Nembutal and twelve fingers of Scotch. It’s nothing else, don’t worry.
ALICE
And a fight.
SUSAN
A short fight.
ALICE
Chinese takeaway. Want some?
SUSAN
It’s six o’clock in the morning.
ALICE
Sweet and sour prawn.
SUSAN
No thanks.
ALICE
You should. You worked as hard as I did. When we started last night, I didn’t think it could be done.
SUSAN
It’s a Yale. There’s a mortise as well but I’ve lost the key. There’s a cleaning lady next door, should you want one, her work’s good but don’t try talking about the blacks. You have a share in that garden in the centre of the square, you know all those trees and flowers they keep locked up. The milkman calls daily, again he’s nice, but don’t touch the yoghurt, it’s green, we call it Venusian sperm.
ALICE
Are you sure you can’t stay? I think you’d like them.
SUSAN
Unmarried mothers, I don’t think I’d get on.
ALICE
I’m going to ring round at nine o’clock. If you just stayed on for a couple of hours …
SUSAN
You don’t really want that, nobody would.
ALICE
You’ve given me the house, and you went on your way.
SUSAN
Tell him I left with nothing that was his. I just walked out on him. Everything to go.
BROCK
Darling.
ALICE

Ici Londres. Les voix de la liberté. Ensuite quelques messages personnels. Mon Oncle Albert a perdu son chien. Mon – Oncle – Albert – a – perdu – son – chien.
SUSAN
Eh, qu’est-ce que vous faites ici?
LAZAR
Ah rien. Laisse-moi un moment, je peux tout expliquer.
SUSAN
Donnez-moi votre sac.
LAZAR
Where am I?
SUSAN
Please be quiet. I can’t hear when you speak. There’s a road. Through the wood. Gestapo patrol.
LAZAR
I see.
SUSAN
I thought I heard something.
LAZAR
Are you waiting for supplies?
SUSAN
On the hour. There’s meant to be a drop. I thought it was early, that’s why I flashed.
LAZAR
I’m sorry. We had to take advantage of your light. We were losing fuel. I’m afraid I’m meant to be eighty miles on. Can you … could you tell me where I am?
SUSAN
You’ve landed near a village called St Benoît. It’s close to a town called Poitiers, all right?
LAZAR
Yes. I think. I have heard of it you know.
SUSAN
Hadn’t you better take that thing off?
LAZAR
We are in the same racket, I suppose?
SUSAN
Well we’re pretty well dished if we aren’t. Did you spot any movement as you came down?
LAZAR
None at all. We just picked out your light.
SUSAN
If you didn’t see anything I’d like to hold on. We need the drop badly – explosives and guns.
LAZAR
Have you come out on your own?
SUSAN
I’d rather not look at you. It’s an element of risk which we really don’t need to take. In my experience it is best, it really is best if you always obey the rules.
LAZAR
But you’d like me to hold on and help you I think?
SUSAN
All right, if you could just …
LAZAR
Look the opposite … yes. I will. I’m delighted.
SUSAN
If you could hold on, I’m sure I could find you a bike.
LAZAR
Would you like a cigarette?
SUSAN
Thank you very much.
LAZAR
Yes.
SUSAN
Well don’t. And don’t hide your receiver in the cistern, the whole dodge is badly out of date. The Gestapo have been crashing into lavatories for a full two months. Never take the valley road beyond Poitiers, I’ll show you a side-road.
LAZAR
How long have you been here?
SUSAN
Perhaps a year. Off and on. How’s everyone at home?
LAZAR
They’re fine.
SUSAN
The boss?
LAZAR
Fine. Gave me some cufflinks at the aerodrome. Told me my chances.
SUSAN
Fifty-fifty?
LAZAR
Yes.
SUSAN
He’s getting out of touch.
LAZAR
How has it been?
SUSAN
Well … the Germans are still here.
LAZAR
You mean we’re failing?
SUSAN
Not at all. It’s part of our brief. Keep them here, keep them occupied. Blow up their bridges, devastate the roads, so they have to waste their manpower chasing after us. Divert them from the front. Well that’s what we’ve done.
LAZAR
I see.
SUSAN
But it’s the worst thing about the job, the more successful you are, the longer it goes on.
LAZAR
Until we win.
SUSAN
Oh yes.
LAZAR
Do you have dark hair?
SUSAN
What?
LAZAR
One strand across your face. Very young. Sitting one day next to the mahogany door. At the recruitment place. And above your shoulder at the other side, Whitaker’s Almanack.
SUSAN
You know who I am.
LAZAR
That’s it over there.
SUSAN
Wait.
LAZAR
Isn’t that it?
SUSAN
Don’t move across. Just wait.
LAZAR
That’s the drop.
SUSAN
It’s all right, leave it. It’s safer to wait a moment or two.
LAZAR
Oh my God.
SUSAN
What?
LAZAR
Out across the field. Look …
SUSAN
Get down.
LAZAR
He’s picking it up. Let’s get away from here.
SUSAN
No.
LAZAR
Come on, for God’s sake …
SUSAN
No.
LAZAR
If it’s the Gestapo …
SUSAN
Gestapo nothing, it’s the bloody French.
FRENCHMAN
Si, c’est à nous. Je ne vous connais pas.
SUSAN
Non, l’avion était anglais. C’est à nous.
FRENCHMAN
Non, c’est désigné pour la résistance.
LAZAR
Oh God.
SUSAN
Vous savez bien que c’est nous qui devons diriger le mouvement de tous les armements. Pour les Français c’est tout à fait impossible …
FRENCHMAN
Va te faire foutre.
SUSAN
Si vous ne me le donnez pas …
FRENCHMAN
Les Anglais n’ont jamais compris la France. Il faut absolument que ce soit les Français qui déterminent notre avenir.
SUSAN
Posez ça …
FRENCHMAN
C’est pour la France.
LAZAR
Please put it down.
FRENCHMAN
Nobody ask you. Nobody ask you to come. Vous n’êtes pas les bienvenus ici.
LAZAR
Compris.
FRENCHMAN
Espèce de con.
LAZAR
Bloody Gaullists.
SUSAN
I don’t know.
LAZAR
I mean really.
SUSAN
They just expect the English to die. They sit and watch us spitting blood in the streets.
LAZAR
Here’s your gun.
SUSAN
I’m sorry, I’m so frightened.
LAZAR
I must bury the silk.
SUSAN
I’m not an agent, I’m just a courier. I carry messages between certain circuits …
LAZAR
Please …
SUSAN
I came tonight, it’s my first drop, there is literally nobody else, I can’t tell you the mess in Poitiers …
LAZAR
Please.
SUSAN
My friend, the man I mentioned, he’s been taken to Buchenwald. He was the wireless operator, please let me tell you, his name was Tony …
LAZAR
I can’t help.
SUSAN
I have to talk …
LAZAR
No.
SUSAN
What’s the point, what’s the point of following the rules if …?
LAZAR
You mustn’t …
SUSAN
I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die like that.
LAZAR
Did you know … did you know sound waves never die? So every noise we make goes into the sky. And there is a place somewhere in the corner of the universe where all the babble of the world is kept.
SUSAN
Un ciel pommelé.
LAZAR
Un ciel pommelé. Marvellous. I must find a place to slip it in. Now. Where will I find this bike?
SUSAN
I don’t know your name.
ANNOUNCER
Ici Bruxelles – INR. Et maintenant notre soirée continue avec la musique de Victor Sylvester et son orchestre. Victor Sylvester est parmi les musiciens anglais les plus aimés à cause de ses maintes émissions à la radio anglaise pendant la guerre.
BROCK
Sir Leonard …
DARWIN
Come in.
BROCK
A few moments of your time. If I could possibly …
DARWIN
You have my ear.
BROCK
The case of a British national who’s died. It’s just been landed in my lap. A tourist named Radley’s dropped dead in his hotel. It was a coronary, seems fairly clear. The Belgian police took the matter in hand, but naturally the widow has come along to us. It should be quite easy, she’s taking it well.
DARWIN
If you’d like to sit down.
BROCK
I’ve already taken certain practical steps. I’ve been to the mortuary.
SUSAN
That’s very kind.
BROCK
Belgian undertakers.
DARWIN
One need not say more. Your husband had a heart attack, is that right?
SUSAN
Yes. In the foyer of our hotel.
DARWIN
Painless …
SUSAN
I would hope. He was packing the car. We were planning to move on this morning. We only have two weeks. We were hoping to make Innsbruck, at least if our travel allowance would last. It was our first holiday since the war.
DARWIN
Brock, a handkerchief.
SUSAN
No.
BROCK
I was persuaded to opt for an embalming, I’m afraid. It may involve you in some small extra cost.
SUSAN
Excuse me, but you’ll have to explain the point.
BROCK
Sorry?
SUSAN
Of the embalming I mean.
BROCK
Well, particularly in the summer it avoids the possibility of the body exploding at a bad moment. I mean any moment would be bad, it goes without saying, but on the aeroplane, say.
SUSAN
I see.
BROCK
You see, normally you find the body’s simply washed … I don’t know how much detail you want me to provide …
DARWIN
I would think it better if …
SUSAN
No, I would like to know. Tony was a doctor. He would want me to know.
BROCK
To be honest I was surprised at how little there is to do. There’s a small bottle of spirit, colourless, and they simply give the body a wash. The only other thing is the stomach, if there’s been a meal, a recent meal …
SUSAN
Tony had …
BROCK
Yes, he had breakfast I think. You insert a pipe into the corpse’s stomach to let the gases out. They insert it and there’s a strange sort of sigh.
DARWIN
If, er …
BROCK
It leaves almost no mark. Apparently, so they told me, the morgue attendants when they’re bored sometimes set light to the gas for a joke. Makes one hell of a bang.
DARWIN
Shall we all have a drink?
BROCK
But of course I’m sure it didn’t happen in this particular case.
DARWIN
No. There is gin. There is tonic. Yes?
SUSAN
Thank you.
BROCK
I’m afraid we shall need to discuss the practical arrangements. I know the whole subject is very distressing but there is the question … you do want the body flown back?
SUSAN
Well, I can hardly stash it in the boot of the car.
DARWIN
What the Third Secretary is saying … not buried on foreign soil.
SUSAN
No.
BROCK
Quite. You see for the moment we take care of it, freight charges, and His Majesty’s Government picks up the bill. But perhaps later we will have to charge it to the estate, if there is an estate. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to interfere …
SUSAN
I’m sure there’ll be enough to pay for it all. Tony made a very reasonable living.
DARWIN
Well, I think we now understand your needs. I shall go downstairs and set the matter in train.
BROCK
Would you prefer it if I did that, sir?
DARWIN
No, no. You stay and talk to Mrs Radley. I’ll have a word with the travel people, make a booking on tomorrow morning’s flight, if that suits?
SUSAN
Yes, of course.
DARWIN
You will be going back with the body, I assume?
SUSAN
Yes.
DARWIN
Are there other dependants? Children?
SUSAN
No.
BROCK
If …
SUSAN
He doesn’t like you.
BROCK
Sorry.
SUSAN
The ambassador.
BROCK
Oh. Well, no.
SUSAN
I shouldn’t have said that.
BROCK
No, it’s just … Darwin thinks disasters are examinations in etiquette. Which fork to use in an earthquake.
SUSAN
Darwin, is that his name?
BROCK
Yes, the mission all thinks it’s God’s joke. God getting his own back by dashing off a modern Darwin who is in every aspect less advanced than the last. I’m sorry. We sit about in the evenings and polish our jokes. Brussels is rather a debilitating town.
SUSAN
Is this a bad posting for you?
BROCK
I’d been hoping for something more positive. Fresher air. The flag still flies over a quarter of the human race and I would like to have seen it really. Whereas here … we’re left with the problems of the war … Have you met any prison governors?
SUSAN
No.
BROCK
It’s just they talk exactly like us. I was hoping for Brixton but I got the Scrubs. Just the same.
SUSAN
Does nobody like it here?
BROCK
The misery is contagious, I suppose. You spend the day driving between bombsites, watching the hungry, the homeless, the bereaved. We think there are thirty million people loose in Europe who’ve had to flee across borders, have had to start again. And it is very odd to watch it all from here. Had you been married long?
SUSAN
We met during the war.
BROCK
I did notice some marks on the body.
SUSAN
Tony was a wireless operator with SOE. Our job was harassment behind the lines. Very successful in Holland, Denmark. Less so in France. Tony was in a circuit the Gestapo destroyed. Then scattered. Ravensbrück, Buchenwald, Saarbrucken, Dachau. Some were tortured, executed.
BROCK
What did you do?
SUSAN
I was a courier. I was never caught.
BROCK
No.
SUSAN
Had you realized that?
BROCK
I’d thought it possible.
SUSAN
What about Darwin, did he realize?
BROCK
Lord, no, it would never occur to him.
SUSAN
Motoring together it was easier to say we were man and wife. In fact I was barely even his mistress. He simply rang me a few weeks ago and asked if I’d like a holiday abroad. I was amazed. People in our organization really didn’t know each other all that well. You made it your business to know as little as possible, it was a point of principle. Even now you don’t know who most of your colleagues were. Perhaps you were in it. Perhaps I met you. I don’t know.
BROCK
Perhaps I will. May I ask a question?
SUSAN
Yes.
BROCK
If you’re not his wife, did he have one?
SUSAN
Yes.
BROCK
I see.
SUSAN
And three children. I had to lie about those, I couldn’t claim them somehow. She lives in Crediton in Devon. She believes that Tony was travelling alone. He’d told her he needed two weeks by himself. That’s what I was hoping you could do for me.
BROCK
Ah.
SUSAN
Phone her. I’ve written the number down. I’m afraid I did it before I came.
BROCK
And lie?
SUSAN
Yes. I’d prefer it if you lied. But it’s up to you.
BROCK
That’s not what I said.
SUSAN
Please, it doesn’t matter.
BROCK
When did you choose me?
SUSAN
What?
BROCK
For the job. You didn’t choose Darwin.
SUSAN
I might have done.
BROCK
You don’t think you wear your suffering a little heavily? This smart club of people you belong to who had a very bad war …
SUSAN
All right.
BROCK
I mean I know it must have put you on a different level from the rest of us …
SUSAN
You won’t shame me, you know. There’s no point.
BROCK
Would you … perhaps I could ask you to dinner? Just so we could talk …
SUSAN
No. I refuse to tell you anything now. If I told you anything about myself you would just think I was pleading, that I was trying to get round you. So I tell you nothing. I just say look at me – don’t creep round the furniture – look at me and make a judgement.
BROCK
Well.
DARWIN
That’s done. First flight tomorrow without a hitch.
SUSAN
Thank you very much.
DARWIN
If there’s anything else. There is a small chapel in the embassy if you’d like to use it before you go.
SUSAN
Thank you.
DARWIN
No, not at all. Just a few months. Before that, Djakarta. We were hoping for something sunny but Brussels came along. Not that we’re complaining. They’ve certainly got something going here.
SUSAN
Really?
DARWIN
Oh yes. New Europe. Yes yes.
SUSAN
No thanks.
DARWIN
The diplomat’s eye is the clearest in the world. Seen from Djakarta this continent looks so old, so beautiful. We don’t realize what we have in our hands.
SUSAN
No.
BROCK
Your wife is asking if you’re ready for dinner, sir.
DARWIN
Right.
BROCK
And she wants your advice on her face.
DARWIN
You’ll see Mrs Radley to her hotel?
BROCK
Of course.
DARWIN
Goodbye, Mrs Radley. I’m sorry it hasn’t been a happier day.
BROCK
I’ve put in a call to England. There’s an hour’s delay.
SUSAN
No.
BROCK
Will you remind me to cancel your seat?
ANNOUNCER
This is the BBC Third Programme. Vorichef wrote Les Ossifiés in the year of the Paris Commune, but his struggle with Parkinson’s disease during the writing of the score has hitherto made it a peculiarly difficult manuscript for musicologists to interpret. However the leader of the Bremen Ensemble has recently done a magnificent work of reclamation. Vorichef died in an extreme state of senile dementia in 1878. This performance of his last work will be followed by a short talk in our series ‘Musicians and Disease’.
SUSAN
I want to move on. I do desperately want to feel I’m moving on.
ALICE
With him?
SUSAN
Well that’s the problem, isn’t it?
ALICE
You are Strange.
SUSAN
Well, what would you do?
ALICE
I’d trade him in.
SUSAN
Would you?
ALICE
I’d choose someone else off the street.
SUSAN
And what chance would you have tonight, within a mile, say, within a mile of here?
ALICE
Let me think. Does that take in Victoria Coach Station?
SUSAN
No.
ALICE
Then pretty slim.
SUSAN
Is that right?
ALICE
I know. It was better when the dung was fresh.
SUSAN
I don’t know why you bother …
ALICE
The writer must experience everything, every kind of degradation. Nothing is closed to him. It’s really the degradation that attracted me to the job.
SUSAN
I thought you were going to work tonight …
ALICE
I can’t write all the time. You have to live it before you can write it. What other way is there? Besides nicking it.
SUSAN
Is that done?
ALICE
Apparently. Once you start looking it seems most books are copied out of other books. Only it’s called tribute. Tribute to Hemingway. Means it’s nicked. Mine’s going to be tribute to Scott Fitzgerald. Have you read him?
SUSAN
No.
ALICE
Last Tycoon. Mine’s going to be like that. Not quite the same of course. Something of a bitch to make Ealing Broadway hum like Hollywood Boulevard but otherwise it’s in the bag.
SUSAN
You should get a job.
ALICE
I’ve had a job, I know what jobs are like. Had a job in your office.
SUSAN
For three days.
ALICE
It was enough.
SUSAN
How are you going to live?
ALICE
Off you mostly. Susan …
SUSAN
I want to move on. I do desperately want to feel I’m moving on.
ALICE
I remember.
SUSAN
They get heavier and heavier as the day goes on, I can barely stagger across the room for the weight of a single piece of paper, by the end of the day if you dropped one on the floor, you would smash your foot. The silence is worse. Dust gathering. Water lapping beyond the wall. It seems unreal. You can’t believe that because of the work you do ships pass and sail across the world. Mr Medlicott has moved into my office.
ALICE
Frightful Mr Medlicott?
SUSAN
Yes.
ALICE
The boss?
SUSAN
He has moved in. Or rather, more sinister still he has removed the frosted glass between our two offices.
ALICE
Really?
SUSAN
I came in one morning and found the partition had gone. I interpret it as the first step in a mating dance. I believe Medlicott stayed behind one night, set his ledger aside, ripped off his tweed suit and his high collar, stripped naked, took up an axe, swung it at the partition, dropped to the floor, rolled over in the broken glass till he bled, till his whole body streamed blood, then he cleared up, slipped home, came back next morning and waited to see if anything would be said. But I have said nothing. And neither has he. He puts his head down and does not lift it till lunch. I have to look across at his few strands of hair, like seaweed across his skull. And I am frightened of what the next step will be.
ALICE
I can imagine.
SUSAN
The sexual pressure is becoming intolerable.
ALICE
Then do. Just go. Have you never done that? I do it all the time.
SUSAN
They do need me in that place.
ALICE
So much the better, gives it much more point. That’s always the disappointment when I leave, I always go before people even notice I’ve come. But you … you could really make a splash.
SUSAN
I’d like to change everything but I don’t know how.
ALICE
Are you really fond of him?
SUSAN
You don’t see him at his best. We had a week in Brussels which we both enjoyed. Now he comes over for the weekend whenever he can. But he tends to be rather sick on the boat.
ALICE
You should meet someone younger.
SUSAN
That’s not what I mean. And I don’t really like young men. You’re through and out the other side in no time at all.
ALICE
I can introduce you …
SUSAN
I’m sure. I’ve only known you three weeks, but I’ve got the idea. Your flair for agonized young men. I think you get them in bulk from tuberculosis wards.
ALICE
I’m just catching up, that’s all.
SUSAN
Of course.
ALICE
I was a late starter.
SUSAN
Oh yes, what are you, eighteen?
ALICE
I started late. Out of guilt. I had a protected childhood. Till I ran away. And very bad guilt. I was frightened to masturbate more than once a week, I thought my clitoris was like a torch battery, you know, use it too much and it runs out.
BROCK
What time is it?
ALICE
Raymond, can you give us your view? I was just comparing the efficiency of a well-known household object with …
SUSAN
Alice, leave him alone.
ALICE
It’s getting on for five.
BROCK
I feel terrible.
SUSAN
I’ll get you something to eat. Omelette all right? It’s only powder, I’m afraid …
BROCK
Well …
SUSAN
Two spoons or three? And I’ll sprinkle it with Milk of Magnesia.
BROCK
It seems a bit pointless. It’s only twelve hours till I’m back on the boat. Did I miss something?
ALICE
No. She’s just fondling it.
BROCK
Ah.
ALICE
Music. On the wireless. You had us listening to some music.
BROCK
Ah that’s right.
ALICE
Some composer who shook.
BROCK
I thought you’d have gone. Don’t you have a flat?
ALICE
I did. But it had bad associations. I was disappointed in love.
BROCK
I see.
ALICE
And Susan said I could sleep here.
BROCK
I must say I do think your clothes are very smart.
ALICE
Well I tell you he looks very good in mine. Do you always bring her one of those?
BROCK
I certainly try to bring a gift if I can.
ALICE
You must have lots of money.
BROCK
Well, I suppose. I find it immoderately easy to acquire. I seem to have a sort of mathematical gift. The stock exchange. Money sticks to my fingers I find. I triple my income. What can I do?
ALICE
It must be very tiresome.
BROCK
Oh … I’m acclimatizing, you know. I think everyone’s going to be rich very soon. Once we’ve got over the effects of war. It’s going to be coming out of everyone’s ears.
ALICE
Is that what you think?
BROCK
I’m absolutely sure. I do enjoy these weekends you know. Susan leads such an interesting life. Books. Conversation. People like you. The Foreign Office can make you feel pretty isolated – also, to be honest, make you feel pretty small, as if you’re living on sufferance, you can imagine …
ALICE
Yes.
BROCK
Till I met Susan. The very day I met her, she showed me you must always do what you want. If you want something you must get it. I think that’s a wonderful way to live don’t you?
ALICE
I do. Shall I tell you how my book begins?
BROCK
Well …
ALICE
There’s a woman in a rape trial. And the story is true. The book begins at the moment where she has to tell the court what the accused has said to her on the night of the rape. And she finds she can’t bring herself to say the words out loud. And so the judge suggests she writes them down on a piece of paper and it be handed round the court. Which she does. And it says, ‘I want to have you. I must have you now.’ So they pass it round the jury who all read it and pass it on. At the end of the second row there’s a woman jurist who’s fallen asleep at the boredom of the trial. So the man next to her has to nudge her awake and hand her the slip of paper. She wakes up, looks at it, then at him, smiles and puts it in her handbag. That woman is my heroine.
BROCK
Well, yes.
SUSAN
Cheese omelette. What were you talking about?
ALICE
The rape trial.
SUSAN
Did you tell Raymond who the woman was?
BROCK
What do you mean?
SUSAN
I’m only joking, dear.
BROCK
I’m not sure it’s the sort of …
ALICE
Oh sod this stuff.
SUSAN
I said it was dung.
ALICE
I was promised visions.
BROCK
Well …
ALICE
It’s because I’m the only Bohemian in London. People exploit me. Because there are no standards, you see. In Paris or New York, there are plenty of Bohemians, so the kief is rich and sweet and plentiful but here … you’d be better off to lick the gum from your ration card.
SUSAN
Perhaps Raymond will be posted to Morocco, bring some back in his bag …
BROCK
I don’t think that’s really on.
SUSAN
Nobody would notice, from what you say. Nobody would notice if you smoked it yourself.
ALICE
Are they not very sharp?
SUSAN
Not according to Raymond. The ones I’ve met are buffoons …
BROCK
Susan, please …
SUSAN
Well it’s you who call them buffoons.
BROCK
It’s not quite what I say.
SUSAN
It’s you who tells the stories. That man Darwin …
BROCK
Please …
SUSAN
How he needs three young men from public schools to strap him into his surgical support.
BROCK
I told you that in confidence.
SUSAN
In gloves.
ALICE
Really?
BROCK
Darwin is not a buffoon.
SUSAN
From your own lips …
BROCK
He just has slight problems of adjustment to the modern age.
SUSAN
You are laughing.
BROCK
I am not laughing.
SUSAN
There is a slight smile at the corner of your mouth …
BROCK
There is not. There is absolutely no smile.
SUSAN
Alice, I will paraphrase, let me paraphrase Raymond’s view of his boss. I don’t misrepresent you, dear, it is, in paraphrase, in sum, that he would not trust him to stick his prick into a bucket of lard.
BROCK
Certainly he’s a joke.
SUSAN
Thank you.
BROCK
He’s a joke between us. He is not a joke to the entire world.
SUSAN
And I wish you wouldn’t use those words.
BROCK
What?
SUSAN
Words like ‘push off home’. You’re always saying it. ‘Bit of a tight corner’, ‘one hell of a spot’. They don’t belong.
BROCK
What do you mean?
SUSAN
They are not your words.
BROCK
Well, I’m none too keen on your words either.
SUSAN
Oh yes, which?
BROCK
The words you’ve been using this evening.
SUSAN
Such as?
BROCK
You know perfectly well.
SUSAN
Such as, come on tell me, what words have I used?
BROCK
Words like …
SUSAN
Alice, there is only the bath or the kitchen.
ALICE
I know.
BROCK
Are you going to let her live with you?
SUSAN
I like her. She makes me laugh.
BROCK
I’m sorry, I was awful, I apologize. But the work I do is not entirely contemptible. Of course our people are dull, they’re stuffy, they’re death. But what other world do I have?
SUSAN
I think of France more than I tell you. I was seventeen and I was thrown into the war. I often think of it.
BROCK
I’m sure.
SUSAN
The most unlikely people. People I met only for an hour or two. Astonishing kindnesses. Bravery. The fact you could meet someone for an hour or two and see the very best of them and then move on. Can you understand?
BROCK
Susan.
SUSAN
I think we should try a winter apart. I really do. I think it’s all a bit easy this way. These weekends. Nothing is tested. I think a test would be good. Then we would know. And what better test than a winter apart?
BROCK
A winter together.
SUSAN
I would love to come to Brussels, you know that. I would love to come if it weren’t for my job. But the shipping office is very important to me, I do find it fulfilling. And I just couldn’t let Mr Medlicott down.
BROCK
Don’t patronize me, Susan.
SUSAN
Anyway, perhaps in the spring, it would be really nice to meet …
BROCK
Please don’t insult my intelligence. I know you better than you think. I recognize the signs. When you talk longingly about the war … some deception usually follows.
SUSAN
Did you hear that?
ALICE
Certainly. I was writing it down.
SUSAN
Don’t.
ALICE
I dream better.
SUSAN
Do you know what you’re doing tomorrow?
ALICE
Not really. There’s a new jazz band at the One-O-One. And Ken wants to take me to Eel Pie Island in his horrid little car. I say I’ll go if I get to meet Alistair. I really do want to meet Alistair. Everyone says he’s got hair on his shoulder-blades and apparently he can crack walnuts in his armpits.
SUSAN
Oh well, he’ll never be short of friends.
ALICE
Quite.
SUSAN
What should I be doing with this?
ALICE
If we can’t eat it, let’s throw it away.
SUSAN
Oh really?
MICK
Five hundred cheese-graters.
SUSAN
Oh no.
MICK
I got five hundred cheese-graters parked round the side. Are you interested?
SUSAN
I’m afraid you’re too late. We took a consignment weeks ago.
MICK
Where we looking?
SUSAN
Across the river. Over there.
MICK
Where?
SUSAN
South Bank. That’s where the fireworks are going to be. And there’s my barrage balloon.
MICK
Oh yeah. What does it say?
SUSAN
Don’t say that, that’s the worst thing you can say.
MICK
It’s dark.
SUSAN
It says ‘Bovril’.
MICK
Oh, Bovril.
SUSAN
Yes. It’s meant to blaze out over London.
MICK
Surprised it hasn’t got your name on.
SUSAN
What do you mean?
MICK
Everywhere I go.
SUSAN
I managed to steal some supper from the Festival Hall. There’s a reception for its opening night. They’re using your cutlery, I’m happy to say.
MICK
I wish I could see it.
SUSAN
Yes, yes, I wish you could too. I’ve actually decided to leave the Festival now. Having worked so hard to get the wretched thing on. I’m thinking of going into advertising.
MICK
Ah very good.
SUSAN
I met some people on the Bovril side. It’s … well I doubt if it’ll stretch me, but it would be a way of having some fun. Would you like a canapé?
MICK
How’s Alice?
SUSAN
She’s very well.
MICK
Haven’t seen her lately.
SUSAN
No.
MICK
She went mainstream you see. I stayed revivalist. Different religion. For me it all stops in 1919.
SUSAN
I’m looking for a father. I want to have a child.
MICK
Ah.
SUSAN
You don’t want to?
MICK
No, no, I’m delighted, I’m lucky to be asked.
SUSAN
Not at all.
MICK
But it’s just … your own people. I mean friends, you must have friends.
SUSAN
It’s …
MICK
I mean …
SUSAN
Sorry.
MICK
No, go on, say.
SUSAN
The men I know at work, at the Festival, or even friends I’ve known for years, they just aren’t the kind of people I would want to marry.
MICK
Ah.
SUSAN
I’m afraid I’m rather strong-minded, as you know, and so with them I usually feel I’m holding myself in for fear of literally blowing them out of the room. They are kind, they are able, but I don’t see … why I should have to compromise, why I should have to make some sad and decorous marriage just to have a child. I don’t see why any woman should have to do that.
MICK
But you don’t have to marry …
SUSAN
Ah well …
MICK
Just go off with them.
SUSAN
But that’s really the problem. These same men, these kind and likeable men, they do have another side to their nature and that is they are very limited in their ideas, they are frightened of the unknown, they want a quiet life where sex is either sport or duty but absolutely nothing in between, and they simply would not agree to sleep with me if they knew it was a child I was after.
MICK
But you wouldn’t have to tell them.
SUSAN
I did think that. But then I thought it would be dishonest. And so I had the idea of asking a person whom I barely knew.
MICK
What about the kid?
SUSAN
What?
MICK
Doesn’t sound a very good deal. Never to see his dad …
SUSAN
It’s not …
MICK
I take it that is what you mean.
SUSAN
I think it’s what I mean.
MICK
Well?
SUSAN
The child will manage.
MICK
How do you know?
SUSAN
Being a bastard won’t always be so bad.
MICK
I wouldn’t bet on it.
SUSAN
England can’t be like this for ever.
MICK
I would like to know …
SUSAN
Yes?
MICK
Why you chose me. I mean, how often have you met me?
SUSAN
Yes, but that’s the whole point ….
MICK
With Alice a few times …
SUSAN
And you sold me some spoons.
MICK
They were good spoons.
SUSAN
I’m not denying it.
MICK
And Alice says what? That I’m clean and obedient and don’t have any cretins in the family?
SUSAN
It’s not as calculated as that.
MICK
Not calculated? Several hundred of us, was there, all got notes …
SUSAN
No.
MICK
… saying come and watch the Festival fireworks, tell no one, bring no friends. All the secrecy, I thought you must at least be after nylons …
SUSAN
I’ll buy nylons. If that’s what you want.
MICK
So why me?
SUSAN
I like you.
MICK
And.
SUSAN
‘I love you’?
MICK
Different class.
SUSAN
That comes into it.
MICK
Oh dear.
SUSAN
Then laugh.
MICK
It can’t be what you want. Not deep down.
SUSAN
No.
MICK
I didn’t think so.
SUSAN
Deep down I’d do the whole damn thing by myself.
MICK
Five hundred cheese-graters.
SUSAN
How much?
MICK
Something over the odds. A bit over the odds. Not much.
SUSAN
Done.
MICK
Fireworks. If you …
SUSAN
What?
MICK
Stay for the fireworks.
SUSAN
If you like.
MICK
Great sky.
SUSAN
Yes.
MICK
The light. Those dots.
SUSAN
A mackerel sky.
MICK
What?
SUSAN
That’s what they call it. A mackerel sky.
SUSAN
This is hell.
ALICE
No doubt.
SUSAN
I am living in hell.
ALICE
Shall we hear it again?
SUSAN
You’re only allowed it once. Hear it too much and you get out of hand.
ALICE
It’s true. I’d give that up if I were you. We have to go pretty soon.
SUSAN
Why do I lie?
ALICE
We have to get there by midnight.
SUSAN
What do I do it for?
ALICE
It’s your profession.
SUSAN
That’s what’s wrong. In France …
ALICE
Ah France.
SUSAN
I told such glittering lies. But where’s the fun in lying for a living?
ALICE
What’s today’s?
SUSAN
Some leaking footwear. Some rotten shoe I have to advertise. What is the point? Why do I exist?
ALICE
Sold out.
SUSAN
Sold out. Is that the phrase?
ALICE
Turn over, let me do the other side.
SUSAN
To produce what my masters call good copy, it is simply a question of pitching my intelligence low enough. Shutting my eyes and imagining what it’s like to be very, very stupid. This is all the future holds for any of us. We will spend the next twenty years of our lives pretending to be thick. ‘I’m sorry, Miss Traherne, we’d like to employ you, but unfortunately you are not stupid enough.’
ALICE
You’re all trunk up to here, OK?
LOUISE
Yeah, right.
ALICE
The trunk is all one, so you just have to keep your legs together. Then you break into leaf, just above the bust.
LOUISE
Do I get conkers?
ALICE
No. If you were a chestnut, you’d get conkers. But you’re an oak.
LOUISE
What does an oak have?
ALICE
An oak has acorns.
LOUISE
Acorns?
ALICE
But you won’t need them, I promise. We scorn gimmicks. We will win as we are.
SUSAN
The last night of the year …
ALICE
And I will sell a great many paintings.
SUSAN
Oh yes?
LOUISE
I met them in the street, I’d just left home, come down the A6.
SUSAN
Good for you.
LOUISE
I couldn’t believe my luck.
ALICE
Willy’s going as a kipper, I do know that. And Emma’s a prostitute though how we’re meant to know it’s fancy dress I really can’t think.
LOUISE
I’ve gathered that.
ALICE
Otherwise I expect the usual historical riff-raff. Henry VIII, that sort of thing. We ought to walk it with a naked oak.
LOUISE
Will that friend of yours be there?
ALICE
No. He’ll be tucked up with his syphilitic wife.
LOUISE
Why doesn’t he …?
SUSAN
Shut up, Louise.
ALICE
It’s all right. Ask what you want.
LOUISE
How do you know she’s syphilitic?
ALICE
How do you think? She passed it down the line.
LOUISE
Oh God.
ALICE
Or somebody passed it and I’ve decided to blame her. It seems right somehow. She’s a very plausible incubator for a social disease. Back over.
LOUISE
Why doesn’t he leave?
ALICE
Who?
LOUISE
Your friend.
ALICE
Ah well, if they ever did leave their wives, perhaps the whole sport would die. For all of us.
SUSAN
Roll on 1953.
ALICE
Actually the clinic say it’s non-specific urethritis, which I find rather insulting. I did at least expect the doctor to come out and apologize and say, I’m sorry not to be more specific about your urethritis, but no, they just leave you in the air.
MICK
I wonder, does anyone mind if I come in?
ALICE
Mick?
MICK
Would you mind if I …?
SUSAN
How did you get this address?
ALICE
Do you two know each other?
MICK
Happy New Year.
ALICE
Mick, may I introduce you to Louise?
LOUISE
Hello, Mick.
MICK
Hello, Louise.
ALICE
Louise is going to the Arts Ball, I’m painting her …
MICK
Ah.
ALICE
She’s going as a tree.
SUSAN
Mick, I really don’t want to talk to you.
ALICE
What’s wrong?
MICK
Is she really going to walk down the street …
SUSAN
I thought we’d agreed. You promised me, Mick. You made a promise. Never to meet again.
MICK
I just thought… well it’s New Year’s Eve and well … one or two weeks have gone by …
SUSAN
Have you been watching the house? Is that how you found me? Have you been following me home?
LOUISE
Does anyone mind if I put my clothes on?
ALICE
She’s not finished. She’ll look good when it’s done.
SUSAN
I asked Mick to father a child, that’s what we’re talking about.
MICK
Oh Christ.
SUSAN
Well we have tried over eighteen months, that’s right? And we have failed.
MICK
Right.
SUSAN
Which leaves us both feeling pretty stupid, pretty wretched I would guess, speaking for myself. And there is a point of decency at which the experiment should stop.
MICK
Susan …
SUSAN
We have nothing in common, never did, that was part of the idea …
MICK
It just feels bad …
SUSAN
The idea was fun, it was simple, it depended on two adults behaving like adults.
MICK
It feels very bad to be used.
SUSAN
I would have stopped it months ago, I would have stopped it in the second month …
MICK
You come out feeling dirty.
SUSAN
And how do I feel? What am I meant to feel? Crawling about in your tiny bedroom, paper-thin walls, your mother sitting downstairs …
MICK
Don’t bring my mum into this.
SUSAN
Scrabbling about on bombsites, you think I enjoy all that?
MICK
Yeah. Very much. I think you do.
SUSAN
I know what you think. You think I enjoy slumming around. Then why have I not looked for another father? Because the whole exploit has broken my heart.
MICK
You think it’s my fault.
SUSAN
Oh Lord, is that all you’re worried about?
MICK
You think it’s something to do with me?
SUSAN
That was part of it, never to have to drag through this kind of idiot argument …
MICK
Well it is quite important.
SUSAN
You don’t understand. You don’t understand the figures in my mind.
LOUISE
I’ll tell the others. You may be late.
ALICE
There are some branches. You have to tie them round your wrists.
LOUISE
Thanks all the same. I’ll just go as myself.
SUSAN
Mick, will you go now please?
MICK
You people are cruel.
SUSAN
Please.
MICK
You are cruel and dangerous.
SUSAN
Mick.
MICK
You fuck people up. This little tart and her string of married men, all fucked up, all fucking ruined by this tart. And you … and you …
MICK
Jesus Christ.
AUNG
Two great nations, sir. The Americans and the English. Like the Romans and the Greeks. Americans are the Romans – power, armies, strength. The English are the Greeks – ideas, civilization, intellect. Between them they shall rule the world.
DARWIN
Good Lord, I hope you haven’t hung on for me.
BROCK
Leonard, come in, how kind of you to come.
DARWIN
Not at all.
BROCK
Our little gathering. We’d scarcely dared hope …
DARWIN
There seemed nothing left to do.
BROCK
Leonard, you know M. Aung, of course?
AUNG
Mr Darwin.
DARWIN
Rangoon.
BROCK
Now First Secretary, Burmese Embassy.
BROCK
Let me get you a drink.
DARWIN
That would be very kind.
BROCK
I’ll just tell my wife you’re here.
AUNG
Affairs of state?
DARWIN
Yes, if you …
AUNG
Say no more. We have eaten. We did not wait. In Burma we say if you cannot be on time, do not come at all.
DARWIN
Really?
AUNG
But of course the English it is different. At your command the lion makes its bed with the lamb.
DARWIN
Hardly.
AUNG
Don’t worry. All will be well. Ah Darwin of Djakarta, to have met the man, to have been alone with him. I shall dine in on this for many years.
DARWIN
Dine out on this.
AUNG
Ah the English language, she is a demanding mistress, yes?
DARWIN
If you like.
AUNG
And no one controls her so well as you sir. You beat her and the bitch obeys. The language of the world. Good, good. I have learnt the phrase from you. Out of your mouth. Good, good. I am behind you sir.
SUSAN
Leonard, how good of you to make an appearance.
DARWIN
I’m only sorry I’ve been delayed.
SUSAN
Brock says you’re all ragged with fatigue. I hear you’ve been having the most frightful week …
DARWIN
It has been, yes.
SUSAN
Well, don’t worry. Here at least you can relax. You’ve met Mr Aung?
DARWIN
Indeed.
SUSAN
You can forget everything. The words ‘Suez Canal’ will not be spoken.
DARWIN
That will be an enormous relief.
SUSAN
They are banned, you will not hear them.
DARWIN
Thank you, my dear.
SUSAN
Nasser, nobody will mention his name.
DARWIN
Quite.
SUSAN
Nobody will say ‘blunder’ or ‘folly’ or ‘fiasco’. Nobody will say ‘international laughing stock’. You are among friends, Leonard. I will rustle up some food.
AUNG
Of course, in such company I am privileged to change sex.
SUSAN
Nobody will say ‘death-rattle of the ruling class’. We have stuck our lips together with marron glacé. I hope you understand.
BROCK
Sorry, I …
DARWIN
It’s all right.
BROCK
I did ask her to calm down.
DARWIN
I’m getting used to it.
BROCK
She’s been giving me hell. She knows how closely you’ve been involved …
DARWIN
Do you think we could leave the subject, Brock?
BROCK
Of course.
DARWIN
At least she got rid of that appalling wog. I mean, in honesty, Raymond, what are you trying to do to me?
BROCK
I’m sorry, sir.
DARWIN
This week of all weeks. He had his tongue stuck so far up my fundament all you could see of him were the soles of his feet.
BROCK
No, she just … feels very strongly. Well, you know …
DARWIN
But there has been mental illness?
BROCK
In the past.
DARWIN
Yes?
BROCK
Before we were married. Some years ago. She’d been living very foolishly, a loose set in Pimlico. And a series of jobs, pushing herself too hard. Not eating. We got engaged when she was still quite ill, and I have tried to help her back up.
DARWIN
That’s very good.
BROCK
Well …
DARWIN
Second marriage, of course. Often stabilizes.
BROCK
What?
DARWIN
The chap in Brussels.
BROCK
Ah yes.
DARWIN
You don’t have to be ashamed …
BROCK
No, I’m not, it’s …
DARWIN
In the diplomatic service it isn’t as if a mad wife is any kind of professional advantage. On the contrary, it almost guarantees promotion.
BROCK
Well …
DARWIN
Some of the senior men, their wives are absolutely barking. I take the word ‘gouache’ to be the giveaway. When they start drifting out of rooms saying, ‘I think I’ll just go and do my gouaches dear,’ then you know you’ve lost them for good and all.
BROCK
But Susan isn’t mad.
DARWIN
No, no.
BROCK
In the other room.
DARWIN
I knew there had to be. Somehow. And no doubt culturally inclined. Traditional dance, she’ll tell us about, in the highlands of Burma. Or the plot of Lohengrin.
BROCK
Leonard …
DARWIN
I’m sorry. I think I’ve had it, Brock. One more Aung and I throw in the can.
BROCK
What?
DARWIN
The maraschinos. I’m so hungry. It’s all those bloody drugs we have to take.
BROCK
Let me …
DARWIN
Stay.
BROCK
Who told you that?
DARWIN
Last week the Foreign Secretary went abroad. I was not briefed. We believe he met with the French and the Israelis, urged the Israelis to attack. I believe our ultimatum was written in France last week, hence the mistake in the wording. The Israelis had reckoned to reach the canal, but met with unexpectedly heavy resistance. I think the entire war is a fraud cooked up by the British as an excuse for seizing the canal. And we, we who have to execute this policy, even we were not told.
BROCK
Well … what difference does it make?
DARWIN
My dear boy.
BROCK
I mean it.
DARWIN
Raymond.
BROCK
It makes no difference.
DARWIN
I was lied to.
BROCK
Yes, but you were against it from the start.
DARWIN
I …
BROCK
Oh come on, we all were. The Foreign Office hated the operation from the very first mention, so what difference does it make now?
DARWIN
All the difference in the world.
BROCK
None at all.
DARWIN
The government lied to me.
BROCK
If the policy was wrong, if it was wrong to begin with …
DARWIN
They are not in good faith.
BROCK
I see, I see, so what you’re saying is, the British may do anything, doesn’t matter how murderous, doesn’t matter how silly, just so long as we do it in good faith.
DARWIN
Yes. I would have defended it, I wouldn’t have minded how damn stupid it was. I would have defended it had it been honestly done. But this time we are cowboys and when the English are the cowboys, then in truth I fear for the future of the globe.
SUSAN
Mme Aung has been enthralling us with the story of the new Bergman film at the Everyman.
DARWIN
Ah.
BROCK
Ah yes.
SUSAN
Apparently it’s about depression, isn’t that so, Mme Aung?
MME AUNG
I do feel the Norwegians are very good at that sort of thing.
SUSAN
Is anything wrong?
BROCK
It’s all right.
SUSAN
They were probably drafting a telegram …
BROCK
We weren’t …
SUSAN
That’s what they do before they drop a bomb. They send their targets notice in a telegram. Bombs tonight, evacuate the area. Now what does that indicate to you, M. Aung?
BROCK
Susan, please.
SUSAN
I’ll tell you what it indicates to me. Bad conscience. They don’t even have the guts to make a war any more.
DARWIN
Perhaps Mme Aung will tell us the story of the film. This is something I’d be very keen to hear.
MME AUNG
I feel the ladies have already …
ALICE
We don’t mind.
SUSAN
It’s all right. Go ahead. We like the bit in the mental ward.
MME AUNG
Ah yes.
SUSAN
Raymond will like it. You got me at the Maudsley, didn’t you dear?
BROCK
Yes, yes.
SUSAN
That’s where he proposed to me. A moment of weakness. Of mine, I mean.
BROCK
Please, darling …
SUSAN
I married him because he reminded me of my father.
MME AUNG
Really?
SUSAN
At that point, of course, I didn’t realize just what a shit my father was.
ALICE
I’m sorry. She has a sort of psychiatric cabaret.
SUSAN
That’s very good. And there’s something about Suez which …
BROCK
Will you please be quiet?
MME AUNG
There’s a woman … who despises her husband …
SUSAN
Is it getting a little bit chilly in here? October nights. Those poor parachutists. I do know how they feel. Even now. Cities. Fields. Trees. Farms. Dark spaces. Lights. The parachute opens. We descend.
BROCK
Please can you stop, can you stop fucking talking for five fucking minutes on end?
SUSAN
I would stop, I would stop, I would stop fucking talking if I ever heard anyone else say anything worth fucking stopping talking for.
DARWIN
I’m sorry. I apologize. I really must go.
AUNG
We are behind you, sir. There is wisdom in your expedition.
DARWIN
Thank you.
AUNG
May I say, sir, these gyps need whipping and you are the man to do it?
DARWIN
Thank you very much. Mme Aung.
MME AUNG
We never really met.
DARWIN
No. No. We never met, that is true. But perhaps before I go, I may nevertheless set you right on a point of fact. Ingmar Bergman is not a bloody Norwegian, he is a bloody Swede. Good night, everyone.
BROCK
He’s going to resign.
SUSAN
Isn’t this an exciting week? Don’t you think? Isn’t this thrilling? Don’t you think? Everything is up for grabs. At last. We will see some changes. Thank the Lord. Now, there was dinner. I made some more dinner for Leonard. A little ham. And chicken. And some pickles and tomato. And lettuce. And there are a couple of pheasants in the fridge. And I can get twelve bottles of claret from the cellar. Why not?
PRIEST
Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery. He cometh up and is cut down like a flower. He fleeth and never continueth in one stay. In the midst of life we are in death. Of whom may we seek for succour but of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased?
BROCK
I must say, I’d forgotten just how grim it can be.
ALICE
All that mumbling.
BROCK
I know. And those bloody hymns. They really do you no good at all. Would you like to sit down in here? I’m afraid the whole house is horribly unused.
ALICE
I hope you didn’t mind …
BROCK
Not at all.
ALICE
… my bringing Dorcas along.
BROCK
She swelled the numbers.
DORCAS
I had the afternoon off school.
BROCK
I’m not sure I’d have chosen a funeral …
DORCAS
It was fine.
BROCK
Oh good.
DORCAS
Alice told me that you were very good friends …
BROCK
Well, we are.
DORCAS
… who she hadn’t seen for a very long time and she was sure you wouldn’t mind me … you know …
BROCK
Gatecrashing?
DORCAS
Yes.
BROCK
At the grave.
DORCAS
It sounds awful.
BROCK
You were welcome as far as I was concerned.
DORCAS
The only thing was … I never heard his name.
BROCK
His name was Darwin.
DORCAS
Ah.
SUSAN
Please, nobody get up for me.
BROCK
Ah Susan …
SUSAN
I was just looking out some more books to take back.
BROCK
Are you all right?
SUSAN
Yes, fine.
ALICE
Susan, this is Dorcas I told you about.
SUSAN
How do you do?
DORCAS
How do you do?
ALICE
I teach Dorcas history.
BROCK
Good Lord, how long have you done that?
ALICE
Oh … I’ve been at it some time.
DORCAS
Alice is a very good teacher, you know.
BROCK
I’m sure.
ALICE
Thank you, Dorcas.
DORCAS
We had a poll and Alice came top.
ALICE
Ta.
BROCK
Where do you teach?
ALICE
It’s called the Kensington Academy.
BROCK
I see.
ALICE
It’s in Shepherd’s Bush.
DORCAS
It’s a crammer.
ALICE
For the daughters of the rich and the congenitally stupid. Dorcas to a T.
DORCAS
It’s true.
ALICE
There’s almost nothing that a teacher can do.
DORCAS
Alice says we’re all the prisoners of our genes.
ALICE
When you actually try to engage their attention, you know that all they can really hear inside their heads is the great thump-thump of their ancestors fucking too freely among themselves.
DORCAS
Nothing wrong with that.
ALICE
No?
DORCAS
Stupid people are happier.
ALICE
Is that what you think?
BROCK
Well …
SUSAN
Raymond, could you manage to make us some tea?
BROCK
Certainly, if there’s time …
SUSAN
I’m sure everyone’s in need of it.
ALICE
I didn’t realize you were going back so soon.
SUSAN
It’s a problem, I’m afraid. My husband is a diplomat. We’re posted in Iran. I haven’t been to London for over three years. Then when I heard of Leonard’s death I felt … I just felt very strongly I wanted to attend.
DORCAS
Alice was saying he’d lost a lot of his friends.
SUSAN
Yes, that’s true.
DORCAS
I didn’t understand what …
SUSAN
He spoke his mind over Suez. In public. He didn’t hide his disgust. A lot of people never forgave him for that.
DORCAS
Oh I see.
ALICE
It’s a historical incident four years ago, caused a minor kind of stir at the time. It’s also the name of a waterway in Egypt. Egypt is the big brown country up the top right-hand corner of Africa. Africa is a continent …
DORCAS
Yes, thank you.
ALICE
And that’s why nobody was there today.
SUSAN
Yes.
ALICE
Anything, count the bricks, count the trees, but don’t think about death … So I tried to imagine Leonard was still alive, I mean locked in his coffin but still alive. And I was laughing at how he would have dealt with the situation, I mean just exactly what the protocol would be.
SUSAN
He would know it.
ALICE
Of course. Official procedure in the case of being buried alive. How many times one may tap on the lid. How to rise from the grave without drawing unnecessary attention to yourself.
SUSAN
Poor Leonard.
ALICE
I know. But he did make me laugh.
SUSAN
Alice said I might help you in some way.
DORCAS
Well, yes.
SUSAN
Of course. If there’s anything at all.
DORCAS
Did she tell you what the problem was?
ALICE
There isn’t any problem. You need money, that’s all.
DORCAS
Alice said you’d once been a great friend of hers, part of her sort of crowd …
SUSAN
Are they still going then?
ALICE
They certainly are.
DORCAS
And that you might be sympathetic as you’d … well … as you’d known some troubles yourself …
ALICE
Dorcas needs cash from an impeccable source.
SUSAN
I see.
DORCAS
I’d pay it back.
SUSAN
Well, I’m sure.
DORCAS
I mean it’s only two hundred pounds. In theory I could still get it for myself, perhaps I’ll have to, but Alice felt …
ALICE
Never mind.
DORCAS
No, I think I should, I mean, I think I should say Alice did feel as she’d introduced me to this man …
SUSAN
Yes.
DORCAS
I mean, I am seventeen. And I knew what I was doing. So why the hell should Alice feel responsible?
SUSAN
I don’t know.
DORCAS
Anyway the man was a doctor, one of Alice’s famous bent doctors, you know, I just wanted to get hold of some drugs, but he wouldn’t hand over unless I agreed to fool around, so I just … I didn’t think anything of it …
SUSAN
No.
DORCAS
It just seemed like part of the price. At the time. Of course I never guessed it would be three months later and, wham, the knitting needles.
SUSAN
Yes.
DORCAS
I mean, to be honest I could still go to Daddy and tell him. Just absolutely outright tell him. Just say, Daddy I’m sorry but …
ALICE
Wham the knitting needles.
DORCAS
Yes.
SUSAN
Well, I’m sure it needn’t delay us for too long …
DORCAS
Do you mean …
SUSAN
Kill a child. That’s easy. No problem at all.
BROCK
I have to tell you the car has arrived.
SUSAN
Oh good.
BROCK
The driver is saying we must get away at once.
DORCAS
I thought you said they …
ALICE
It’s another name for Iran.
DORCAS
Oh I see.
BROCK
Susan I do hope you’re preparing to go.
SUSAN
I will do, I just need a minute or two …
BROCK
I don’t think we have time to do anything but …
SUSAN
I do need some tea. Just to wash down my pill.
BROCK
Yes, of course.
ALICE
So, Raymond, you must tell us about life in Iran.
BROCK
I would say we’d been very happy out there. Wouldn’t you, Susan?
SUSAN
Uh-huh.
BROCK
I think the peace has done us both a great deal of good. We were getting rather frenzied in our last few months here.
ALICE
And the people?
BROCK
The people are fine. In so far as one’s seen them, you know. It’s only occasionally that you manage to get out. But the trips are startling, no doubt about that. There you are.
ALICE
Thank you.
BROCK
The sky. The desert. And of course the poverty. Living among people who have to struggle so hard. It can make you see life very differently.
SUSAN
Do I make it to cash?
ALICE
If you could.
DORCAS
Thanks.
BROCK
I do remember Leonard, that Leonard always said, the pleasure of diplomacy is perspective, you see. Looking across distances. For instance, we see England very clearly from there. And it does look just a trifle decadent.
SUSAN
I’m lending Dorcas some money.
BROCK
Oh really, is that wise?
ALICE
She needs an operation.
BROCK
What?
ALICE
The tendons of her hands. If she’s ever to play in a concert hall again.
BROCK
Do you actually play a …
SUSAN
Raymond, could you take a look at that case? One of those locks is refusing to turn.
BROCK
Ah yes.
SUSAN
Here you are.
DORCAS
Thank you.
SUSAN
Don’t thank us. We’re rotten with cash.
BROCK
If that’s it, then I reckon we’re ready to go. I’m sorry to turn you out of the house …
ALICE
That’s all right.
BROCK
Alice, you must come and see us …
ALICE
I shall.
BROCK
My tour has been extended another two years. Dorcas, I’m happy to have met. I hope your studies proceed, under Alice’s tutelage. In the meantime perhaps you might lend me a hand … Susan’s lifeline. Her case full of books.
SUSAN
Yes, I am.
BROCK
You’ll follow me down?
DORCAS
Alice, we won’t be long will we?
ALICE
No.
DORCAS
It’s just it’s biology tonight and that’s my favourite, Do I put them in the boot?
BROCK
If you could.
SUSAN
I knew if I came over I would never return.
BROCK
Susan. Darling. Are we ready to go?
VOICE
You were one of the few women to be flown into France?
SUSAN
Yes.
VOICE
And one of the youngest?
SUSAN
Yes.
VOICE
Did you always have complete confidence in the organization that sent you?
SUSAN
Yes, of course.
VOICE
Since the war it’s frequently been alleged that Special Operations was amateurish, its recruitment methods were haphazard, some of its behaviour was rather cavalier. Did you feel that at the time?
SUSAN
Not at all.
VOICE
The suggestion is that it was careless of human life. Did you feel that any of your colleagues died needlessly?
SUSAN
I can’t say.
VOICE
If you were to …
SUSAN
Sorry, if I could …
VOICE
By all means.
SUSAN
You believed in the organization. You had to. If you didn’t, you would die.
VOICE
But you must have had an opinion …
SUSAN
No. I had no opinion. I have an opinion now.
VOICE
And that is?
SUSAN
That it was one part of the war from which the British emerge with the greatest possible valour and distinction.
VOICE
Do you ever get together with former colleagues and talk about the war?
SUSAN
Never. We aren’t clubbable.
BEGLEY
Mrs Brock, Sir Andrew will see you now. He only has a few minutes, I’m afraid.
CHARLESON
Ah Mrs Brock.
SUSAN
Sir Andrew.
CHARLESON
How do you do?
SUSAN
That’s right.
CHARLESON
The Queen’s Garden Party. And I’ve heard you on the wireless recently. Talking about the war. How extraordinary it must have been.
SUSAN
This must seem a very strange request.
CHARLESON
Not in the slightest. We’re delighted to see you here.
SUSAN
If you are having one.
CHARLESON
Unfortunately not. I’m somewhat liverish.
SUSAN
I’m sorry.
CHARLESON
No, no, it’s a hazard of the job. Half the diplomats I know have bad offal, I’m afraid. If you could leave us, Begley.
BEGLEY
Sir.
CHARLESON
Just shuffle some papers for a while.
SUSAN
Sir Andrew, as you know I take very little part in my husband’s professional life …
CHARLESON
Indeed.
SUSAN
Normally, I spend a great deal of time on my own … with one or two friends … of my own … Mostly I like reading, I like reading alone … I do think to be merely your husband’s wife is demeaning for a woman of any integrity at all …
CHARLESON
I understand.
SUSAN
But I find for the first time in my husband’s career I am beginning to feel some need to intervene.
CHARLESON
I had a message, yes.
SUSAN
I hope you appreciate my loyalty …
CHARLESON
Oh yes.
SUSAN
Coming here at all. Brock is a man who has seen me through some very difficult times …
CHARLESON
I am told.
SUSAN
But this is a matter on which I need to go behind his back.
CHARLESON
I’m the Chief Clerk, yes …
SUSAN
I’ve come to ask exactly what my husband’s prospects are.
CHARLESON
Yes.
SUSAN
Brock has been allocated to a fairly lowly job, backing up the EEC negotiating team …
CHARLESON
He’s part of the push into Europe, yes.
SUSAN
The foreign posts he’s since been offered have not been glittering.
CHARLESON
We offered him Monrovia.
SUSAN
Monrovia. Yes. He took that to be an insult. Was he wrong?
CHARLESON
Monrovia is not an insult.
SUSAN
But?
CHARLESON
Monrovia is more in the nature of a test. A test of nerve, it’s true. If a man is stupid enough to accept Monrovia, then he probably deserves Monrovia. That is how we think.
SUSAN
But you …
CHARLESON
And Brock refused. Had we wanted to insult him there are far worse jobs. In this building too. In my view town-twinning is the coup de grâce. I’d far rather be a martyr to the tsetse fly than have to twin Rotherham with Bergen-op-Zoom.
SUSAN
You are evading me.
CHARLESON
I’m sorry. It’s a habit, as you say.
SUSAN
I see.
CHARLESON
Everyone is streamed, a slow stream, a fast stream …
SUSAN
My husband is slow?
CHARLESON
Slowish.
SUSAN
That means …
CHARLESON
What is he? First Secretary struggling towards Counsellor. At forty-one it’s not remarkable, you know.
SUSAN
But it’s got worse.
CHARLESON
You think?
SUSAN
The last six months. He’s never felt excluded from his work before.
CHARLESON
Does he feel that?
SUSAN
I think you know he does.
CHARLESON
Well, I’m sure the intention was not to punish him. We have had some trouble in placing him, it’s true. The rather startling decision to desert his post …
SUSAN
That was not his fault.
CHARLESON
We were told. We were sympathetic. Psychiatric reasons?
SUSAN
I was daunted at the prospect of returning to Iran.
CHARLESON
Of course. Persian psychiatry. I shudder at the thought. A heavy-handed people at the best of times. We understood. Family problems. Our sympathy goes out …
SUSAN
But you are blocking his advance.
CHARLESON
I think you should understand the basis of our talk. The basis on which I agreed to talk. You asked for information. The information is this
SUSAN
I’m very keen he should not suffer on my account.
CHARLESON
Mrs Brock, believe me I recognize your tone. Women have come in here and used it before.
SUSAN
I would like to see my husband advance.
CHARLESON
I also have read the stories in your file, so nothing in your manner is likely to amaze. I do know exactly the kind of person you are. When you have chosen a particular course … When there is something which you very badly want … But in this matter I must tell you, Mrs Brock, it is more than likely you have met your match.
SUSAN
You are saying …
CHARLESON
I am saying that certain qualities are valued here above a simple gift of being right or wrong. Qualities sometimes hard to define …
SUSAN
What you are saying is that nobody may speak, nobody may question …
CHARLESON
Certainly tact is valued very high.
SUSAN
Sir Andrew, do you never find it in yourself to despise a profession in which nobody may speak their mind?
CHARLESON
That is the nature of the service, Mrs Brock. It is called diplomacy. And in its practice the English lead the world. The irony is this
SUSAN
I must thank you for your frankness, Sir Andrew …
CHARLESON
Not at all.
SUSAN
I must, however, warn you of my plan. If Brock is not promoted in the next six days, I am intending to shoot myself.
SUSAN
I’m due at a reception for Australia Day.
CHARLESON
Begley.
SUSAN
I always like to see just how rude I can be. Not that the Australians ever notice, of course. So it does become a sort of Zen sport, don’t you think?
CHARLESON
John, I wonder, could you give me a hand?
BEGLEY
Sir.
SUSAN
Ah the side-kick, the placid young man, now where have I seen that character before?
CHARLESON
If we could take Mrs Brock down to the surgery …
SUSAN
I assure you, Sir Andrew, I’m perfectly all right.
CHARLESON
Perhaps alert her husband …
BEGLEY
If you’re not feeling well …
SUSAN
People will be waiting at Australia House. I can’t let them down. It will be packed with angry people all searching for me, saying where is she, what a let-down. I only came here to be insulted and now there’s no chance.
CHARLESON
I think it would be better if you …
SUSAN
Please. Please leave me alone.
BROCK
Well, I suppose it isn’t too bad. Perhaps we’ll keep going another couple of years. A regime of mineral water and lightly browned toast.
ALICE
She paces around.
BROCK
I told her this morning … we’ll have to sell the house. I’m sure we can cope in a smaller sort of flat. Especially now we don’t have to entertain.
ALICE
Nothing. She’s just moving about.
BROCK
Perhaps you’d enjoy to take the evening off. I’m happy to do duty for an hour or two.
ALICE
I enjoy it. I get to do my work. A good long slog for my charity appeal. And I’ve rather fallen out with all those people I knew. And most of them go off on the Aldermaston March.
BROCK
Really? Of course. Easter weekend.
ALICE
Except for Alistair and I’ve no intention of spending an evening with him – or her, as he’s taken to calling himself.
BROCK
How come?
ALICE
Apparently he’s just had his penis removed.
BROCK
Voluntarily? It’s what he intended, I mean?
ALICE
I believe. In Morocco. And replaced with a sort of pink plastic envelope. I haven’t seen it. He says he keeps the shopping list in there, tucks five pound notes away, so he says.
BROCK
I thought that strange young girl of yours would ring.
ALICE
No, no. She decided to move on. There’s some appalling politician, I’m told. On the paedophiliac wing of the Tory party. She’s going to spend the summer swabbing the deck on his yacht. Pleasuring his enormous underside. It’s what she always wanted. The fat. The inane.
BROCK
Looking back, I seem to have been eating all the time. My years in the Foreign Service, I mean. I don’t think I missed a single canapé. Not one. The silver tray flashed and bang, I was there.
ALICE
Do you miss it?
BROCK
Almost all the time. There’s not much glamour in insurance, you know.
ALICE
You chose it.
BROCK
That’s right. That isn’t so strange. The strange bit is always … why I remain.
ALICE
Eight hundred addresses, eight hundred names …
BROCK
You were never attracted? A regular job?
ALICE
I never had time. Too busy relating to various young men. Falling in and out of love turns out to be like any other career.
BROCK
You speak as if it’s over.
ALICE
I’ve no doubt it is.
BROCK
How long since anyone took a look next door?
ALICE
That’s why I think it may be time to do good.
SUSAN
I need to ask you to move out of here. I am in temporary need of this room. You can go wherever you like. And pretty soon also … you’re welcome to return.
BROCK
You’d better tell me, Susan, what you’ve done to your hands.
SUSAN
I’ve just been taking some paper from the wall.
BROCK
There’s blood.
SUSAN
A fingernail.
BROCK
Susan, what have you actually done?
SUSAN
I thought as we were going to get rid of the house … and I couldn’t stand any of the things that were there …
BROCK
Could you look in the drawer please, Alice, there’s some Nembutal …
ALICE
I’m not sure we should …
BROCK
I shan’t ask you again.
SUSAN
You yourself said it, I’ve often heard you say, it’s money that did it, it’s money that rots. That we’ve all lived like camels off the fat in our humps. Well, then, isn’t the best thing to do … to turn round simply and give the house away?
ALICE
Well, I …
SUSAN
Don’t your women need a place to live?
BROCK
I suppose you conspired.
ALICE
Not at all.
BROCK
Well, really?
ALICE
That was the first that I’ve heard.
BROCK
In that case, please, you might give me some help. Find out what else she’s been doing out there.
SUSAN
Cutlery, crockery, lampshades and books, books, books. Encyclopedias. Clutter. Meaningless. A universe of things.
BROCK
Which is the braver? To live as I do? Or never, ever to face life like you?
SUSAN
Alice, would your women value my clothes?
ALICE
Well, I …
SUSAN
It sounds fairly silly. I have thirteen evening dresses, though.
BROCK
Susan.
SUSAN
Obviously not much use as they are. But possibly they could be recut. Resewn?
BROCK
Your life is selfish, self-interested gain. That’s the most charitable interpretation to hand. You claim to be protecting some personal ideal, always at a cost of almost infinite pain to everyone around you. You are selfish, brutish, unkind. Jealous of other people’s happiness as well, determined to destroy other ways of happiness they find. I’ve spent fifteen years of my life trying to help you, simply trying to be kind, and my great comfort has been that I am waiting for some indication from you … some sign that you have valued this kindness of mine. Some love perhaps. Insane.
AND YET
that in the life you have led you have utterly failed, failed in the very, very heart of your life. Admit it. Then perhaps you might really move on.
SUSAN
Well.
ALICE
Susan, I think you should get out of this house.
SUSAN
Of course.
ALICE
I’ll help you. Any way I can.
SUSAN
Well, that’s very kind.
ALICE
If you …
SUSAN
I’ll be going just as soon as this job is done.
ALICE
Listen, if Raymond really means what he says …
SUSAN
Really, Alice, I shouldn’t need to ask. It’s a very sad day when one can’t help the poor …
ALICE
For God’s sake, Susan, he’ll put you in the bin.
SUSAN
Don’t be silly, Alice, it’s Easter weekend. It must have occurred to you … the doctor’s away.
ALICE
Yes. Yes, of course. I’m going, I’m just on my way.
SUSAN
Now, Raymond. Good. Let’s look at this thing.
LAZAR
Susan. Susan. Feel who I am.
SUSAN
I know. I know who you are. How could you be anyone else but Lazar?
LAZAR
Don’t take your clothes off whatever you do.
SUSAN
Of course not.
LAZAR
That would spoil it hopelessly for me.
SUSAN
I’m getting my cigarettes. I roll my own …
LAZAR
Goodness me.
SUSAN
Tell you, there are no fucking flies on me.
LAZAR
I am glad I found you.
SUSAN
I’m just glad I came.
LAZAR
This place is filthy.
SUSAN
It’s a cheap hotel.
LAZAR
They seem to serve you dust on almost everything.
SUSAN
You should be grateful for dust, did you know? If it weren’t for all the dust in the atmosphere, human beings would be killed by the heat of the sun.
LAZAR
In Blackpool?
SUSAN
Well …
LAZAR
Are you kidding me?
SUSAN
I was given some grass. Shall I roll it in?
LAZAR
Just the simple cigarette for me.
SUSAN
Don’t tell me any more.
LAZAR
Susan …
SUSAN
I left it weeks ago.
LAZAR
I know. I gather you’ve been out on the road. But … I went, I went round and saw the man.
SUSAN
And how was he?
LAZAR
He looked like a man who’d spent his life with you.
SUSAN
How can you say that?
LAZAR
Oh I’m guessing, that’s all.
SUSAN
Oh really? That’s my fault. I gave the house away.
LAZAR
He said he’d had to fight to get back into his home. There’d been some kind of trouble. Police, violence it seems …
SUSAN
Was he angry?
LAZAR
Angry? No. He just seemed very sorry not to be with you.
SUSAN
Listen. I have to tell you I’ve not always been well. I have a weakness. I like to lose control. I’ve been letting it happen, well, a number of times …
LAZAR
Is it …?
SUSAN
I did shoot someone about ten years ago.
LAZAR
Did you hurt him?
SUSAN
Fortunately no. At least that’s what we kept telling him, you know. Raymond went and gave him money in notes. He slapped them like hot poultices all over his wounds. I think it did finally convince him on the whole. It was after Raymond’s kindness I felt I had to get engaged …
LAZAR
Why do people …
SUSAN
Marry? I don’t know. Are you …
LAZAR
What? Ask me anything at all.
SUSAN
No. It’s nothing. I don’t want to know.
LAZAR
Do you ever see him?
SUSAN
Good gracious no. I’ve stripped away everything, everything I’ve known. There’s only one kind of dignity, that’s in living alone. The clothes you stand up in, the world you can see …
LAZAR
Oh Susan …
SUSAN
Don’t.
SUSAN
How long till dawn? Do you think we should go? If we wait till morning we’ll have to pay the bill. I can’t believe that can be the right thing to do.
LAZAR
I don’t know what I’d expected.
SUSAN
Mmm?
LAZAR
What I’d hoped for, at the time I returned. Some sort of edge to the life that I lead. Some sort of feeling their death was worthwhile.
SUSAN
Lazar, I’m sorry. I’m just about to go.
LAZAR
What?
SUSAN
I’ve eaten nothing. So I just go …
LAZAR
I hate, I hate this life that we lead.
SUSAN
Oh, God, here I go.
LAZAR
A fine undercover agent will move so that nobody can ever tell he was there.
SUSAN
Tell me your name.
LAZAR
Code name.
FRENCHMAN
Bonjour, ma’moiselle.
SUSAN
Bonjour.
FRENCHMAN
Vous regardez le village?
SUSAN
Oui, je suis montée la colline pour mieux voir. C’est merveilleux.
FRENCHMAN
Oui. Indeed the day is fine.
SUSAN
‘I climbed the hill to get a better view.’ I’ve only spoken French for months on end.
FRENCHMAN
You are English?
SUSAN
Just so.
FRENCHMAN
You join the party in the village?
SUSAN
Soon. I’m hoping, yes, I’m very keen to go.
FRENCHMAN
Myself I work. A farmer. Like any other day. The Frenchman works or starves. He is the piss. The shit. The lowest of the low.
SUSAN
Look. They’re lighting fires in the square. And children … coming out with burning sticks.
FRENCHMAN
The harvest is not good again this year.
SUSAN
I’m sorry.
FRENCHMAN
As I expect. The land is very poor. I have to work each moment of the day.
SUSAN
But you’ll be glad I think. You’re glad as well?
FRENCHMAN
I’m glad. Is something good, is true. The English … have no feelings, yes? Are stiff.
SUSAN
They hide them, hide them from the world.
FRENCHMAN
Is stupid.
SUSAN
Stupid, yes. It may be …
FRENCHMAN
Huh?
SUSAN
That things will quickly change. We have grown up. We will improve our world.
FRENCHMAN
The walk is down the hill.
SUSAN
My friend.
