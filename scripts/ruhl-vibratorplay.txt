MRS. GIVINGS
Look baby, it’s light! No candle, no rusty tool to snuff it out, but light, pure light, straight from man’s imagination into our living room. On, off, on, off, on—
She turns it off and on.
MRS. GIVINGS
Hello.
DR. GIVINGS
Sorry. Hello, darling.
In the operating theater, Annie changes the sheets on the examining table.
MRS. GIVINGS
Hello!
MRS. GIVINGS
I’ll find you a nurse who hasn’t a child of her own. Not that I hope to find a nurse with a dead baby for that is tragic nothing is more tragic oh it hurts me here to think it—you in your pram not moving—but I suppose if I am to find a childless nurse with milk to spare, her baby must be dead, and recently dead, oh dear. I don’t like to think of that.
DR. GIVINGS
I have a new patient who might ring the doorbell any second. If she arrives, would you please let Annie answer the door.
DR. GIVINGS
Her nerves are terribly raw and it might throw off the entire clinical balance for her to meet you and the baby.
ANNIE
Hello, you must be Mr. and Mrs. Daldry, please come in.
This way, let me show you to the operating theater—
ANNIE
Well let’s just call it the next room for now, shall we, don’t be nervous, Mrs. Daldry.
Shall I just put your hat here?
MR. DALDRY
She’s very sensitive to light.
ANNIE
Dr. Givings enters from the living room and overhears this last remark. Annie turns off the electric lamp.
She leads them to the office.
DR. GIVINGS
So nice to meet you, Mrs. Daldry, Mr. Daldry. Shall I take your coat?
Mrs. Daldry shakes her head.
MR. DALDRY
She’s very sensitive to cold.
DR. GIVINGS
I see. Well, have a seat. Sensitive to light, sensitive to cold—
MRS. DALDRY
Oh, is there a baby here? I didn’t know there was a new baby. How wonderful for you.
DR. GIVINGS
Yes. Could you shut the door please Annie?
DR. GIVINGS
What other symptoms is your wife suffering from?
MR. DALDRY
I find her weeping at odd moments during the day, muttering about green curtains or some such nonsense.
DR. GIVINGS
Is it nonsense, Mrs. Daldry?
MRS. DALDRY
I suppose it is. The green curtains give me terrible headache. The color. Old ghosts in the dark.
DR. GIVINGS
Tell me more about the curtains, would you?
MRS. DALDRY
The house where I grew up my mother would wash the curtains every week, she beat them with a stick, and there were no ghosts in them. There was a beautiful view of a grape arbor and when the curtains were cleaned you could see right through to the grapes, you could almost watch them growing, they got so plump in the autumn. My mother would make loads of jam—my mother was not a nervous or excitable woman. It was jam, it was laughing, and long walks out of doors. We haven’t a grape arbor here—I am full of digressions these days Dr. Givings—but the point is I haven’t the strength to wash the curtains every week and beat
the ghosts out of them. You think I am talking like a madwoman but if you could see the curtains you would see that I really am very logical. They’re horrible.
DR. GIVINGS
And you have tried the usual remedies, rest and relaxation?
MRS. DALDRY
I do nothing but rest! Yes. Nothing but rest!
MR. DALDRY
When I met Mrs. Daldry she was seventeen. She was an extra- ordinary creature. She played the piano. We ate grape jam in the arbor and there I told her I wanted to take care of her and protect her forever, didn’t I.
MRS. DALDRY
Yes.
Now I am afraid there is very little sympathy between us.
MRS. DALDRY
I am breaking his heart—. He likes me to be a certain way. Perhaps if I could play the piano again but my fingers will not work.
MR. DALDRY
No, her fingers do not work. In the living room. Or in any other room, if you take my meaning, Dr. Givings.
MRS. DALDRY
Mr. Daldry please do not embarrass me with such vulgarities. I am shocked and disgusted and I will leave the room now.
DR. GIVINGS
Mr. Daldry, your wife is suffering from hysteria. It is a very clear case. I recommend theraputic electrical massage—weekly— possibly daily, we shall see—sessions. We need to relieve the pressure of her nerves.
You will soon have your blooming wife back, she will regain her color, light and cold will no longer have the same effect on her. You will soon be eating grape jam and wondering how it is that Mrs. Daldry looks so much like a seventeen year old.
MR. DALDRY
Thank you Dr. Givings. You have no idea what a source of anguish my wife’s illness has been to me. And to her, of course.
DR. GIVINGS
Of course. I will have her back for you in an hour’s time.
MR. DALDRY
Thank you, Doctor.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Givings has reentered the living room with the baby.
MRS. DALDRY
This lamp is extraordinary. It hurts my eyes to watch it go on and off but I enjoy the pain.
It is a kind of religious ecstasy to feel half blind,
do you not think?
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes, isn’t it?
I was not supposed to meet you
but I’m glad I have.
I hope you find my husband to be a comfort, I know that I do.
MRS. DALDRY
May I hold your baby?
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes, of course.
DR. GIVINGS
I would ask you to leave Mrs. Daldry here while you take a walk around the grounds. Perhaps it’s better if you don’t disturb her now, Mr. Daldry.
MR. DALDRY
Of course. Whatever you think best, Doctor.
MRS. DALDRY
What is the baby’s name?
MRS. GIVINGS
Letitia. Lotty for short.
Three syllables seemed like too many for a baby.
MRS. DALDRY
Lotty.
ANNIE
The doctor is ready for you now. mrs. daldry
Oh, no must I go back in there? I would rather hold the baby.
MR. DALDRY
Be a good girl.
MRS. DALDRY
Isn’t she? Too skinny though.
MR. DALDRY
The doctor is waiting, Sabrina.
MRS. GIVINGS
You’ll be just fine. My husband is a good doctor. Or so I’ve been told.
If you’ll excuse me, it’s time for her nap.
DR. GIVINGS
Now then, Mrs. Daldry, I would ask you to remove your clothing but you may keep your underthings on. Please remove your corset, if you would. Annie will place a sheet over your lower regions. We will respect your modesty in every particular.
MR. DALDRY
Hello. They are trying to get rid of me. I am supposed to walk about the grounds.
MRS. GIVINGS
But is it not raining, Mr—?
MR. DALDRY
Daldry.
I don’t know.
MRS. GIVINGS
Your name?
MR. DALDRY
No. If it is raining.
Then you will have to gamble on whether or not to take an umbrella.
MR. DALDRY
Indeed.
MRS. GIVINGS
There are three kinds of people. Those who use umbrellas when it is not raining; those who do not use umbrellas even when it is raining; and those who use umbrellas only and precisely while it rains. Which kind are you, Mr. Daldry?
MR. DALDRY
I use an umbrella while it is raining.
MRS. GIVINGS
That’s too bad. I find people who do not use umbrellas while it is raining horribly romantic. Strolling, no striding, through the rain, with wet hair, looking at a drop of water on a branch.
MR. DALDRY
My wife is one of those. Oh yes! I could see that.
It’s damned annoying. I always worry she’ll catch cold.
MRS. GIVINGS
But horribly romantic. My husband opens his umbrella at the merest hint of rain. And even if it does not rain, he will leave it open, stubborn as an ox, and keep walking. My husband is a scientist.
MR. DALDRY
And what sort of person are you, Mrs. Givings?
MRS. GIVINGS
Why, I don’t know. My husband has always held the umbrella. Isn’t that funny. I don’t know at all what kind of person I am.
MRS. GIVINGS
I’ll show you the grounds and we can use this very large umbrella and perhaps I will hold it and we shall see what kind of person I am. I only hope you do not get wet.
It sounds like a madcap adventure.
DR. GIVINGS
Are you ready for me?
ANNIE
Yes, Dr. Givings.
DR. GIVINGS
Are you warm enough?
Mrs. Daldry, we are going to produce in you what is called a paroxysm. The congestion in your womb is causing your hysterical symptoms and if we can release some of that congestion and invite the juices downward your health will be restored.
Thanks to the dawn of electricity—yes, thank you Mr. Edison, I always tip my hat to Mr. Edison—a great American—I have a new instrument which I will use. It used to be that it would take me or it would take Annie—oh—hours—to produce a paroxysm in our patients and it demanded quite a lot of skill and patience. It was much like a child’s game—trying to pat the head and rub the stomach at the same time—but thanks to this new electricial instrument we shall be done in a matter of minutes.
MRS. DALDRY
I—I’m afraid I don’t—
DR. GIVINGS
Three minutes, sometimes five at the outer limits. Are you ready Mrs. Daldry?
MRS. DALDRY
I am frightened.
DR. GIVINGS
Don’t be frightened.
MRS. DALDRY
There is no danger of being electrocuted?
DR. GIVINGS
None at all.
MRS. DALDRY
He puts his arm under the sheets and holds the vibrator to her private parts.
DR. GIVINGS
I will tell you an amusing story. Dr. Benjamin Franklin once decided to electrocute a bird for his turkey dinner on Christmas Eve. But, by mistake, he held onto the chain, completing the circuit, and couldn’t let go. He described violently convulsing until he was able by sheer force of will to let go of the chain. He was perfectly fine! Do you feel calmer?
MRS. DALDRY
A little.
DR. GIVINGS
This will just take a matter of minutes.
DR. GIVINGS
It’s all right, Mrs. Daldry. That’s just fine.
Annie will hold your hand.
MRS. DALDRY
Oh, God in His Heaven
DR. GIVINGS
That was very good, Mrs. Daldry. Is not this new instrument wonderful? Thank goodness for Benjamin Franklin and his electrical key! Did you know they electrocuted an elephant in Coney Island last week? Marvelous. Annie will help you get dressed and you may meet Mr. Daldry on the grounds.
MRS. DALDRY
All right. And perhaps I may hold your baby again before I leave.
DR. GIVINGS
Ah, I did not realize you had met the baby. I hope that was not distracting in the middle of our session.
MRS. DALDRY
No—I liked holding her. We have not been able—
ANNIE
Oh, there, there.
MRS. DALDRY
—to have children. I do not know what is wrong with me.
DR. GIVINGS
Oh, dear Mrs. Daldry. Take heart. You see, Annie, it is the pent- up emotion inside the womb that causes her hysterical symptoms, you can see it quite clearly. I will administer another round of therapy to the patient. Lie back down, Mrs. Daldry.
He plugs the vibrator in again.
MRS. DALDRY
No, please no, do not touch me there again, it is very painful—no, please no— (He places the vibrator to her private parts) Oh—
DR. GIVINGS
What are you feeling, Mrs. Daldry?
MRS. DALDRY
My feet are very hot—dancing on hot coals—and down—down there—cold and hot to the touch—my heart is racing—
She has a quiet paroxysm.
DR. GIVINGS
That’s all right, Mrs. Daldry, there there. You just lie there and stay quiet for a while. I am going to go wash my hands.
MRS. DALDRY
Can you please hand me my hat.
ANNIE
Of course. You don’t need to be ashamed. This instrument has quite the same effect on all of our patients. Sometimes they laugh and weep all at the same time. They often call for God.
MRS. DALDRY
Oh dear.
ANNIE
It is quite all right Mrs. Daldry.
Annie puts the sheet back on her.
MRS. DALDRY
I am suddenly drowsy.
ANNIE
Yes, most of our patients become drowsy after the treatment.
mrs. Daldry
Might I lie down again?
ANNIE
Please do.
MRS. DALDRY
You are a midwife?
ANNIE
Yes.
MRS. DALDRY
And you assist Dr. Givings with births and all manner of things?
ANNIE
Yes.
MRS. DALDRY
How did you come to be a midwife?
ANNIE
I was thirty-three and unmarried, and hadn’t the patience for teaching young children.
MRS. DALDRY
You have assisted women in their confinements?
ANNIE
Yes.
MRS. DALDRY
So you have seen every form of torture.
ANNIE
I have seen women in a great deal of pain, yes.
MRS. DALDRY
Hold my hand and I will fall asleep.
ANNIE
Of course.
MRS. GIVINGS
I must be a very inconsistent person! I like to be wet and then I like to be dry and then I like to be wet again!
MR. DALDRY
You are very healthy and robust. I could barely keep up with you.
MRS. GIVINGS
I love to walk—I never had enough exercise as a child so now I walk walk walk no one can keep up with me not even Dr. Givings—that is how he fell in love with me, he said he was determined to keep up with me—he only saw the back of my head before we married because I was always one step ahead. He said he had to marry me to see my face.
Didn’t you darling?
DR. GIVINGS
What’s that?
MRS. GIVINGS
Have to marry me in order to see my face?
DR. GIVINGS
I see you have met my wife.
MR. DALDRY
Indeed.
DR. GIVINGS
We had a very successful session. You should find Mrs. Daldry much relaxed.
MR. DALDRY
Excellent.
MRS. GIVINGS
I gave Mr. Daldry a tour of the grounds. We got wet.
DR. GIVINGS
I don’t want you catching cold. The baby mustn’t catch cold at this age.
MRS. GIVINGS
You know I’m healthy as an ox. If only more of my milk would come in. Oh, excuse me, Mr. Daldry that is not polite to mention in mixed company.
MR. DALDRY
Are you advertising for a nurse?
MRS. GIVINGS
Indeed we are.
MR. DALDRY
Our housekeeper recently lost her baby and I believe she still has plentiful milk. Perhaps she could help though we don’t want to lose her services, she is very upstanding and all the rest of it, very hard to find, a gem. Self-educated, you see, with the manners of a lady. I don’t know if she’d ever take it into her head to be a wet nurse, you know what they say about wet nurses—nine parts devil, one part cow—but that’s what you want, isn’t it? A nice young woman who never intended to be a wet nurse but who has milk, milk to spare.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, she sounds perfect, we desperately want someone very moral whose child is recently dead.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, no—what I meant
DR. GIVINGS
What she means to say is— to say is—
MRS. GIVINGS
It’s only that they say morality goes right through the milk. Mrs. Evans said just the other day, oh I wouldn’t use a darkie, the morality goes right through the milk. But in the South, I don’t know what they do in the South—
MR. DALDRY
Elizabeth our housekeeper is colored but she is very moral, very Christian. She goes to church every week with Mrs. Daldry who is a very devout woman.
MRS. GIVINGS
I see.
DR. GIVINGS
Has she recovered from the death of her child?
MR. DALDRY
As I said, she’s a very religious woman resigned to the will of God. And her milk is still plentiful.
MRS. GIVINGS
Darling, I don’t know about a—
DR. GIVINGS
My father was a well-known abolitionist, Mr. Daldry.
MR. DALDRY
I believe I’ve heard of him. William Givings.
DR. GIVINGS
Yes.
You’d rather have a Negro Protestant than an Irish Catholic, wouldn’t you?
DR. GIVINGS
Is she married?
MR. DALDRY
Yes.
MRS. GIVINGS
That's good
MR. DALDRY
To be sure—you don’t want an unmarried woman boarding at your house—turn the household upside down—the pretty ones anyway—
MR. DALDRY
That is to say—she’s married to a fine man with a steady job.
DR. GIVINGS
We would be happy to take on your housekeeper Elizabeth as a wet nurse. And we can pay handsomely but not so handsomely that she leaves your service. We really are in dire straits because my wife’s milk is not adequate, I’m afraid. Bottle-fed babies don’t do well in cholera season, they don’t do well at all. It’s no time to stand on prejudice, Catherine.
MRS. GIVINGS
My husband is a very unconventional man, a scientist. I’ve no idea what the neighbors will say.
DR. GIVINGS
Let them observe that your baby is growing nice and fat.
MRS. GIVINGS
How well rested you look!
MRS. DALDRY
I feel wonderful. Your husband is a good doctor.
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes he is.
MR. DALDRY
There are roses in your cheeks.
DR. GIVINGS
Is the light bothering you, Mrs. Daldry?
MRS. DALDRY
No, I hardly noticed it. I was horrified when the electric lamp was invented. I so prefer candlelight and I thought, from now on people’s faces will look like monsters in the evening, without the help of candlelight. No flicker, no glow. But none of you look like monsters at present, you all look very charming. You are wet, Mr. Daldry.
MR. DALDRY
It is raining, Mrs. Daldry. Shall we?
MR. DALDRY
Might we borrow an umbrella? I did not anticipate rain.
DR. GIVINGS
To be sure. I always keep an extra umbrella in case of emergencies.
MRS. DALDRY
Thank you, Dr. Givings. I will see you again soon I hope?
DR. GIVINGS
Tomorrow, I believe is best. We will need daily sessions.
MR. DALDRY
Excellent.
Oh—how much do I owe you, Doctor?
DR. GIVINGS
Not to worry. We’ll settle up weekly.
MR. DALDRY
Oh fine, fine.
Then we shall see you tomorrow. And we’ll bring Elizabeth with us!
DR. GIVINGS
Good day!
MRS. GIVINGS
I’m nervous about bringing a stranger into the house, very nervous indeed.
DR. GIVINGS
Lotty is losing weight, my dear.
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes, of course, it’s all my fault.
DR. GIVINGS
I’m not assigning blame, my darling.
MRS. GIVINGS
Whose fault is it then?
DR. GIVINGS
No one’s. The body is blameless. Milk is without intention.
MRS. GIVINGS
A good mother has a fat child. And everyone knows it.
DR. GIVINGS
Then it will be a relief to find her a good nurse.
MRS. GIVINGS
Indeed. I cannot wait to meet her.
DR. GIVINGS
Cheer up, my darling. We are healthy and happy, are we not?
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes.
Yes.
DR. GIVINGS
It is important to examine you to be sure your milk is healthy.
ELIZABETH
Yes, sir.
DR. GIVINGS
I also need to be sure you haven’t any venereal disease that could be passed through the milk to the child. If you could just lie back please . . .
ELIZABETH
Sir, I’d rather not.
DR. GIVINGS
I’m a man of science, Elizabeth. Believe me, I won’t be shocked.
ELIZABETH
Yes, sir.
Sir—you won’t touch there, will you?
DR. GIVINGS
I’m going to give you a medical exam, that’s all.
MRS. DALDRY
Hello!
MRS. GIVINGS
Hello!
MRS. DALDRY
I was walking the grounds, they’re lovely.
MRS. GIVINGS
Why, you look in the bloom of health.
MRS. DALDRY
I played the piano again!
MRS. GIVINGS
What did you play?
MRS. DALDRY
I like to make songs up.
MRS. GIVINGS
Would you play one for me, please oh please?
MRS. DALDRY
I am very shy.
MRS. GIVINGS
No one is shy around me, Mrs. Daldry, I have the most wonderful effect upon shy people, they hear me talk and they think, oh why be shy?
MRS. DALDRY
I don’t feel shy around you, Mrs. Givings.
MRS. GIVINGS
I knew it! You see I’m terrible at the piano, I just pick at it with one or two fingers, it’s hardly been used, you must play it. The poor thing is languishing without a human touch. It is like a piece of dead wood without being played.
MRS. DALDRY
How can I say no?
DR. GIVINGS
Thank you Elizabeth, you were very brave, and you are very healthy. You can get dressed now.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh but that’s beautiful! A bit sad, isn’t it? Do you think we make sad things into songs in order to hold on to the sadness or to banish it—I think it is to banish the sadness. So then if you write a happy song, is it not sadder than a sad song because by making it you have banished your own happiness into a song? What do you think?
MRS. DALDRY
I don't know.
MRS. GIVINGS
Does it have words?
MRS. DALDRY
No.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, but it must have words, Mrs. Daldry, oh it must. I will supply the words, play it again, and I will sing some words with it, how is that?
MRS. DALDRY
All right.
Mrs. Daldry plays and Mrs. Givings sings.
MRS. GIVINGS
You raise the blinds in the morning And I like to close them at night. Together we sleep near the birdhouse And forget the electrical light.
MRS. GIVINGS
Did you like it? Did it go with your song? Oh I hope you liked it. I hope the song liked the words because the words loved the song!
MRS. DALDRY
The song liked the words.
MRS. DALDRY
Well that was very nice.
DR. GIVINGS
Mrs. Givings.
MRS. GIVINGS
Hello darling.
DR. GIVINGS
I have examined Elizabeth and she is very fit and healthy and will be a wonderful nurse to Letitia.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, that’s marvelous! I’m so sorry about your own child, Elizabeth, that’s dreadful.
ELIZABETH
Thank you.
MRS. GIVINGS
What was your child’s name or did she have a name yet, oh that would be horrible, I don’t know what’s worse frankly, a name or no name yet, oh I need to stop talking, when death comes up I just ramble on and on, I’ll stop now.
ELIZABETH
His name was Henry Douglas.
MRS. GIVINGS
A boy.
ELIZABETH
Yes.
MRS. GIVINGS
Have you—buried him yet?
ELIZABETH
He’s buried at the churchyard, All Soul’s. He was baptized before he died and for that I’m grateful.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, yes. Baptism, at least, is a comfort—he is in Heaven now.
ELIZABETH
I don’t like to talk about Henry Douglas. Ma’am.
MRS. GIVINGS
No of course you wouldn’t. Forgive me.
MRS. DALDRY
Elizabeth has two other boys. Two lovely boys, very well behaved.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, what a relief. We hope to have extra children, just in case, that is to say, more children. I would love to have a great big brood, all climbing over the furniture, furniture is so dead, that is to say so lifeless, I mean so sad, without children.
MRS. DALDRY
I don’t have any children.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh! What a pity.
DR. GIVINGS
Elizabeth, would you like to meet the baby?
ELIZABETH
Yes, sir.
DR. GIVINGS
Catherine, please bring the baby in to Elizabeth. Mrs. Daldry, why don’t you come with me.
MRS. DALDRY
Yes, Doctor.
DR. GIVINGS
Did that upset you to talk about children?
MRS. DALDRY
A little.
DR. GIVINGS
Are you feeling nervous?
My heart is pounding and I feel quite weak.
DR. GIVINGS
Well you just lie down, just lie down, and I will administer treatment.
MRS. DALDRY
Where is Annie today?
DR. GIVINGS
She should be arriving momentarily.
MRS. DALDRY
I do not wish to undress in front of you.
DR. GIVINGS
Yes, of course. I will make some notes. Call out when you are ready for me.
MRS. GIVINGS
Well. Here she is!
ELIZABETH
Would you like me to feed her now, ma’am?
MRS. GIVINGS
I suppose. She must be hungry.
Elizabeth sits, undoes her shirt, and begins nursing. Elizabeth cries, with no sound.
Mrs. Givings watches. Mrs. Givings is on the verge of tears. Elizabeth notices.
ELIZABETH
Perhaps it would be better if I fed her in the nursery.
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes, I think so.
eliz
Excuse me.
MRS. GIVINGS
Of course. Just through there.
DR. GIVINGS
Excuse me darling— What is it?
MRS. GIVINGS
Well, Lotty took to Elizabeth right away. She latched right on to her breast and it made me feel very strange, to see her latched on
to another woman’s breast. For once it wasn’t the baby who was crying. But I feel very queer, I do.
DR. GIVINGS
Now you have to think of the baby and what’s best for the baby. She would starve without milk, so think about that and be practical.
MRS. GIVINGS
I don’t feel well.
MRS. DALDRY
I’m ready, Dr. Givings!
DR. GIVINGS
I have to attend to Mrs. Daldry. Why don’t you have a nice lie- down. Here, I’ll shut off the lamp.
MRS. GIVINGS
I don’t want to lie down. I want to feed my own child.
DR. GIVINGS
But you can’t, love. Your milk isn’t adequate. I love you.

DR. GIVINGS
Sorry for the delay.
MRS. DALDRY
Not at all.
DR. GIVINGS
Fine weather we’re having.
mr.s daldry
Mm.
DR. GIVINGS
Chilly but bright.
MRS. DALDRY
Indeed.
DR. GIVINGS
There we are.
This will only take but a few minutes, Mrs. Daldry.
MRS. DALDRY
Oh ...
DR. GIVINGS
There there. What are you feeling, Mrs. Daldry?
MRS. DALDRY
It’s not working, today it’s not working.
DR. GIVINGS
There?
MRS. DALDRY
I don’t know.
Nothing. I feel nothing.
DR. GIVINGS.
Oh, dear.
MRS. DALDRY
Did I make it stop?
DR. GIVINGS
It’s not your fault. Electrical failure.

DR. GIVINGS
Well, I’m glad you’re here, Annie, we’ve had a power failure.
mr.s daldry
My head.
ANNIE
Oh, dear Mrs. Daldry, are you ill?
DR. GIVINGS
I have been trying these last three minutes, it’s never taken longer than three minutes with this machine.
ANNIE
Should I try the manual treatment, Dr. Givings?
DR. GIVINGS
Yes, why don’t you, I will go look into this. Good day Mrs. Daldry, Annie.
MRS. DALDRY
What is the manual treatment?
ANNIE
You just lie back.
MRS. DALDRY
Oh! Everything is quite wet! I don’t know what’s happened, I’m sorry—I. How embarrassing.
ANNIE
That happens from time to time, Mrs. Daldry, I’ll change the sheets. Aristotle talked all about it.
MRS. DALDRY
Aristotle?
ANNIE
Yes.
Do you read Greek?
Yes.
MRS. DALDRY
My goodness.
ANNIE
I’m going to wash my hands.
MRS. DALDRY
Of course.
Meanwhile, in the other room, Elizabeth enters. The living room is now lit with several candles.
ELIZABETH
Do you need me this evening, Mrs. Givings?
MRS. GIVINGS
Perhaps after supper?
ELIZABETH
All right.
MRS. GIVINGS
Wait a moment.
Elizabeth, when the milk comes in, can you feel any love for the child?
ELIZABETH
I try not to think of love. I try not to think of Henry Douglas.
MRS. GIVINGS
Of course. Do you want more children, Elizabeth? That is a tactless question, you don’t need to answer, forgive me, sometimes I say whatever is in my head.
I want more children and my husband desperately wants more children but I am afraid of another birth, aren’t you? When I gave birth I remember so clearly, the moment her head was coming out of my body, I thought: why would any rational creature do this twice, knowing what I know now? And then she came out and clambered right on to my breast and tried to eat me, she was so hungry, so hungry it terrified me—her hunger. And I thought: is that the first emotion? Hunger? And not hunger for food but wanting to eat other people? Specifically one’s mother? And then I thought—isn’t it strange, isn’t it strange about Jesus? That is to say, about Jesus being a man? For it is women who are eaten— who turn their bodies into food—I gave up my blood—there was so much blood—and I gave up my body—but I couldn’t feed her, could not turn my body into food, and she was so hungry. I suppose that makes me an inferior kind of woman and a very inferior kind of Jesus.
ELIZABETH
Hmm.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, dear, they said you were very religious, that must have sounded—
ELIZABETH
I was very religious.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh—I’m sorry, I—
ELIZABETH
I thought of Jesus while I was giving birth, like you. But I wasn’t thinking about why was He a man. I was thinking, please save me Jesus. And He did. Now why He didn’t save my Henry I don’t know, so I stopped believing in Him.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh!
MRS. GIVINGS
Ah, the electricity is back.
MRS. DALDRY
Hello.
MRS. GIVINGS
Hello!
ELIZABETH
Hello.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, yes. Would you play us something on the piano, I am sure Elizabeth would love to hear you play.
ELIZABETH
I have to get back to my boys for supper.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh stay for just one song.
MRS. DALDRY
All right.
ANNIE
What a pretty song, Mrs. Daldry.
MRS. DALDRY
Thank you, Annie.
ELIZABETH
I must go.
MRS. DALDRY
And I.
ANNIE
I am walking in your direction.
MRS. GIVINGS
Good-bye then, everyone gets a good walk except for me. Come again tomorrow or I will be very dull.
What is it, Elizabeth?
ELIZABETH
Do you pay me now, or later?
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh goodness! I haven’t any money, I’ll have to ask my husband. Perhaps we can settle up weekly?
That’s fine. Good-bye.
MRS. GIVINGS
Good-bye.
DR. GIVINGS
The power is back on! One day whole cities will be electrified. Mr. Edison is the man to do it.
MRS. GIVINGS
Don’t talk to me about electricity. You know how it bores me. Everyone is gone.
And we are alone.
DR. GIVINGS
Indeed we are.
MRS. GIVINGS
I shall turn this off.
DR. GIVINGS
Shall we go upstairs?
MRS. GIVINGS
Or stay here . . .
DR. GIVINGS
In the living room?
MRS. GIVINGS
I suppose it is for living in.
DR. GIVINGS
I'll get it.
DR. GIVINGS
Mrs. Daldry?
MRS. DALDRY
I forgot my hat.
MRS. DALDRY
DR. GIVINGS
Oh!
DR. GIVINGS
You look flushed. Are you all right?
MRS. DALDRY
Perhaps the walk overexcited me. I am not used to walking that much in one day. Annie and I were walking rather quickly, and discussing—well—she knows Greek, can you imagine—I feel faint.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh!
dr. giviings
There, there Mrs. Daldry. Why don’t you come see me in the operating theater. The electricity is back on.
MRS. DALDRY
Perhaps I’m intruding on your domestic life.
DR. GIVINGS
Not at all.
MRS. GIVINGS
Not at all.
DR. GIVINGS
This way. Mrs. Givings, why don’t you go to the nursery.
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes, dear.
DR. GIVINGS
No need to undress all the way, as you’re not feeling well, just lie down gently. Are you still feeling faint?
MRS. DALDRY
A little.
MRS. DALDRY
DR. GIVINGS
Are you often subject to faintness?
MRS. DALDRY
No more than once a week, I daresay.
DR. GIVINGS
I see. We’ll set you to rights, no worries. Are you ready?
MRS. DALDRY
Oh. Oh. No.
DR. GIVINGS
Tell me what you’re feeling.
MRS. DALDRY
I don’t—want—a machine.
DR. GIVINGS
Any fluid, Mrs. Daldry?
MRS. DALDRY
No. Nothing.
DR. GIVINGS
I will try using a finger as well as the instrument to replicate Annie’s experiment. Vulvular massage has been discounted in many circles but occasionally with the proper diagnosis and method it is just the thing.
MRS. DALDRY
Oh, oh, oh!
DR. GIVINGS
There, there, Mrs. Daldry, let it all out.
MRS. DALDRY
Oh, Annie!
DR. GIVINGS
Excuse me?
MRS. DALDRY
Please leave me. I feel much relieved.
DR. GIVINGS
I will wash up and let you get sorted. Take your time.
DR. GIVINGS
Excuse me.
DR. GIVINGS
What is it? The baby?
MRS. GIVINGS
What is that sound? What were you doing?
DR. GIVINGS
Electrical therapy, my dear. Very successful session.
MRS. GIVINGS
I wish to see it.
DR. GIVINGS
You would not understand. Leave me my dry boring science and I will give you the rest of the world. You said yourself that my electricity bored you.
MRS. GIVINGS
I insist on seeing your machine now.
DR. GIVINGS
Are you going to force me to lock my laboratory?
MRS. GIVINGS
I am your wife.
DR. GIVINGS
And happily you are my blooming young wife without a hint of neurosis and in no need of my inventions or experiments.
MRS. GIVINGS
Experiment on me!
DR. GIVINGS
I can assure you that you would not like it.
MRS. GIVINGS
Experiment on me!
DR. GIVINGS
It would be unseemly for a man of science to do experiments on his wife. I’d lose my credibility. Now would you have the good grace to be quiet while Mrs. Daldry is in the next room—
MRS. DALDRY
Do not let me forget my hat again.
MRS. GIVINGS
It is right here.
MRS. DALDRY
Ah. Thank you Dr. Givings.
DR. GIVINGS
Not at all. Good-bye.
DR. GIVINGS
I’m going to the club. Mr. Edison’s man is electrocuting dogs this evening. He is out to prove the deadliness of the alternating current over and above direct current. I think it’s hogwash. In alternating current, the current flips back and forth, back and— you see how much this bores you.
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes it is very boring good-bye and don’t kiss me good-bye please.
DR. GIVINGS
Very well.
MRS. DALDRY
I’ve forgotten my gloves, I’m so sorry, what must you think of me.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, I’m so happy to see you! My husband has just gone to the club and I am bored out of my mind.
MRS. DALDRY
I think my gloves are in the other room.
MRS. GIVINGS
It is locked.
MRS. DALDRY
Oh, I can come back tomorrow for my gloves.
MRS. GIVINGS
No, please stay. I have developed the most insatiable curiosity about my husband’s operating theater. Perhaps you can tell me how it works.
MRS. DALDRY
Oh—no—I don’t know how it works—
MRS. GIVINGS
He plugs it in, he turns it on, and then?
MRS. DALDRY
He applies electrical current to my—to my body—to release the magnetic fluid. That is what he says. Because there is excess fluid in my womb, causing my hysterical symptoms.
MRS. GIVINGS
Fluid?
MRS. DALDRY
Yes.
Really, I must go now—
MRS. GIVINGS
You sounded like this: oh, oh, ah-ee!
You were listening?
It was loud.
MRS. DALDRY
Oh, dear. I will leave you now.
MRS. GIVINGS
Stay for tea.
Where does my husband place the electrical device?
MRS. DALDRY
Just here.
MRS. GIVINGS
Hm.
And does it give you a pleasurable or a painful sensation?
MRS. DALDRY
Pleasure, and pain all at once—electrical current runs through my entire body—I see light—patterns of light, under my eyelids— and a kind of white-hot coal on my feet—and I shudder violently, as though struck by a terrible lightning—and then a darkness descends, and I want to sleep.
MRS. GIVINGS
I never heard of anything so strange.
MRS. DALDRY
Let’s talk of other things. They electrocuted an elephant at Coney Island.
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes, I’ve heard.
MRS. DALDRY
It is getting dark.
MRS. GIVINGS
I will turn the lamp on.
MRS. DALDRY
Please, don’t.
Can you imagine a time when all will be electric, all will be plugged in, why it will not stop at lights, but the way we cook our eggs and the way we get our chickens to lay their eggs too. Mr. Edison invented a recording device which he says will change everything, it will record the last wishes of the dying. Can you imagine? A man may know the voice of his great-great-grandfather, may know his last wishes. And what will become of the human body? Electrical arms perhaps. Even the fireflies will become electric.
MRS. GIVINGS
Electrical fireflies.
MRS. DALDRY
Yes.
MRS. GIVINGS
Electrical pianos.
MRS. DALDRY
God forbid.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, to think of never carrying a candle! Not to walk through a hallway at night, holding a candle, afraid of tripping in the dark, starting a fire—it makes one more solemn, do you not think? Or to blow out a candle—how beautiful! With one’s own breath, to extinguish the light! Do you think our children’s children will be less solemn? A flick of the finger—and all is lit! A flick of the finger, and all is dark! On, off, on off! We could change our minds a dozen times a second! On, off, on off! We shall be like gods!
MRS. DALDRY
I’m afraid so.
MRS. GIVINGS
Have you a hat pin?
MRS. DALDRY
Yes.
MRS. GIVINGS
I will just retrieve your gloves.
MRS. GIVINGS
Is this it?
MRS. DALDRY
Yes.
MRS. GIVINGS
How extraordinary. It looks like a farming tool. Where do you put it?
MRS. DALDRY
Here.
MRS. GIVINGS
I see.
Where’s the switch?
MRS. DALDRY
I’ve no idea.
MRS. GIVINGS
What a sound!
MRS. DALDRY
I will hold it in place for you.
MRS. GIVINGS
Is it heavy?
MRS. DALDRY
Tolerably.
MRS. GIVINGS
Well I don’t see what all the fuss is about.
MRS. DALDRY
Sometimes I close my eyes.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh! Oh!
Well that was very awful—it was a very dreadful strange feeling, I see why he has been keeping it from me.
MRS. DALDRY
Yes.
MRS. GIVINGS
Would you like a go?
MRS. DALDRY
Oh, no only the doctor can administer the treatment.
MRS. GIVINGS
I don’t see why. It looks quite simple. In this day and age, all one has to know how to do is press a button or pull a switch. I’ll hold it for you.
All right. Wait—
Is that not your husband’s carriage?
MRS. GIVINGS
I can’t hear a thing.
MRS. DALDRY
I hear horse’s hooves.
MRS. GIVINGS
You’re imagining things. He won’t be home from the club until at least seven o’clock.
MRS. DALDRY
Are you sure?
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh yes, when he starts talking about electricity he cannot stop.
MRS. DALDRY
Well then.
MRS. GIVINGS
Are you ready?
LEO
And then she left, very abruptly, for Italy.
DR. GIVINGS
I see.
LEO
It was a terrible shock.
I had been studying in Florence for the year. They are exacting masters over there—the line must be just so—the proportion just so—there is no freedom—you sharpen your pencil with a knife, as Leonardo sharpened his pencil. It was heaven. Not to have freedom. No freedom in art, but in life, life!
The peaches there tasted like peaches, the rain like rain. I met the woman in question in Florence. A very beautiful woman. (I know. No one ever said: I fell in love with a woman in Italy—a very ugly woman.) But she was beautiful. Perhaps not classically, but never mind . . . We met at the Uffizi. She was looking at the sculptures with no embarrassment, no embarrassment at all. I painted her face all summer. When she kissed she kissed with her whole body, not like American women who kiss only with their lips.
DR. GIVINGS
Mm.
LEO
You are perhaps shocked, Doctor, that I kissed her before marriage. I am a devotee of nature and I wished to avoid the fate of my boyhood friend. On his wedding night he was repulsed by his wife’s body. He said, when she disrobed for the first time, he saw something monstrous. What, what? I asked. She had body hair, he said, down there! Like a beast! You see, he had seen the female form only in marble statues—no body hair! You are a scientist, that must amuse you.
DR. GIVINGS
What men do not observe because their intellect prevents them from seeing would fill many books.
LEO
Indeed.
DR. GIVINGS
What happened to your friend?
LEO
He is now a very famous art critic.
His marriage went unconsummated for three years and was then anulled. I did not wish such a fate for myself, and so, while lips were willing and free and soft, I kissed them. Oh yes, I kissed them.
She did not come from a good family and her English was not very good but I did not care. Her soul lept out of her eyes. When I painted her I felt I could paint souls. Her soul hovered, just here, and I could see it. So when I painted I painted two inches away from the eyes, not the eyes themselves—it was a revelation! —I digress.
Mrs. Givings enters the other room and arranges tea things.
She journeyed with me to England to meet my parents, to announce the engagement. And then, the following morning, she fled. Back to Italy! No word, no letter! No answer to my inquiries! Nothing! And my whole body revolted against me. Headaches, eyesight, weakness, nausea . . .
DR. GIVINGS
And this weakness has persisted, for, what—?
LEO
Nine months.
DR. GIVINGS
In your extremities?
LEO
Yes. But the weakness in my eyes is perhaps the worst, because of my inability to paint.
DR. GIVINGS
So you haven’t painted for nine months?
LEO
You can’t paint in the dark.
DR. GIVINGS
It is very rare, a case of hysteria in a man, but of course we do see it.
LEO
Is it treatable?
DR. GIVINGS
I believe it is. I’d like you to undress to your underthings and lie down on the table. Annie, my assistant, will be in shortly.
LEO
I did not know there would be a lady in attendance.
DR. GIVINGS
She is the soul of tact and reserve.
MRS. GIVINGS
Was she a good eater?
ELIZABETH
An angel.

MRS. GIVINGS
Thank you, Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH
I think that babies are angels when they drink only milk, that first year. They could fly right back to where they came from, to the milk in the clouds. When they get teeth it is the beginning of the end, they become animals and there’s no going back.
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes.
ELIZABETH
But this one’s still an angel, no teeth.
MRS. GIVINGS
Well.
That will be all now, Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH
I’ll just get my things.
MRS. GIVINGS
No smile?
You were smiling for Elizabeth.
You raise the blinds in the morning And I like to close them at night Together we sleep near the birdhouse And forget the electrical light.
DR. GIVINGS
This, Leo, is what I call the Chattanooga vibrator. My own invention. It slips into the anal cavity.
LEO
Indeed.
DR. GIVINGS
Just face that direction, and curl up a bit, hugging your knees into your chest.
Annie will just operate the foot pedal which controls the speed. It functions—much like a sewing machine.
LEO
Ah.
DR. GIVINGS
We are going to stimulate the prostate gland. Are you ready?
LEO
I think so.
LEO
Oh. Oh! Oh.
DR. GIVINGS
Excellent! I think we can stop now for the day. How are you feeling?
Would you like a cup of tea?
LEO
I would love a cup of tea.
MRS. GIVINGS
Hello, darling. How is work?
DR. GIVINGS
A new patient. An interesting case. Very rare.
MRS. GIVINGS
A man?
DR. GIVINGS
How did you know?
MRS. GIVINGS
I heard a man’s voice.
DR. GIVINGS
I did not know the door was quite so porous.
MRS. GIVINGS
But why would a man come to see you?
DR. GIVINGS
Hysteria is very rare in a man, but then again, he is an artist. Perhaps you should take the baby for a walk, so that you don’t chance running into him.
MRS. GIVINGS
I believe the baby is still hungry—I’ll just go and find Elizabeth.
DR. GIVINGS
Yes.
LEO
Thank you.
How odd.
Lovely.
DR. GIVINGS
I’ll see you tomorrow. I believe daily sessions will be best at this early stage.
Feel free to use the grounds.
LEO
Excellent. Thank you, Doctor.
DR. GIVINGS
Of course. See you tomorrow then.
LEO
Yes, yes, of course.
MRS. GIVINGS
Hello.
LEO
Hello.
MRS. GIVINGS
Mrs. Givings.
LEO
You are the doctor's wife?
MRS. GIVINGS
I am. He seldom has men here. What a rare treat to make your acquaintance!
LEO
Leonard Irving.
MRS. GIVINGS
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Irving.
LEO
And you.
MRS. GIVINGS
So old fashioned.
LEO
I’m afraid everyone goes around these days saying: I am a modern man, I am a modern woman, it’s the modern age, after all. But I detest modernity.
MRS. GIVINGS
Do you! How contrary. Are you a very contrary person?
Some might say so.
MRS. GIVINGS
The cut of your coat is very old fashioned.
LEO
It’s my father’s old coat. I can’t be bothered with the cut of a coat. I throw on whatever my father leaves for rags.
MRS. GIVINGS
Is the lamp too much for your eyes?
LEO
The light has troubled me greatly for the past nine months, but I feel better presently.
MRS. GIVINGS
Just in case.
LEO
When Edison’s light came out, they were all saying, my God!— light like the sunset of an Italian autumn . . . no smoke, no odor, a light without flame, without danger!* But to me, Mrs. Givings, a light without flame isn’t divine—a light without flame—is like—
MRS. GIVINGS
What?
LEO
I cannot say.
Why not?
LEO
I hardly know you. I would offend your feminine sensibilities.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, no need to be shy around me, I just blurt anything out.
LEO
Well, then light without flame is like having relations with a prostitute. No flame of love or desire, only the outer trappings of—the act. And without love—without the mental quickening—the eyes—the blood—without the heart—or intellect—bodies are meat. Meat and bone and levers and technicalities.
MRS. GIVINGS
Well perhaps you were right. Perhaps you ought not to have said.
LEO
Not that I’ve ever known any prostitutes—intimately—
MRS. GIVINGS
I wasn’t implying—
LEO
It’s only a metaphor—
MRS. GIVINGS
Of course.
LEO
I love this time of afternoon, when the world is becoming dark, and you can see outside your window—lights in the neighboring windows coming on. One yellow—one almost white—little squares of light, other people’s lives—sheltered against the night, so hopeful. Ridiculous, isn’t it, to have so much hope, to think a little square of light could blot out the darkness—and yet— another comes on—and see—
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes—one—then two—
LEO
Look—there—another window lit—golden—the rest of the house dark—an incomplete painting. I love incomplete paintings— why do painters always insist upon finishing paintings? It’s unaccountable—life is not like that!
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh!
LEO
And the ones Michelangelo never finished—do you know them?—ghosts of lines hovering in the background. Have you ever seen Virgin and Child with the Angels?
MRS. GIVINGS
I have never been to Italy.
LEO
Oh you must go, and upon arrival, you must go directly to see that painting—the incomplete lines of God—they cannot be filled in because they would be too beautiful, they would shock the senses, and so they are almost there—women or angels—exchanging confidences—coming into being. A woman who is two-thirds done is nearer to God! A young woman on the verge of knowing herself is the most attractive thing on this earth to a man for this very reason.
MRS. GIVINGS
Do you think so?
LEO
Oh, yes.
MRS. GIVINGS
Excuse me.
Mrs. Daldry!
MRS. DALDRY
Hello. Am I early? I think that I am early.
MRS. GIVINGS
I have just made the acquaintance of Mr. Irving.
MRS. DALDRY
Pleased to meet you. But you are in the dark.
LEO
I must go. A thousand paintings. That is to say—a thousand apologies, as it were, for my rudeness at leaving so suddenly, I now have a thousand paintings to make. A bolt from the blue! I must order a new canvas. Several. Immediately. Good-bye.
MRS. GIVINGS
What an interesting young man.
MRS. DALDRY
Yes
MRS. GIVINGS
A painter.
MRS. DALDRY
Indeed!
MRS. GIVINGS
Mrs. Daldry, I have been wanting to speak to you ever since our adventure with the hat pin. You told me that you saw light when my husband treats you, and then you got drowsy and wanted to sleep. Well, I had such different sensations I wonder if it can be the same instrument at all. I was not the least bit drowsy afterwards. In fact, I was overcome by the desire to walk, or run, or climb a tree! How could one device cause such opposite reactions. Perhaps it is because I am well and you are ill.
MRS. DALDRY
I do not know. I have been so worried that your husband might find out and get upset with us and suspend the treatment.
MRS. GIVINGS
I do not care. I am determined to use the device again and unlock the mystery as to why it makes you drowsy and makes me very excitable. Why, I feel like a scientist!
DR. GIVINGS
Ah, Mrs. Daldry, Mrs. Givings. We are ready for you in the next room.
MRS. DALDRY
Yes.
DR. GIVINGS
Right this way.
Looking well, looking well. Your appetite has improved, no?
MRS. DALDRY
I daresay it has. Wonderful!
LEO
I’m sorry, I forgot my scarf. I left in such a state.
MRS. GIVINGS
I am very glad you have returned, Mr. Irving. I am all by myself as Mrs. Daldry has gone in to get electrical therapy and I, the wife, am left to my own devices. As it were.
LEO
I’m not sure what you mean, Mrs. Givings.
MRS. GIVINGS
Have some more tea.
LEO
I don’t want to impose.
MRS. GIVINGS
You’ll have to wait for them to finish before you can retrieve your scarf. Sit.
Sugar?
LEO
No thank you. Sugar is for women and small fat boys. Lovely.
MRS. GIVINGS
It’s fine weather we’re having for November.
LEO
Yes. Though dark.
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes, it is dark.
LEO
Dark so early. Dark and the trees so tall and naked. I think November is the tallest month because when the trees have lost their leaves they look so much taller. Tall in a—lonely way.
LEO
Yes—November is a tall month—October is a round month— April is a—skinny month—
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh do stop talking of the seasons!
LEO
Excuse me?
mr.s givings
We talk, we talk, and we surround ourselves with plants, with teapots, with little statuettes to give ourselves a feeling of home, of permanency, as if with enough heavy objects, perhaps the world won’t shatter into a million pieces, perhaps the house will not fly away, but I experienced something the other day, Mr. Irving, something to shatter a statuette, to shatter an elephant. Here is my riddle: what is a thing that can put a man to death and also bring him back to life again. Will you answer?
LEO
That is easy.
MRS. GIVINGS
Is it?
LEO
Love.
MRS. GIVINGS
No. Electricity.
DR. GIVINGS
Very good, Mrs. Daldry.
ELIZABETH
She ate again and now she’s sleeping. I never had a girl. When she eats, she eats so quietly, so politely, not like my boys, who were ravenous.
MRS. GIVINGS
Why thank you Elizabeth.
LEO
You are the baby’s nurse?
ELIZABETH
Oh, excuse me, I did not see you—I would not have spoken of— Yes, I am the baby’s nurse.
LEO
I should like to paint you nursing the baby.
ELIZABETH
That would not be—
LEO
A Madonna for our times. A Madonna after the Civil War—
ELIZABETH
Sir.
LEO
Oh dear, have I displeased you?
MRS. GIVINGS
You’ll have to excuse us, Elizabeth, the men in my household are very unorthodox, artists and scientists don’t care at all about convention, do they?
LEO
Since your husband has been treating me, I feel full of the most wild creative energies. I could paint all night, and everyone seems full of beauty. You, Elizabeth, are beautiful and you ought to be in a painting.
ELIZABETH
I’ve never had a man in the room when I’ve nursed a baby. My husband of course has seen me nurse my own but that is different.
LEO
I would pay you handsomely. And during your regular work hours, just triple the salary, and pretend I am not there while you work.
ELIZABETH
Triple the salary?
LEO
Yes. I cannot imagine she pays you very much for your services.
MRS. GIVINGS
Mr. Irving, really—
LEO
I will pay you ten dollars an hour for your services.
ELIZABETH
I will sit for you. But do not tell my husband and please disguise my features. And so that nothing would seem improper, I would like Mrs. Givings to sit in the room with us.
LEO
You must have a beautiful dress to wear, or a robe. Have you a dressing gown we could borrow?
MRS. GIVINGS
I—
LEO
It must be something that will allow the breast out, so that she may give suck.
DR. GIVINGS
Hello, Leo. I do not like that my patients should be scheduled so that they meet up—I’m so sorry—
LEO
I left my scarf.
DR. GIVINGS
Ah, go right ahead and get it, we are finished.
MRS. DALDRY
Hello.
LEO
Hello.
DR. GIVINGS
Hello, Mr. Daldry.
MR. DALDRY
Doctor.
LEO
I will just fetch my scarf.
MR. DALDRY
You are looking well, Mrs. Daldry. You looked well this morning but you have even more color in your cheeks now.
DR. GIVINGS
Isn’t the improvement amazing?
MR. DALDRY
Indeed! I think she might be ready to stop treatments.
MRS. DALDRY
I think that would be premature. I am not cured yet.
MR. DALDRY
But much improved. Yes.
MR. DALDRY
You are a magician, Doctor.
LEO
I’d forgotten my scarf.
DR. GIVINGS
Leo Irving.
MR. DALDRY
Dick Daldry.
LEO
Pleased to meet you.
MR. DALDRY
I am glad you found your scarf. It’s snowing.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh! Is it?
MRS. DALDRY
In November?
MR. DALDRY
Indeed. I brought your mackintosh, my dear.
MRS. DALDRY
Thank you.
MR. DALDRY
Thank you, Doctor.

DR. GIVINGS
Not at all.
LEO
I will follow you out, we can all walk together.
DR. GIVINGS
Good-bye.
MRS. DALDRY
Good-bye.
MR. DALDRY
Good-bye.
ELIZABETH
Good-bye.
LEO
Good-bye.
MRS. GIVINGS
Good-bye!
DR. GIVINGS
What is it?
MRS. GIVINGS
I think we ought to let Elizabeth go.
DR. GIVINGS
Whatever for?
Letitia is blooming and rosy and positively fat.
MRS. GIVINGS
I think Elizabeth is becoming attached to the baby.
DR. GIVINGS
You want her to give love to the baby but not too much love.
MRS. GIVINGS
Precisely.
DR. GIVINGS
I shall never understand women.
MRS. GIVINGS
I am still leaking bits of gray milk. It is as though my body is crying.
DR. GIVINGS
Oh, darling. You’ll be back to normal in no time. And it’s good for you to give up nursing, we can have another child more quickly.
MRS. GIVINGS
Another child! I can hardly—! She won’t even look at me!
DR. GIVINGS
Who?
MRS. GIVINGS
The baby!
She won’t smile at me!
I am not a good mother. I do nothing! I pour the tea! I wish you to use your machine on me.
DR. GIVINGS
Darling, it’s for women who are ill. It would probably have no effect on you at all, as you’re perfectly healthy.
MRS. GIVINGS
I am not healthy. I feel restless, and excitable, and I cry at the smallest thing. You help countless other women but me, your wife, you pat on the head.
DR. GIVINGS
What is the matter?
MRS. GIVINGS
She knows where to get comfort and love, and it is not from me.
DR. GIVINGS
You are her mother!
MRS. GIVINGS
In name only.Milk is comfort, milk is love. How will she learn to love me?
DR. GIVINGS
You do seem to be suffering, perhaps from the excess fluid of milk. I can perhaps try the treatment on you although it makes me nervous. But don’t go round telling your friends. It must not get out in the scientific community that I am treating my own wife.
MRS. GIVINGS
Now?
DR. GIVINGS
I haven’t any other patients for an hour.
MRS. GIVINGS
Now that you’ve given way I feel quite frightened.
DR. GIVINGS
There’s nothing to be frightened of, darling, come along, I’ll show you.
First you undress to your underthings. I shall turn around.
MRS. GIVINGS
Do all the women undress to their underthings?
DR. GIVINGS
It’s medicine, my love.
MRS. GIVINGS
I can’t do this bit without your help.
DR. GIVINGS
Oh—sorry.
Is that all right?
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes.
DR. GIVINGS
Don’t be alarmed.
Just lie down and relax.
DR. GIVINGS
Are you quite comfortable?
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes.
DR. GIVINGS
Electricity is not to be feared—it is harnessed from nature. I remember, when I was a child, I was stroking the cat’s back one day and was startled to see sparks rising up out of her fur. My father said, this is nothing but electricity, the same thing you see on the trees in a storm. My mother seemed alarmed. Stop stroking the cat. You might start a fire. I kept on stroking the cat. I thought: is nature a cat? If so, who strokes its back? God?*
MRS. GIVINGS
And what did you determine?
DR. GIVINGS
Natural law.
Is that too much pressure?
MRS. GIVINGS
No.
Oh,
Oh,
Oh—
Kiss me, darling, kiss me.
DR. GIVINGS
Afterwards.
MRS. GIVINGS
No, kiss me now.
Kiss me and hold the instrument there, just there, at the same time.
DR. GIVINGS
Darling, no—that would be—
MRS. GIVINGS
I don’t care, do it, do it, I have been longing to kiss someone. Like this.
DR. GIVINGS
This is what I feared. In a sick woman the device restores balance, but in a healthy woman it makes you excitable and perhaps even causes some perverse kind of onanism.
MRS. GIVINGS
What is onanism?
DR. GIVINGS
I am relieved that you do not know. I’m afraid the experiment was not a success dear.
MRS. GIVINGS
And I say it was a success! Kiss me, kiss me now!
This is inadequate! You are inadequate! Oh, God!
DR. GIVINGS
I made a terrible mistake bringing you into the operating theater. Men of science should never mix their family lives and their medical lives. It was my mistake, my darling, and we will both forget about it.
DR. GIVINGS
Now I want you to go upstairs and take a nap.
MRS. GIVINGS
No!
DR. GIVINGS
Catherine.
MRS. GIVINGS
I shall take a walk. Will you help me on with this
DR. GIVINGS
There are quite a lot of buttons.
MRS. GIVINGS
I could walk walk walk all night in the snow.
DR. GIVINGS
Is it snowing out?
MRS. GIVINGS
You didn’t notice the first snow? My God. When I first met you and was nothing more than a girl I wrote my name in the snow outside your window—I would have done anything for you to notice me—you were older, and seemed so wise, so calm—and so marvelously indifferent to me. I don’t know if you ever saw—it melted—no matter, if you saw my name in the snow all you’d see was a natural substance—
DR. GIVINGS
Catherine.
MRS. GIVINGS
I’m afraid you’ve done up the buttons wrong.
DR. GIVINGS
Sorry.
MRS. GIVINGS
It was an unnecessary gesture, childish, a name in the snow, but a gift must be unnecessary—for it to be good—but you want it to be useful, you wouldn’t say—well, it’s useless—but you made it for me alone. And so it will never melt. It will exist for all time. Uuugh—how ridiculous I sound. My hat please.
DR. GIVINGS
I made a very bad mistake today and I am sorry.
MRS. GIVINGS
Good-bye!
DR. GIVINGS
Take your wrap! It’s cold!
Did you really write your name in the snow?
DR. GIVINGS
Annie!
Can you take this down? I have suddenly thought up a new invention.
A vibrator made of water! The healing power of water, married to a great electrical force—could be—my goodness, revolutionary. The patient would experience a calming effect from the water, even as she has a release from the pressure, revitalizing the circulation. It could be used on patients who are prone to excitability—like my wife—that is to say—we will need twenty feet of copper piping right away, can you order it from the hardware store as soon as possible?
ANNIE
Yes, sir.
MRS. GIVINGS
How glad I am that I found you!
LEO
And I you.
You might have caught a terrible fever making snow angels without your coat—you looked like a fallen angel.
MRS. GIVINGS
Did I? Oh, I am cold, but the cold feels marvelous, I feel awake, my skin is tingling.
LEO
I must paint you like this.
MRS. GIVINGS
Leo—Mr. Irving—I must ask you—I know it is not proper—but I do not care today, I do not care at all—when you receive the treatment from my husband, where does he put it? The instrument?
LEO
I do not think your husband would like me to say, he would only speak of it in Latin or in Greek.
MRS. GIVINGS
Well, I only know English. Can you show me on my person?
LEO
Er—no. I may be an artist but I am also a gentleman.
MRS. GIVINGS
There is no such thing. Which is it, Mr. Irving? Do you dare to be an artist, or a gentleman?
She moves toward him. He moves away.
LEO
Look at the snow, out the window. Do you not think, Mrs. Givings, that snow is always kind? Because it has to fall slowly, to meet the ground slowly, or the eyelash slowly— And things that meet each other slowly are kind.
MRS. GIVINGS
You are changing the subject.
LEO
Indeed I am.
MRS. GIVINGS
Meet me slowly, like snow.
I cannot bear it.
DR. GIVINGS
Wait—Annie—we’ll also need ten copper valves—
DR. GIVINGS
Mrs. Givings takes her hand from Leo’s cheek.
LEO
I discovered your wife in the snow with no coat and insisted upon walking her home to warm her up before she caught a fever.
DR. GIVINGS
Then you did me a very great service, Mr. Irving.
LEO
Good-bye, Dr. Givings, Mrs. Givings.
DR. GIVINGS
Good-bye.
Was your hand on his cheek?
MRS. GIVINGS
It was.
DR. GIVINGS
I see.
MRS. GIVINGS
And do you mind very much?
DR. GIVINGS
It is odd—for some husbands such things end in a screaming match or even in death, one hand on a cheek. It has come to mean an absolute thing: the end of a book, those dreadful Mrs. Bovary books—but how can it be absolute when there are so many shades and degrees of love? Lady novelists like for it to be a tragedy— because it means that the affair mattered, mattered terribly—but it doesn’t, it needn’t.
MRS. GIVINGS
The writer of Madame Bovary was not a woman.
DR. GIVINGS
He was French, which is much the same thing.
MRS. GIVINGS
You dare to make a joke about the French—at this moment? Most men would be—pale with rage!
DR. GIVINGS
Pale with rage, exactly, in a sentimental novel. My point is: this is not the end of the book. You made a mistake, that is all. The treatment I gave you made you excitable. It is my fault. A hand on the cheek, these are muscles, skin, facts. It needn’t mean that one is preferred absolutely, or that one isn’t loved. So why then jealousy? My darling, I don’t mind.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh.
I had hoped that you would mind.
DR. GIVINGS
Catherine?
MRS. GIVINGS
Don’t talk to me tonight, don’t talk to me tomorrow! I will take breakfast in my own room!
LEO
It will be a revolution! I will call it: Nursing Madonna! How can there be so few Madonnas in which the baby Jesus actually gives suck.
MRS. GIVINGS
We are to think of Him feeding us, I suppose. Not the other way round.
LEO
Elizabeth, could you just—
MRS. GIVINGS
Hmm.
LEO
Don’t look at it, it’s not done yet—
MRS. GIVINGS
Sorry.
LEO
Elizabeth, could you just—
There. Beautiful. There is nothing so peaceful as nursing a baby. The baby and the mother become one being, do they not?
LEO
You seem nervous, Mrs. Givings.
MRS. GIVINGS
We should stop. My husband will be home from the club shortly and he wouldn’t approve of this, not at all.
LEO
I don’t see why. Your husband is a man who understands science, why then he must understand nature.
MRS. GIVINGS
I am not supposed to talk to his patients, much less arrange for them to see the bare breasts of the—help— in my living room.
LEO
Leave behind the stranglehold of convention and loosen your corset, Mrs. Givings, you will breathe much better.
ELIZABETH
She is done eating. She has fallen asleep.
MRS. GIVINGS
I can hold the baby.
LEO
I need her there for the angle of Elizabeth’s hands.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh.
What day of the week is it, anyway?
ELIZABETH
Wednesday.
MRS. GIVINGS
That’s right, Wednesday. It is always Wednesday, isn’t it? Or it was Wednesday only yesterday. It is almost never Friday. It is never, ever Tuesday, but always Wednesday, I find. Smack in the middle of the week. With nothing to look forward to but the charwoman coming and cleaning out the ashes.
Are you almost done with her hands?
LEO
Hands are difficult. You would think they would be just five quick lines, but no, they have personalities as intimate as faces. Elizabeth’s hands, for instance—they are fine hands, with long fingers that remind me of tapered candles. A person one has loved—the memory of their hands. Did they flutter or sit still? Dry? Moist? Cool on a hot forehead? What? That is what I wish to express in my paintings. The memory—of the movement—of very particular hands, even though they appear to be unmoving on canvas.
MRS. GIVINGS
Have you loved many women, Mr. Irving? Do you remember many—hands?
LEO
I have loved enough women to know how to paint.
If I had loved fewer, I would be an illustrator; if I had loved more, I would be a poet.
MRS. GIVINGS
Are poets required to love many women?
LEO
Oh, yes. Love animates every line.
MRS. GIVINGS
But what of the rest of us mere mortals. How many times must we fall in love in order to live through the week.
LEO
There is also the love of God, love of country, love of children.
MRS. GIVINGS
Indeed.
LEO
I must look at her hands.
DR. GIVINGS
You are early for your appointment, Mr. Irving.
LEO
Yes.
DR. GIVINGS
I will wash up and see you in the operating theater.
Good afternoon, Elizabeth. Catherine.
ELIZABETH
Oh, God.
MRS. GIVINGS
It’s all right. As you see, he is a man of science. Nothing upsets or shocks him.
LEO
You talk as if that’s a crime. What a capital husband you have. Completely beyond the dictates of modern society. I love your husband.
ELIZABETH
Shall I take the baby into the nusery?
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes, that will be all, Elizabeth.
I will put the paint things away. Go to your appointment, Mr. Irving.
LEO
Thank you, Elizabeth. You were nothing short of divine. Did you mind terribly being looked at? Being seen?
ELIZABETH
Who minds being seen?
LEO
Who?
ELIZABETH
Only criminals, I suppose.
LEO
Indeed.
MRS. GIVINGS
Good day, Mr. Irving.
LEO
Mrs. Givings.
DR. GIVINGS
No need to undress all the way. We can be quick about it. Just lower your trousers.
DR. GIVINGS
It seems that you and my wife are becoming acquinated.
LEO
A bit.
DR. GIVINGS
I see. She’s a wonderful woman, is she not?
LEO
Yes.
DR. GIVINGS
I’m a lucky man.
And your health, it seems to be much improved?
LEO
Yes, I am painting again. In fact, I cannot stop painting.
DR. GIVINGS
How wonderful. I am so glad for you.
LEO
Oh.
DR. GIVINGS
I do think you’re cured now. We can stop the treatments.
LEO
Thank you, Doctor.
I believe you’ve saved my life.
I am suddenly drowsy.
DR. GIVINGS
Take a nap. Good day.
MRS. GIVINGS
MRS. GIVINGS
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Daldry!
MRS. DALDRY
Hello.
MRS. GIVINGS
I have not visited with you since it was raining, Mr. Daldry.
MR. DALDRY
And I have not seen you since you were wet. Have you been well?
You look well.
Very well.
MRS. GIVINGS
Thank you.
MR. DALDRY
It’s good you’re done with that odious nursing business. A woman like you should be—enjoying yourself—not shut up in a nursery all day.
MRS. DALDRY
Will you do me a favor, my dear, and take a walk around the grounds before my appointment?
I wish to speak to Mrs. Givings about my needlework before Dr. Givings arrives and I fear we’ll bore you.
MR. DALDRY
I don’t have much to say on the subject of needlepoint. I’ll see you shortly. Darling. Mrs. Givings.
MRS. GIVINGS
Take a left turn by the fountain—there is a winter garden—I planted it myself—
MR. DALDRY
I didn’t know anything grew in winter—
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, yes—juniper and periwinkle and—
MR. DALDRY
It’s all the same to me. But if you planted it, Mrs. Givings, I’m sure it’s lovely.
MRS. DALDRY
I wanted to speak with you.
MRS. GIVINGS
Come and sit. You have taken up needlework?
MRS. DALDRY
No. I hate needlework. I have been thinking about what you said— about having two experiences of the same event.
I want very much to—I do not know how to—
but I was thinking—if we go into the operating
theater again, and if we place the instrument just so—
and if you held it, and then I held it—but we did a kind of—
ELIZABETH
I laid her down to sleep in her pram. I am sorry about the—
MRS. GIVINGS
Never mind, Elizabeth.
You may go now.
Wait, Elizabeth, before you leave—
perhaps you can settle a question.
Mrs. Daldry and I have had two experiences of the very same event. Have you ever had this sensation?
Either: you have shivers all over your body, and you feel like running, and your feet get very hot, as though you are dancing on devil’s coals—
MRS. DALDRY
Or you see unaccountable patterns of light, of electricity, under your eyelids—and your heart races—and your legs feel very weak, as though you cannot walk—
MRS. GIVINGS
Or your face gets suddenly hot, like a strange sudden sunburn—
MRS. DALDRY
Or there are red splotches up one side of your entire body—a strange rash—here—
MRS. GIVINGS
And the feeling of burning, as though you’ll get no relief—and your mouth is dry and you have to lick your lips—and you find your face making a very ugly expression, so you cover your face with your hands—

MRS. DALDRY
And sometimes a great outpouring of liquid, and the sheets are wet, but it is not an unpleasant sensation, only a little frightening?
el
ELIZABETH
Is that a riddle?
MRS. GIVINGS
Has that ever happened to you?
ELIZABETH
I do not know—the sensations are so contradictory. Does anything unite them?
MRS. GIVINGS
Many of them are—down below.
ELIZABETH
Oh—I see.
Well, the things you describe, some of them seem to be sensations that an invalid would have, or someone with a horrible fever— but others—sound like sensations that women might have when they are having relations with their husbands.
ELIZABETH
I’m sorry. Perhaps you were joking. Perhaps—I shouldn’t have said—
MRS. GIVINGS
With their husbands?
MRS. DALDRY
How interesting.
ELIZABETH
Those sensations you are describing—they are not from having relations with your husbands?
MRS. DALDRY
Good heavens, no!
MRS. GIVINGS
No! Good God.
MRS. DALDRY
I don’t know what I should do if I felt those things in the presence of my husband—I’d be so embarrassed I would leave the room immediately. As it is—my husband is very considerate—when he comes to my room at night, I am asleep—he tells me to keep my eyes shut, and I do—so I feel only the darkness—and then the pain—I lie very still—I do not see his face—my husband is—has always been—very considerate.
MRS. GIVINGS
Of course.
MRS. DALDRY
But the instrument produces a very different kind of pain, does it not? Very different from the other kind of pain? With my husband—
LEO
Ladies.
ELIZABETH
Good-by then.
LEO
I will see you home.
I have a good enough likeness, I can finish the painting at my studio.
ELIZABETH
I can walk home myself.
LEO
No, I wouldn’t hear of it, I will walk you home.
ELIZABETH
No thank you, Mr. Irving.
LEO
Please. You did me a great service today, I can at least see that you get home.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, don’t go just yet! leo
LEO
I’ll just see Elizabeth home. Oh, the painting!
MRS. GIVINGS
I’ll get it.
I will see you soon?
LEO
I'm afraid my treatments are at an end. I'm cured.
mrs. giving
But that’s impossible!
LEO
I will see you again. Never fear. Good-bye, Catherine. Dr. Givings. Farewell.
DR. GIVINGS
Mrs. Daldry. I did not hear you arrive. I’ll just let you get ready.
DR. GIVINGS
What can you be thinking of? Do you mean to embarrass me?
MRS. GIVINGS
I thought it was only a scene in a book to you. Or a fact.
DR. GIVINGS
Do you think it’s escaped my notice that you haven’t breakfasted with me for five days running?
MRS. GIVINGS
Breakfast is not a very romantic meal. I decided to skip it.
DR. GIVINGS
Is every meal supposed to be romantic?
MRS. GIVINGS
I do not enjoy you silently reading your scientific journals while I eat my toast.
DR. GIVINGS
You prefer grand passions over toast? My God, woman, we are married, a man needs to be quiet at least once a day.
MRS. GIVINGS
So I’ll be quiet then! HERE I AM! QUIET! QUIET AS A MOUSE!
MR. DALDRY
What a beautiful winter garden—sorry, am I interrupting?
MRS. GIVINGS
No. We were just discussing breakfast. You know, in Italy they hardly eat breakfast. Just a little bit of sweet cracker to dip in very strong coffee. They eat something light to recover from the great passions they spent during the night. Better to skip breakfast and move on to lunch, a great big lunch, when the silence isn’t quite so loud, no the silence is not quite so deafening at lunch.
DR. GIVINGS
How do you know about biscotti?
MRS. GIVINGS
Mr. Irving told me.
DR. GIVINGS
I see.
MR. DALDRY
I know nothing about biscotti. I like ham and eggs for breakfast, sausage too. A big breakfast is important for one’s energy, Mrs. Givings. I have once heard it said that small women should eat large animals. You ought to eat a bit of meat for breakfast, some bacon, or some sausage.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, I have plenty of energy, Mr. Daldry. I don’t need to borrow energy from a cow. I have so much energy I do not know what to do with it, you see.
MR. DALDRY
Mmmm.
ANNIE
We’re ready for you, Doctor.
DR. GIVINGS
Will you excuse me
MR. DALDRY
Oh, yes, certainly.
MRS. DALDRY
Dr. Givings?
DR. GIVINGS
Yes?
MRS. DALDRY
Is something wrong?
DR. GIVINGS
Oh—terribly sorry. I am distracted.
MR. DALDRY
Mrs. Givings. I—don’t always know how to converse—in a drawing room. I—
MRS. GIVINGS
Mr. Daldry!
What can you be thinking of?
MR. DALDRY
You said about your energies. I thought—
MRS. GIVINGS
You insult me.
MR. DALDRY
You have no idea how I long for a woman of energy. My wife is so tired, she is so tired, all the time.
MRS. GIVINGS
How dare you speak ill of your wife in my presence. Go. Please.
MR. DALDRY
Will you have the goodness to tell Mrs. Daldry to meet me at home, I will send a carriage for her.
DR. GIVINGS
It has been taking longer with you of late. Perhaps I need to build a new instrument with a few more beats per minute—perhaps the body gets accustomed to so many beats per minute and then requires more—
DR. GIVINGS
Hmm. Nothing. Is it past three minutes?
MRS. DALDRY
Perhaps if Annie tries.
Yes, of course, Annie why don’t you have a go. I will attend to some business.
DR. GIVINGS
My God. You are acting the part of a madwoman in a play! Listening at doors?
MRS. GIVINGS
You will offer to her what you deny to me!
DR. GIVINGS
It is medicine, my love!
DR. GIVINGS
And I say it isn't!
MRS. GIVINGS
I thought I heard a slap!
MRS. GIVINGS
It was nothing, nothing at all.
MRS. GIVINGS
Well, your work is done now.
You can go to the club.
And argue about the benefits of the alternating current over and above the direct current.
DR. GIVINGS
And you?
Do you favor the alternating or direct?
MRS. GIVINGS
Direct. From here to here.
DR. GIVINGS
Interesting. I would have guessed alternating. More complicated, changing direction dozens of times per second. Faces slapped by nobody. Italian breakfasts. Etcetera. I’ll be at the club.
MRS. DALDRY
Annie, have you ever used the instrument upon yourself?
ANNIE
Oh, no. For I’ve never been ill. I’ve scarcely had a day’s illness in my life. Maybe a bit of a stomach bug, but nothing mental. I’m sound as a horse, I was raised on a farm.
MRS. DALDRY
I could hold the instrument on you, if you would like, it is not unpleasant, and perhaps it would be interesting for you to experience it.
ANNIE
I do not think the doctor would like it.
MRS. GIVINGS
My husband . . . has gone to the club. And Mr. Daldry has also left. He sent a carriage for you. They both said their farewells.
MRS. DALDRY
Thank you, Mrs. Givings.
MRS. GIVINGS
Shall I leave you? I could—
MRS. DALDRY
I——
ANNIE
I——
MRS. DALDRY
I must get dressed.
MRS. GIVINGS
Of course. Annie, do you need any assistance cleaning up?
ANNIE
No, thank you, Mrs. Givings. It’s very easy to clean up.
MRS. GIVINGS
All right then.
I will leave you.
MRS. DALDRY
Well.
ANNIE
Well, then.
MRS. DALDRY
I suppose we could—continue with my Greek lesson.
ANNIE
Oh, yes. I believe we left off with the early Greek philosophers. Thales thought the earth was suspended on water, floated there, and he thought that all magnets had souls because they moved towards one another.
MRS. DALDRY
I can well believe that magnets have souls. When I look into dark eyes, like magnets, I am moved, unaccountably. You have very dark eyes, like magnets—has any man ever told you so?
ANNIE
No man has told me much aside from: pass the clamp.
MRS. DALDRY
They should Annie, they really should. Whatever happened to Thales?
ANNIE
He never married. His mother told him he should marry and he said: it’s too early. And when she pressed him again, ten years later, he said: it’s too late.
MRS. DALDRY
And you? Why have you never married?
ANNIE
One day, I woke up, and it was too late.
MRS. DALDRY
I see.
Annie, I have been thinking. I wonder whether I could purchase one of these instruments for home use. The doctor is so busy, and I really feel I’m almost better. My color has returned, and I wake up in the morning and feel hopeful. I could use it only as required, when, for example, I have trouble sleeping, as I often do, and I can’t very well call on the doctor past midnight.
ANNIE
Well—it might be dangerous for home use, because of the potential for electrocution, but I will ask the doctor. You know he is very open to inventions.
MRS. DALDRY
I would be too embarrassed to ask.
ANNIE
I will ask for you.
MRS. DALDRY
Good-bye then, Annie
ANNIE
Good-bye.
MRS. DALDRY
Thank you, Annie.
ANNIE
For what?
MRS. DALDRY
For the Greek lesson.
MRS. DALDRY
Are you quite all right, Mrs. Givings? Your color looks off.
MRS. GIVINGS
I am not myself.
MRS. DALDRY
Is there anything I can do?
MRS. GIVINGS
No, thank you.
Mrs. Daldry, did you dream of love from a young age?
MRS. DALDRY
Yes.
MRS. GIVINGS
And what did you think it would be like?
MRS. DALDRY
I thought it would be—never wanting for anything. Being surrounded and lifted up. Like resting on water, for eternity.
MRS. GIVINGS
And is that what you have found in marriage?
MRS. DALDRY
There have been moments of rest. But as it turns out, the earth rests on air, not on water, and the air can feel very—insubstantial—at times. Even though it is holding you up, invisibly.
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes.
MRS. DALDRY
Do you mind if I play your piano?
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, please do.
Excuse me.
MRS. DALDRY
What?
ANNIE
Oh.
MRS. DALDRY
How strange.
ANNIE
Oh dear.
MRS. GIVINGS
I had better not see you ever again.
ANNIE
I suppose not.
MRS. DALDRY
Good-bye then Annie.
ANNIE
Good-bye.
MRS. GIVINGS
Annie?
ANNIE
What a sad song she played. I believe it made me tear up a little. Good-bye Mrs. Givings.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, don’t leave, Annie—Dr. Givings is at the club and I have very little company.
ANNIE
I’m afraid I must go.
MRS. GIVINGS
What is the matter?
ANNIE
That song made me sad. Good-bye.
MRS. GIVINGS
Elizabeth. I did not expect you. What is it?
ELIZABETH
Mrs. Givings, I came to tell you that today was my last day working for you. My husband doesn’t like me gone so much. He wants me home with my own children.
MRS. GIVINGS
But you can’t leave us, Elizabeth! What on earth will we do without you?
ELIZABETH
She is almost ready to have cow’s milk. Or a little bit of rice porridge.
MRS. GIVINGS
I suppose. I was not thinking only of the food.
MRS. GIVINGS
But why today? I don’t understand.
ELIZABETH
Mr. Irving insisted on walking me home. He was not— inappropriate—but he kept hold of my arm. He paid me a large sum of money—for the sitting. And he walked me up to my front door.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh, dear.
ELIZABETH
My husband was home. My husband saw him. And me. And the painting.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh! Was your husband very angry? About the painting?
ELIZABETH
The painting? No. He cried when he saw the painting. It’s your hands, he said. Mr. Irving must be a good painter, it’s hard to paint hands.
But he doesn’t want me working here, not anymore.
MRS. GIVINGS
Of course. Yes—I understand.
ELIZABETH
No—you don’t.
I’ll just say good-bye to Lotty. I have grown fond of her.
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes. Well.
She is in the nursery. She is fat and happy, all thanks to you. Elizabeth—how old was your Henry Douglas when he died?
ELIZABETH
Twelve weeks.
MRS. GIVINGS
What did he die of?
ELIZABETH
Cholera.
MRS. GIVINGS
I am sorry.
ELIZABETH
Thank you.
MRS. GIVINGS
I think I should die of sorrow, in your place.
ELIZABETH
Die of sorrow? A mother of two cannot die of sorrow.
MRS. GIVINGS
But how do you go on, after?
ELIZABETH
My mother told me to pray each day since I was a little girl, to pray that you borrow everything, everyone you love, from God. That way your heart doesn’t break when you have to give your son, or your mother, or your husband, back to God. I prayed, Jesus, let me be humble. I borrowed my child, I borrowed my husband, I borrowed my own life from you, God. But he felt like mine not like God’s he felt like mine more mine than anything.
God must have this huge horrible cabinet—all the babies who get returned—and all those babies inside, they’re all crying even with God Himself to rock them to sleep, still they want their mothers. So when I started to feel something for this baby, for your baby, I thought no, take her back God.
When I first met her all I could think was: she is alive and Henry is not. I had all this milk—I wished it would dry up. Just get through the year, I thought. Your milk will dry up and you will forget. The more healthy your baby got, the more dead my baby became. I thought of her like a tick. I thought—fill her up and then pop! You will see the blood of my Henry underneath. But she seemed so grateful for the milk. Sometimes I hated her for it. But she would look at me, she would give me this look—I do not know what to call it if it is not called love. I hope every day you keep her—you keep her close to you—and you remember the blood that her milk was made from. The blood of my son, my Henry. Good-bye, Mrs. Givings.
MRS. GIVINGS
Good-bye, Elizabeth.
MRS. GIVINGS
Thank you.
MRS. GIVINGS
You have made quite a mess of things for Elizabeth.
LEO
I know. I’m sorry. I’ve come to say good-bye. I’m moving to Paris.
MRS. GIVINGS
When?
LEO
Tomorrow.
MRS. GIVINGS
Take me with you.
LEO
Are you out of your mind?
MRS. GIVINGS
You are surprised? It was you who seduced me!
LEO
What?
MRS. GIVINGS
All that talk of women, two-thirds done, that was me, you were talking of me, were you not?
LEO
I was talking of paintings. I—
MRS. GIVINGS
No one has ever spoken to me of those things before. Of beauty—of prostitutes, of—my God, of Italy. How could I have misunderstood your intentions? I’m in love with you.
LEO
Oh, dear Catherine I am afraid I cannot love you. If there is any type to whom I am attracted—it veers toward women with doe eyes. And your eyes are more—they are more—thin—the light bounces off of them rather than into them. And I cannot see your soul hovering here, where I would like to. Your soul is locked somewhere inside your body, so I cannot see it. Another man could perhaps bring your soul outside your eyes but it’s not me, I’m afraid. I do care for you though.
MRS. GIVINGS
Try. Try to bring my soul out—to here. If you look into my eyes—see—I will try.
Are you bringing another woman with you?
LEO
No—I am going alone.
Don’t you see? It is Elizabeth who I love.
MRS. GIVINGS
Elizabeth?
LEO
Yes.
MRS. GIVINGS
Oh—I see nothing, I understand nothing—my God, Elizabeth.
LEO
Yes. And she doesn’t care for me, not at all. I told her of my affections on our walk and she slapped me. No—I will go to Paris alone. I am married to my solitude.
MRS. GIVINGS
I can be your solitude. I will be quiet as a mouse. I understand solitude, I am very lonely.
LEO
I do not understand your loneliness, Mrs. Givings. You have a child, a husband—a home!
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes. I am very ungrateful. I am sure that God will punish me.
LEO
No. You do not love me. You only think you do. You love your husband. He is a good man. Good-bye, now.
MRS. GIVINGS
Elizabeth is in the nursery. If you wish to say good-bye to her.
LEO
I can’t bear to see her. Just give her this, won’t you?
LEO
Come visit me in France. I promise you—you’ll love the paintings.
DR. GIVINGS
My dear, what on earth are you doing?
MRS. GIVINGS
I am alone.
DR. GIVINGS
Darling—
MRS. GIVINGS
You are not alone, I am here. Have you been using this instrument on yourself?
MRS. GIVINGS
I am so lonely—Elizabeth is leaving us—Leo is leaving us— everyone is leaving—you are gone—you are at the club, or in the next room, always in the next room, with the door locked. You see that women are capable of pressing a button themselves.
DR. GIVINGS
Darling—
When you touched them, the other women, and Leo, with the machine, did you feel love for them, when you touched them there, was it like love?
DR. GIVINGS
No. I only wanted them to feel better.
MRS. GIVINGS
And when you married me, did you want to love me, or did you want to make me feel better?
DR. GIVINGS
A doctor wants to make everyone feel better.
MRS. GIVINGS
But did you want to love me?
DR. GIVINGS
Yes! And you—with your hands on other men’s faces—do you love them? Do you love Mr. Irving?
MRS. GIVINGS
A little.
dr. givings.
I have a strange feeling in my stomach.
MRS. GIVINGS
What is it?
DR. GIVINGS
My eyes feel funny and my stomach feels jumpy. I believe I’m jealous.
MRS. GIVINGS
Give up your operating theater, darling.
DR. GIVINGS
And do what instead?
MRS. GIVINGS
Love me. Love me for your job.
DR. GIVINGS
All day long?
MRS. GIVINGS
All day long. I have heard that some women do not need the vibrating instrument to give them paroxysms, that relations with their husbands have much the same effect. Love me for your job.
DR. GIVINGS
I would like to love you.
MRS. GIVINGS
Would you?
DR. GIVINGS
Yes. I have not known how.
MRS. GIVINGS
You said to me when my hand was on another man’s cheek that there were all types and shades of love—But what is it then, this very particular way in which you love me? What color? What tempera- ture? And please do not say: you are my wife, I am your husband.
DR. GIVINGS
I do not have the words.
MRS. GIVINGS
Please try.
That is why they have poets—to classify all the degrees of love. It is for scientists to classify the maladies arising from the want of it.

MRS. GIVINGS
Try.
DR. GIVINGS
Do not make fun of me. Do you promise?
MRS. GIVINGS
I promise.
DR. GIVINGS
I bless thee: temporomandibular joint I bless thee: buccal artery and nerve
I bless thee: depressor anguli oris
I bless thee: zygomatic arch
I bless thee: temporalis fascia.
I bless thee, Catherine.
MRS. GIVINGS
Open me.
DR. GIVINGS
Here?
MRS. GIVINGS
Away from the machine. In the garden.
Undress me there.
DR. GIVINGS
You wish to undress in the garden in December?
MRS. GIVINGS
Yes, and please, do not call me impractical. Our whole future happiness depends upon it.
MRS. GIVINGS
Undress me.
Do not close your eyes, look at me . . .
DR. GIVINGS
The street lamps are coming on. Someone will see us.
MRS. GIVINGS
No one will
Are you cold?
DR. GIVINGS
No. Are you cold?
MRS. GIVINGS
No.
MRS. GIVINGS
How beautiful you are! Your body!
I have never before seen that little bit there, under the covers— or that bit there, or this beautiful line here—
I have felt this shadow there but I have never seen it—
how it curves—
DR. GIVINGS
I am embarrassed.
MRS. GIVINGS
Don’t be.
DR. GIVINGS
Catherine.
Oh, God. Oh, God, Oh, God.
