LIL
(Wiggles line.) If you were a person, you know what we'd call you? A C.T. You nuzzle the bait but you don't put out. Now, I'm going to try a different approach, it's called courting. You're going to love it. Here's how it goes. You're a terrific looking fish, you know that, sweetheart? You're a real knockout. Now, don't get me wrong, it's not just your body I'm after. I love your mind, your sense of humor, your intellect, your politics. . . . Aha, I'm getting your attention, huh? I respect you, darling. I love you. Now, bite, baby, bite
EVA
I'd fall for that. It's a good line.
LIL
(Surprised.) Would you mind telling that to the bluefish? (She notes that EVA is an attractive woman and turns on the charm.) I usually do pretty well with that line, I must be losing my touch.
EVA
(Not picking up on LIL's flirtatiousness.) Maybe you need to change your strategy. (She walks to water's edge and peers at fish.) You could try caveman tactics. Hit it on the head wi v h a stick.
LIL
Not my style. I prefer a classier approach.
EVA
Have you tried poetry? (To fish.) "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate."
LIL
(Peers into water.) It's gone. Gone. You've driven that fish right back to the Atlantic.
EVA
(Shrugs.) As my mother always tells me, there are other fish in the sea.
LIL
That's a practical philosophy. Coldhearted but practical.
EVA
You're getting a bad sunburn. Is that your shirt? Better put it on.
LIL
Thanks.
EVA
(Going.) Don't lose heart. Maybe you'll catch that fish tomorrow.
LIL
Hey— (EVA turns.) I'm Lillian Zalinski. Everybody calls me Lil.
EVA
Eva Margolis. I'm the pink cabin for the summer. (She continues to leave.)
LIL
(Trying to stop her.) Holly House. We call it Holly House. I'm in Crabapple, right up there. We've all been wondering who rented Holly House this season. The couple who had it the last two years split up. You're the only newcomer on the Cove this year, the other cabins are the same old gang. Are you alone?
EVA
Yes. The other cabins are all rented to couples?
LIL
(Meaningherself.) All but one.
EVA
I guess I'll have to get used to being odd man out.
LIL
More like New Girl In Town. You'll get lots of attention, I guarantee it.
EVA
(Still misunderstanding.) Well, I could use some attention. You're married, of course?
LI L
Not me. I'm the other one who's not a couple.
EVA
Are you one of those swinging singles I've read about?
LIL
(Teasing.) Well, that depends . . .
EVA
(Thinking she's got it.) I bet you're an artist—or a writer!
LIL
No. I used to sell time for a television station—but I'm taking the summer off.
EVA
You and I are the only singles?
LIL
That's right. (LIL, of course, is pleased at that.)
EVA
(Disappointed.) Well, it's going to be a long summer. I hope you play chess. (She starts to leave again.)
LIL
I hate it. I like to fish.
EVA
You can't fish at night.
LIL
I could fish at night but I prefer to do more interesting things. (EVA still looks blank.) Hey, would you toss me those sandals? This beach is murder on the feet. (EVA brings her the sandals.) You'll have to come to the opening of the season bash tonight. It's at my cabin, right up there. Music, food, booze, dancing. (EVA is trying to size LIL up.)
EVA
Were you ever married?
LIL
(Cavalierly.) Oh, sure. Lots of times.
EVA
I was only married once. For twelve years.
LIL
(Stunned.) Twelve years? I had one that made it two years and eight months. Eight long months. Rae and Annie will approve of you. They've been together nine.
EVA
How many times were you really married?
LIL
Oh God, I don't know—a dozen? Who counts?
EVA
Come on. A dozen husbands?
LIL
(Realizing.) Husbands?
EVA
Husbands. You know the guy in the tuxedo, he's waiting at the altar when you come down the aisle.
LIL
Husbands.
EVA
Husbands.
LI L
How did you come to rent Holly House?
EVA
Oh, it was a godsend. I walked out on George on Wednesday, just packed the suitcases and left. It gave me such pleasure to leave him stranded with a paisley overnight bag and a Board of Directors meeting in Chicago the next day. He'd go naked before he'd carry a paisley bag into a Board of Directors meeting —no, he wouldn't go naked. He thinks he's underdeveloped—for all I know, he may be. I married him when I was still in college so my basis for comparison is limited. Is six inches small? This book I'm reading says size doesn't matter. It's all in how he uses it. Foreplay is everything—this book says. It's called The Female Sexual Imperative. It's written by a woman doctor. Have you read it?
LIL
(Stillstunned.) I've seen it.
EVA
(Enjoying this conversation.) Well, you probably know everything that's in it, anyway. I can't believe I've gotten to be this old and I don't know anything.
LIL
How did you get Holly House?
EVA
I left George on Wednesday and drove until dark. I wasn't heading any place in particular, I was just leaving George. I wound up in the village over there and checked into the Holiday Inn. The desk clerk—he was one of those sweet young men, you know the kind—handed me the room key and I burst into tears. I realized that I was going to spend the night alone, away from home, for the first time in my life.
LI L
How did you get here?
EVA
To Bluefish Cove? Well, the desk clerk—actually, he was quite nice in spite of his predilections—he said there was a place right down the street where I could get a drink and not be approached by mashers, a place where mostly businesswomen went. . . .
LIL
He sent you to Molly Pitcher's?
EVA
And I met this nice lady at the bar—she's a real estate agent—
LIL
Margery Eaton.
EVA
She handles the rentals for Bluefish Cove. I suppose you know her.
EVA
I told her I needed quiet, some place to get myself together—she was wonderful. She didn't question me or ask for references, she didn't even ask me if I had a husband or kids. She just took my money and handed me the lease. I think she's a feminist. She assumed I was in charge of my own life.
LI L
She assumed something, that's for sure.
EVA
And it's working out wonderfully. It's beautiful here— and maybe I'll make some new friends. This party tonight, it's at your cabin?
LI L
(Quickly.) But you don't have to come.
EVA
Oh, but I want to. I've been holed up in my cabin for days now reading The Female Sexual Imperative. A party tonight would be just perfect, Lil. It's time for me to make my debut as a single woman.
LIL
(Trying to ease out gracefully.) Eva, you might feel out of place.
EVA
(Misunderstanding.) Because I'm single? Well, you are, too. Of course, I've been married so long I've forgotten how to flirt—but then you said it's mostly couples here—still, somebody might have a single houseguest or a bachelor brother, you never know, we might get lucky. I don't even remember how to hold a conversation with a man. (She sees that LIL is uncomfortable.) I promise not to cut in on your territory.
LIL
Somehow I'm not worried about that. It's just a bunch of beach bums, just the residents of the Cove. It's no big thing.
EVA
It is to me. I'm going to a party—by myself! I feel like a teenager again. When I was in high school, my best friend Joan and I always had a pow-wow before going to a party— I would never have dreamed of picking out a dress—or a boyfriend—without getting Joan's approval first. (Touching LIL's hand.) This book is right. It is possible for grown women to be friends. (She feels slightly awkward at the sudden closeness and turns to leave.) Thank you, Lil. I'll see you tonight!
LIL
(As EVA goes, LIL glances toward the cabin.) Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
KITTY
Damn Marge Eaton!
RITA
She might have been drunk.
RAE
I think she made a perfectly reasonable assumption.
ANNIE
Walks like a duck, talks like a duck, hangs out with ducks, must be a duck.
KITTY
How could Marge do this to me?
RAE
If you meet a woman in a gay bar, you naturally assume she's gay.
KITTY
This could ruin my career!
RAE
Annie has just as much to lose as you have, Kitty. Annie's famous, too.
ANNIE
Rae. ..
RAE
Well, you are, darling. Annie was famous when you (Meaning KITTYJ were still delivering babies at that clinic in Brooklyn.
KITTY
It's not the same thing. Annie's a sculptor.
RAE
Sculptress. We take pride in the feminine gender.
KITTY
Well, you shouldn't. It's diminutive. Sculptor is generic. And nobody cares who a sculptor. . .
RAE
Sculptress.
ANNIE
Honey. . .
KITTY
Who a sculptor goes to bed with.
RITA
Kitty is developing a new language. She's going to write a dictionary of nonsexist language.
KITTY
Nobody cares who you go to bed with.
RAE
I do.
KITTY
I have a new book coming out!
RITA
It's even better than The Female Sexual Imperative. It's called Coming Together
KITTY
I'm trying to liberate American women.
RITA
Publisher's Weekly gave her an award. "Literature's Most Credible Women's Libber."
ANNIE
Don't worry, Kitty. If your career blows up, we'll give you an award. (She hands KITTY a drink.) "Bluefish Cove's Most Incredible Dyke."
KITTY
It isn't funny. I'll lose my credibility.
ANNIE
Not to mention your royalties.
KITTY
I'm dependent on my royalties! (About RITA J We're dependent on my royalties. I gave up a career in medicine, remember, to devote myself to The Movement.
RAE
Why is it every time Kitty says "The Movement," it sounds like a disturbance of the lower colon?
KITTY
I don't know why I come back here every summer— I don't know why I put up with the bunch of you—I'm dedicating my life to a worthy cause—
RITA
We didn't have to come here this summer. The Swedish government offered Kitty a grant to go there and write.
ANNIE
Kitty, m'dear, we are your old friends. We recognize that you gave up long gory hours in the operating room in order to make a million writing books; we recall how you sacrificed day after day of peering up dark vaginas with a penlight in order to become a national celebrity. Our hearts bleed for you when we see your handsome face on the cover of Ms. or tune into Phil Donahue and listen to you instructing American women to grab their sexuality—
RAE
No, honey. "Seize their sexuality," that's what she said on Donahue. "Seize your sexuality," she said. Some woman in the audience thought she was advocating masturbation.
RITA
She does advocate masturbation. There's a whole chapter on it in this new book.
ANNIE
We are aware of your achievements and cognizant of your sacrifices. We have watched you fall in and out of love, in and out of lust, in and out of hangovers, we have tolerated and accepted you when you were young, dedicated and struggling, we tolerate and accept you now that you are rich, famous and arrogant. Bluefish Cove is more than just a lesbian beach colony, Kitty, it's family. And that's why you keep coming back.
RITA
Kitty is not arrogant. She's brilliant.
ANNIE
She's both. And she depends on us to keep her from becoming totally obnoxious.
KITTY
I wouldn't take that from anybody else, you know.
ANNIE
I know. That's why I said it.
RAE
What are families for?
KITTY
(Calling out to steps.) Lil, how can you do this to me? My career is in jeopardy! A straight woman in Bluefish Cove. I can't believe it. Is nothing sacred any more?
ANNIE
Kitty, don't get in a snit and screw up this summer, huh? Have some consideration, will you? (She nods toward the door where LIL sits outside.)
RAE
It's just one woman. One simple, little woman. She's not going to rent the Goodyear blimp and fly cross-country with a banner announcing that Dr. Kitty Cochrane is a lesbian.
KITTY
It only takes one person to start a rumor that can ruin a career.
ANNIE
Lil has the right to invite anybody she wants, anybody at all, to her own cabin for her own party.
KITTY
What difference does it make to Lil? She hasn't got anything to lose.
RAE
Kitty.
KITTY
I didn't mean it like that. I just mean—we're dealing with the rest of my life.
ANNIE
We're dealing with the rest of Lil's life, too.
RAE
We all agreed we were going to make this summer perfect. Nobody is going to fight—
ANNIE
or fuck around.
RITA
Kitty never fucks around.
RAE
Love is blind.
ANNIE
(To KITTY and RITAJ Please, think about Lil.
RITA
(Helpfully.) Well, maybe it won't be so bad, Kitty. She is a straight woman. She'll be source material for your new book.
KITTY
Well, I can't see any other way of doing this
ANNIE
I'm just about to give up on you, Kitty.
KITTY
I can say Rita's my cousin.
RITA
You could say I'm your secretary. I am your secretary.
KITTY
But, darling, she's bound to come into our cabin sometime during the summer and celebrities don't sleep in a double bed with their secretaries—but if you're my cousin —
RAE
Incest is preferable to being gay.
KITTY
(To RAEJ Annie could be your—sister-in-law. You can say you're divorced, which is true, you wouldn't have to lie, and you can say Annie's husband died valiantly in Viet Nam.
RAE
I don't want to be around when you suggest that to Sue. Sue's slightly paranoid about that age difference, anyway.
RITA
But Kitty, we'd have to lie all the time. I mean, if the woman is living in Holly House, she's going to see us everywhere, every day, on the beach, at the picnic tables, in the glen, on the path . . .
RAE
Kitty, the woman may be straight but I haven't heard that she's retarded.
RITA
I don't know if we could carry it off, Kitty. Someone's bound to make a slip.
KITTY
Oh, shut up, Rita. I know that. They wouldn't do it, anyway. Nobody cares about my career! The whole thing is hideous and impossible. (She wails and sinks into further depression.) Sooner or later, it's your friends who do you in. My father used to say that.
ANNIE
Need some help?
LIL
No thanks, I'm almost finished.
ANNIE
Why didn't you have them cleaned at the market?
LI L
How'd you know I didn't catch these?
ANNIE
I was looking out the window this afternoon when you came up the stairs with an empty bucket.
LIL
Don't rat on me. I have a reputation to uphold.
ANNIE
My lips are sealed.
LIL
Actually, I don't mind cleaning them. It releases my hostilities, f ANN IE hands LIL the drink.) Thanks. Has Kitty offended anyone yet?
ANNIE
Everyone. Right off.
LIL
Good. It's the opening of the season initiation. Kitty offends everyone, everyone puts Kitty in her place. Then we can settle in for the long, hot summer. Same thing, every year. When I lived with Kitty, it was a nightly ritual, putting Kitty in her place. She thrives on it, you know.
ANNIE
She's having a temper tantrum about your asking the straight lady to the party tonight.
LIL
I never would have if I'd known she was straight—but by the time I found out, it was too late. Well, she'll have to face it sooner or later—she might as well know right now, at the beginning of the season, she's smack in the middle of a bunch of dykes.
ANNIE
Kitty would prefer she never finds that out.
LIL
Kitty may change her mind when she sees her. She's nice looking.
ANNIE
I saw her. From the window.
LIL
Ah-ah.
ANNIE
Not me. I'm a married lady.
LIL
Maybe she'll turn out to be a nice, straight lady for Kitty to chase around after all summer. Kitty has never made it through a summer at Bluefish Cove without at least one side affair.
ANNIE
Not true. She never fooled around the two years she lived with you. You were the one who fooled around.
LIL
She called me an alley cat.
ANNIE
I remember. You had that fling with Donna. . . .
LIL
But I denied it. I swore, Girl-Scout's Honor, I hadn't laid a finger on Donna.
ANNIE
She didn't believe you. Kitty may be a pain in the ass but she's nobody's fool.
LIL
She set the answering machine to monitor and record. She bugged our goddam telephone.
ANNIE
And you, dummy, made a date to meet Donna at a motel —
LIL
Well, where else? She was living with Sue, I was living with Kitty—I'm too old to do it in the back of a car.
ANNIE
Didn't Kitty follow you to the motel?
LIL
Pounded on the door, made a complete ass of herself. Donna and I jumped out the window, bare-assed, with our clothes under our arms. Good thing we were on the first floor.
ANNIE
And Kitty never let you back in your apartment.
LIL
Never. Changed the locks and put my things out in the hallway like an Indian matriarch divorcing her husband.
ANNIE
You ever wish you'd stayed with Kitty?
LIL
It never would have worked.
ANNIE
It might have. I wouldn't have believed, nine years ago, that Rae and I would make it—but we have. And it's better now than it ever was.
LIL
(Shrugs.) I'm not a long-distance runner, Annie.
ANNIE
You were in love with Kitty.
LIL
Oh, for a minute, maybe. But I had a lust for freedom and she had a lust for fame and fortune. . . . Kitty's all right. Don't go so hard on her.
ANNIE
I'll try to remember that.
LIL
Someday sculptures by Anne Joseph will be in the Metropolitan and dedicated little art students will pry into your life, long-nosed intense professors will refer to you as the Master of Free Form. . . .
ANNIE
You think so?
LIL
I know it. And books by Dr. Kitty Cochrane will be on library shelves a hundred years from now. How long will your sculptures last?
ANNIE
(Uneasily.) Indefinitely.
LIL
Thousands of years. And Rae has two grown children and they'll have children. That's a kind of immortality. (Pause.) Alley cats just come and go.
ANNIE
Hey, Lil! (L\L looks up.) I love you.
LIL
(Laughs and starts to climb the stairs.) Don't you start that. We made a pact years ago in a dormitory room, never lovers, always friends.
ANNIE
I didn't mean that, dummy. I only meant you're my good buddy and I love you.
LIL
Come on, cut the crap. How many drinks have you had?
RAE
I hope you didn't bring the heads and guts in with you.
LIL
Nope. Threw them in the sea. From the sea we come, to the sea we returneth. . . .
RAE
I don't mind cooking them but I sure hate to clean them. (RAE takes fish, goes about preparing them.)
LIL
(Patting RAE'sassJ Just like a woman.
ANNIE
Watch that, buddy.
RAE
There's nothing more disgusting than a male chauvinist dyke.
LIL
(Approaching KITTY from behind.) Don't tell me! Yes! It must be! It is! Dr. Kitty Cochrane, High Priestess of Feminism, right in my very own living room. May I have your autograph? (KITTY looks at her coolly.) Come on, Kitty.
RITA
She's upset that you invited that straight woman.
LIL
Eva? She's just a nice, naive little lady, Kitty. We're going to be a lot more upsetting to her than she is to us.
ANNIE
Ah, but she has invaded our secret Isle of Lesbos. The enemy is in our camp, a traitor moves among us. . . .
RITA
Kitty does have to be very careful.
LIL
She seems like a nice woman. She's all right, Kitty, it's going to be okay. (Pause.) Knock, knock, Kitty, can you hear me through the closet door?
KITTY
If this woman blows my cover, if she goes to the media and announces Dr. Kitty Cochrane is a dyke (She wags her finger at LIU do you know how David Susskind would love to get hold of that?
LIL
Deny it, Kitty. Deny everything. You're so good at that.
KITTY
The public is not ready. The public is still trying to accept the concepts of equal rights and the clitoral orgasm. It would be a catastrophe for me to come out of the closet now. It would be as incredible as if—Gloria Steinem announced her intention to marry—Mario Thomas. The entire Movement would shudder and collapse.
RITA
Kitty is a figurehead, jutting boldly and courageously from the prow of the ship of human rights sailing through the treacherous sea of prejudice and ignorance. . . .
LIL
(To KITTYJ You didn't write that?
RITA
Yes, she did.
KITTY
I didn't use it. It was a first draft. Rita, how could you remember that?
RITA
I remember everything you write, Kitty. I have to type it four times. She does four drafts of everything.
LIL
(To KITTYJ I think I liked you better when you practiced medicine. You always looked so sexy in that white coat. (LIL, tired, sits.)
KITTY
How're you feeling, Lil?
LIL
Terrific.
KITTY
Really.
LIL
Don't start on me. You're not my doctor.
KITTY
You're under my supervision.
LIL
Bullshit. You have my records, that's all. I only agreed to that because my doctor wouldn't let me spend the summer out here otherwise. If I suddenly turn fuschia and collapse, do something. Otherwise, keep your distance, understand?
RITA
Kitty just wants to help you.
LIL
(To KITTYJ You don't even practice medicine any more.
RITA
She didn't go to Sweden this summer so she could stay here with you.
KITTY
Rita! That's not true, Lil. I never did like Sweden and I wouldn't miss a summer at the Cove for anything. (She feels LIL's forehead.) You're overdoing. You cannot stay on that beach all day. You can't take that much sun.
LIL
You try to take my pulse and I'll break your fingers. I'm fine. I feel just fine.
RAE
Hey, here she comes.
ANNIE
(Wiggling her eyebrows.) Nice. Very nice. You always did have good taste, Li I.
RAE
(To ANNIEJ Get in here and butter this skillet before I break it over your head.
ANNIE
I love a possessive woman.
RAE
Well, you've got one. She's skinny and she's got blue eyes—and if I catch you looking crocksided at her, I'll snatch you baldheaded.
EVA
(Calling.) Lil?
ANNIE
(At the door.) You've got the right place. Come on up.
RAE
(To ANNIEJ You're a married woman.
ANNIE
I can dream, can't I?
RAE
Skinny with blue eyes. Revs up her motor every time. Get in here. (She hauls ANNIE in by her britches pocket. This is a game between RAE and ANNIE. They are devoted to each other.)
EVA
(At door.) Lil?
LIL
Hi, Eva.
EVA
I didn't hear much noise but I was too excited to wait. I've been dressed and ready for an hour.
LIL
Donna and Sue are late, as usual, but everybody else is here. Come on in.
EVA
Do I look all right?
ANNIE
I think you look terrific. (To RAEJ Doesn't she look terrific?
RAE
Wonderful.
KITTY
(Inside, to RITAJ I hope she doesn't introduce us by last names.
RAE
(Wipes her hand on towel and extends it.) I'm Rae. Welcome to Bluefish Cove. The Li'l Abner character here is Annie Joseph.
ANNIE
Hi. We've been looking forward to meeting you. Lil told us all about you.
LIL
Not all. I don't know everything.
ANNIE
Hey, what are you drinking? Besides being assistant
EVA
Scotch and water, do you have that?
ANNIE
Sure. Coming up.
LIL
Rita Sanderson, Eva Margolis.
EVA
Hi.
KITTY
(Quickly.) I'm Katherine.
EVA
Hello.
ANNIE
You want this Scotch heavy or light?
EVA
Oh, light, please, I'm not a big drinker. Did you say your name is Annie Joseph?
ANNIE
That's right.
EVA
Are you the sculptress?
KITTY
Sculptor.
ANNIE
It doesn't matter. I make sculptures.
EVA
I took a class in art appreciation last year—we studied you.
ANNIE
Thank you.
EVA
I never met a sculptress.
RITA
(Being helpful.) Sculptress sounds like she does a little less of it a little less well.
RAE
Bull!
KITTY
(To RAEJ We really need a new word altogether. We need to develop our own language.
EVA
(To KITTY J You must be a feminist! I'm trying to become one. I'm reading that new book by Dr. Cochrane right now
ANNIE
(To LILJ Do I have to answer that?
EVA
Oh, do. You'll love it. It'll change your life. I know most men get very uptight about their wives reading feminist literature —George nearly went wild when I bought this book by Dr. Cochrane. He said his secretary read it and got so uppity he had to fire her. And of course he blames Dr. Cochrane and her book for the fact I left him.
RAE
It wouldn't be the first time Dr. Cochrane's been blamed for a breakup.
EVA
But it's not true. It's really not. I would have eventually left, anyway. I mean, our marriage just wasn't working. We tried everything. We really did. (To RITAJ Have you read Dr. Cochrane's book?
RITA
Well, yes, I have.
EVA
She's wonderful.
RITA
She's marvelous.
EVA
I would have left George anyway but Dr. Cochrane's book made me feel good about it—as if it were a beginning, not an end.
KITTY
What a lovely thing to say.
RITA
(To ANNIEJ You see? She is a figurehead, jutting boldly and courageously from the prow of the ship of human rights.
EVA
She's the most important woman in the twentieth century, that's what I think. Kitty Cochrane is going to change the world.
ANNIE
(To LI LJ She can't hold out against this kind of flattery —I give her fifteen more minutes.
LI L
Fifteen more seconds. Bet you ten bucks.
EVA
If any of you haven't read the book, I'll let you have my copy when I'm finished. Just don't tell your husbands where you got it from. I'm in the last chapter now and I have savored every word. I'm telling you, you don't know what it is to be a woman until you've read Dr. Kitty Cochrane.
KITTY
I'm really thrilled the book has had such meaning for you.
EVA
Oh, it has. It saved my life.
KITTY
Really?
EVA
Oh, yes.
LIL
(To ANNIEJ Watch this. fKITTY hesitates a moment) Now.
KITTY
I am Dr. Kitty Cochrane.
LIL
(To ANNIEJ Ten bucks. Fork over.
EVA
(Stunned.) Really?
RITA
But Kitty, you said . . .
KITTY
Rita, I have an obligation to my public.
EVA
How terribly exciting.
RAE
(Handing out plates.) Okay, group, soup's on.
EVA
But everybody's not here. . . .
RAE
Like I used to say to my kids, you get here on time or your plate goes in the oven.
EVA
(To RAEJ When is your husband coming?
RAE
My husband? Coming? Oh, he's not. He won't be here. We were divorced nine years ago.
EVA
Oh. What about your children?
RAE
What about them?
ANNIE
They're on their own. One of them's bumming around Oregon and the other one's in summer school in the city.
EVA
You have children, too?
ANNIE
No, I just feel like Rae's are half mine.
EVA
(Befuddled.) You're neighbors.
RAE
No, we live together.
EVA
Oh. I don't have children now. We had a son but— (To KITTY, who is cringing.) —you have children?
KITTY
Oh, no, I don't. (Quickly.) I delivered 273 of them, however, and what a glorious thing it is to bring new life into the world.
RITA
I almost had a baby once. (Everyone stares at her, surprised.) I was pregnant when I was in college. The boy was very considerate. He paid for the abortion. It was a little girl.
EVA
I used to want a little girl. I wanted her to look just like me. My immortality, I guess. (To KITTYJ Your book says a woman has the right to control her own body. My husband, George, thinks that's a mortal sin. George thinks a lot of things are mortal sins. Like the things you say in your book about marital sex —
DONNA
Wait, Sue!
SUE
Honey, I told you that you couldn't walk this beach in those sandals. If you'd wear sensible sneakers. . . .
DONNA
The sandals make my ankles look thinner.
SUE
If your ankles got any thinner, your feet would break off. Come on.
DONNA
The sandals are sexier. Too bad Gucci isn't imprinted on the back of them.
SUE
I could stamp Saks Fifth Avenue on your ass.
DONNA
I'd like to have a pair of these in white, too. Can we order them by phone?
SUE
On one condition. Don't flirt with Lil tonight.
DONNA
Flirt with Lil?
SUE
Don't look dumb. You always flirt with Lil.
DONNA
Oh, Sue.
SUE
Ever since you had that brief affair with her . . .
DONNA
I never had an affair with Lil.
SUE
Don't lie to me. Kitty told me all about it. You and Lil leaping out a motel window.
DONNA
Kitty made up that story.
SUE
Why would Kitty make up a story like that?
DONNA
I don't know but she did. Why on earth would I want Lil Zalinski when I've got you? I bet Lil never made more than fifteen thousand dollars a year in her whole life.
SUE
She's good looking. She's reputed to be dynamite in the sack. She had you once and dropped you like a hot potato. My baby doesn't like to get dumped.
DONNA
They have these sandals in blue, too.
SUE
Have a heart, will you?
DONNA
I saw a terrific denim pantsuit in Lord & Taylor.
SUE
Whatever you want, Donna, just don't flirt with Lil tonight. I may be a fool but I don't want to look like one. Leave me some pride, huh?
DONNA
Don't you even feel sorry for Lil? Don't you feel guilty? You're ten years older than she is and you're still healthy as a horse.
SUE
When you're born into my financial bracket, you feel sorry for everybody, guilty about everything—and you learn very quickly that you can't do a damn thing about other people's bad luck. Two pairs of sandals and a pantsuit, that's all you want? You have a tragic flaw, Donna. You never gamble for high enough stakes. I might have gone for a Mercedes. (She pats DONNA's rump.) Keep moving, honey. We're late already. Go on.
DONNA
(Climbingsteps.) YOO-HOO!
SUE
(As they enter.) Only an hour late, we're improving.
RAE
Come on in, your plates are in the oven.
ANNIE
(To EVA J They're always late. Donna has to change clothes twenty times.
EVA
I changed clothes four times tonight, myself.
RAE
Sue McMillan, Donna Atterly, Eva Margolis. Eva's got Holly House this season.
SUE
Welcome. The two who had it last year fought nightly, kept the whole Cove in a state of crisis. I hope you're happily paired up with someone.
EVA
No, I'm not.
SUE
Oh, dear. I was hoping for some peace and quiet.
RITA
Eva just broke up—
SUE
Well, we've all been through that—
RITA
With her husband. She's been married for twelve years.
DONNA
To a man?
EVA
What else? (There is an awkward silence.) Well, don't worry, I won't burden you with the boring details. Other people's divorces are a dull subject of conversation.
RAE
We were just discussing our children.
DONNA
Children?
RAE
Well, I do have two, you know.
EVA
(To DONNAJ Do you have children?
DONNA
Me?
EVA
Well, I'm sure you will. You're young yet. Are you married?
DONNA
Married? Me?
ANNIE
(To DONNAJ You're not married.
DONNA
No, I 'm not married.
EVA
But your last name is different from your mother's.
DONNA
My mother?
LIL
She's not her mother.
DONNA
Sue? No, she's not my mother.
EVA
I'm sorry.
SUE
It's all right. It's an understandable mistake.
DONNA
You didn't think it was understandable when the maitre d' at Lutece said it. You nearly bit his head off.
EVA
I'm sorry. I just assumed . . .
SUE
Forget it. All right? (She moves to the window, embarrassed.)
ANNIE
Honey, did you put coffee on?
DONNA
Now see what you've done? She'll give me a hard time for the rest of the night.
EVA
I've apologized. I don't know what else to do.
DONNA
Well, it was a dumb thing to say.
LIL
Donna!
EVA
I thought it was a perfectly reasonable assumption. What is she, your aunt?
DONNA
Are you putting me on? (To LILJ Where'd you find her?
KITTY
(Quickly.) I have a new book coming out. In the fall.
DONNA
She's going to give me hell all night because of you.
RITA
Kitty's new book is really very exciting. I've read it, you know. I typed it.
DONNA
Jesus H. Christ. (She glances toward SUEJ
RAE
(Seizing the situation.) Look how clear it is tonight. You can see Connecticut! (She goes to window and puts her arm around SUE, comfortingly.) I bet it's beautiful from the beach. Lil, why don't you take Eva down and show her the Connecticut skyline from the beach? Coffee will be another ten minutes.
LIL
Would you like that?
EVA
(Anxious to get out of there.) Yes. Yes, I would.
DONNA
You better get your act together or this summer is going to be a real mess.
ANNIE
Be careful on the steps, it's dark and those planks are
KITTY
(Watching them go.) Dear God in Heaven.
ANNIE
Speak to her for us, Kitty. She listens to you.
KITTY
Sue, you've got to do something about her. (She means DONNAJ
DONNA
About me? You better do something about her. Is Lil making it with her or what?
ANNIE
Poor Eva. She doesn't know what the hell is going on.
RAE
It must be awful for her.
DONNA
Awful for her? She hurt Sue's feelings.
SUE
Since when have you cared about that?
DONNA
I care. I've stuck around three years, I must care.
SUE
(Touched.) Come on then, give your old Mom a hug and kiss.
DONNA
Just a minute. I want to see what Lil's up to down there.
SUE
That's none of your business.
ANNIE
(Looking out the window.) That's what I'd say if they were doing something but they're not doing anything.
KITTY
Give Lil time.
RAE
I don't think that's what Lil has on her mind this summer.
ANNIE
Why not? If I were Lil, that's exactly what I'd have on my mind.
RAE
Kitty? Is she going to make it through the summer?
KITTY
The chemotherapy appears to have had a positive effect. There's no sign of new growth.
ANNIE
So she could get well and live for years.
KITTY
She could.
RITA
But, Kitty, you said that practically never happens, not with that kind of cancer. You said it moves so fast.
KITTY
(Snaps.) There is no indication of new growth at the present time.
RITA
But you said . . .
KITTY
It doesn't matter what I said, Rita. The practice of medicine is not an exact science. And I'm no expert in this field, don't ask me!
RITA
You are an expert, Kitty. You were an expert.
KITTY
Never.
RITA
It was your field of specialty!
KITTY
Don't tell me what I did, Rita!
RITA
You said you couldn't stand to watch people dying. You said you had to lie all the time and give people hope when you didn't think there was any.
KITTY
Rita, for God's sake!
RITA
These are your friends, Kitty, and they ought to know-she's not pushy and self-centered the way you think. She's kind and sensitive and caring. . . .
KITTY
Rita, Rita! What am I going to do with you?
RITA
I'm telling them because I love you.
KITTY
I know that! I just don't know how to shut you up!
RITA
She's angry at me that I told her secret.
RAE
It's not a secret, honey.
SUE
It's a charade. She wants us to play it with her, so we do.
DONNA
It's not all a charade. Kitty can be very pushy and self-centered. And mean. She can be very mean.
KITTY
And loud. I can be very loud. You can hear me clear through a motel room door.
DONNA
I haven't the foggiest notion what you're talking about.
RAE
Hold it! RING! Into your corners, ladies. We all agreed no fights this summer. We're going to make this summer perfect
DONNA
What is she doing down there?
SUE
Will you get away from that window?
DONNA
I'm not flirting with her. I'm watching her.
SUE
Well, don't.
RAE
Hey, hey, take it easy, Sue.
DONNA
She can't help herself, she's menopausal.
KITTY
(Clinically.) Are you really?
DONNA
She has no interest in sex, she flies off the handle all the time.
RAE
According to Kitty's book, none of those symptoms come with menopause. That's an old wive's tale.
DONNA
Sue says she's menopausal, says it herself.
RAE
Kitty's book says . . .
SUE
Fuck what Kitty's book says. How would Kitty know?
KITTY
Don't get so upset, Sue. There's nothing to get so upset about.
SUE
She makes me feel so completely inadequate.
DONNA
I don't make you feel any way—don't blame me for your own insecurities.
ANNIE
(To SUE J Why do you continue to put up with that?
SUE
Because I love her.
DONNA
Do you really? Say that again. I like to hear you say that.
SUE
I can't. Donna, you're driving me crazy
DONNA
Hey, wait\ Sue! I was only kidding! Where's your sense of humor?
KITTY
(At window, looking down at beach.) I don't like the looks of that.
ANNIE
(Looking, too.) Naw, they're just talking.
KITTY
They've been talking too long. Straight ladies can be very dangerous. They tend to toy with our affections.
ANNIE
Well, you're certainly the expert on that subject.
KITTY
(Starchily.) Lil does not need to be toyed with this summer.
RITA
I had a college roommate like that. We'd make out all night and then she'd get up in the morning and babble on about how she loved her boyfriend. I thought for months I was hallucinating.
KITTY
I want this summer to be as pleasant and serene as possible.
ANNIE
Lil can take care of herself. She can. I think she can.
LIL
(As though concluding a description.) . . . and to the left, that's the yacht basin. July 4th, they'll race, a hundred boats with spinnakers—it's really breathtaking.
EVA
You love it here, don't you?
LIL
It's my favorite place in all the world. I wish I'd found it sooner. This is only my fourth summer at the Cove.
EVA
Well, think of it this way. You have forty summers ahead of you. I think I'll head back to my cabin now. Thanks for inviting me.
LIL
It was awful for you, wasn't it? I'm sorry. The whole thing was just a terrible mistake.
EVA
I don't understand! I tried to be polite and sociable.
LI L
You were speaking another language.
EVA
I thought I had it figured out—no men, no husbands-then Rae started talking about her children.
LIL
Lesbians have children, too. Some lesbians do.
EVA
I feel like such a fool. Why didn't you just tell me?
LIL
I couldn't. I couldn't just say, all the women in this cove are lesbians—because I don't have the right to make that kind of announcement for them. They have to make the decision to tell that themselves and everybody doesn't make the same decision at the same time—it's a mess, that's what it is, a mess. It's hard on us and it's hard on you. I'm sorry.
EVA
They're probably up there right now, laughing ?. what an idiot I made of myself.
LIL
No, nobody wanted to hurt you or embarrass you, Eva. I should never have invited you tonight—but at the time I asked you, I thought you were one of us.
EVA
You what?
LIL
It was a logical assumption. Marge Eaton has never, in recorded history, rented a cabin in Bluefish Cove to a heterosexual.
EVA
Never?
LIL
Bluefish Cove has been a gay women's haven for thirty years or more. These cabins were built by two elderly "maiden ladies"—that's what the locals called them. One of them's still alive in a nursing home, up island. Couple of years ago, a bunch of us drove up to see her. Annie took some photographs of the yacht race on the Sound and Rae brought her a bouquet of lavender. She never did understand who we were or why we were there. She kept staring at us and twice she looked around as though there were someone standing behind her and she said, "Elizabeth, I believe we have some company." Elizabeth was her lover's name, I guess. I don't know what will happen to the Cove when the old lady dies.
EVA
You could buy it. You could all get together and buy it.
LIL
Maybe Sue will buy it. She has the money to do it. Or Kitty.
EVA
I can't believe that Kitty Cochrane . . .
LIL
Yeah, well, don't talk about it, huh? It really could hurt her career.
EVA
George always claimed that women's libbers were a bunch of .. .
LIL
Dykes? Not all—but some. After all, dykes are women, too. I'll call Marge tomorrow. I'll explain to her and maybe she'll cancel your rental contract.
EVA
I don't know where else to go. I need a friend now. I'd wanted it to be you.
LIL
I'm not a vampire, for heaven's sake. I don't go around pouncing on pretty women. I know how to be friends. But you won't be comfortable here, Eva. You're out of place.
EVA
I'm out of place everywhere, Lil. I'm out of place here, in my marriage, in my life. And I'm terrified to be alone. I've never been alone.
LIL
Everybody's alone, Eva, sooner or later—we do all the important things alone.
EVA
Not me.
LIL
You're alone getting born, giving birth, dying. Oh, people may be standing around you, watching you, but you do the thing alone. You fall in love alone. Yes, you do. It's not like dancing the tango, two people don't fall in love in lockstep. One falls first, one falls later and maybe one never falls at all. You say Kitty's book changed your life—it didn't. It might have given you some courage but you're the one who changed your life, Eva. You rented the cabin, you spoke to me on the beach, you asked me to be your friend—you're not nearly so dependent as you think you are, Eva. Wherever you go this summer, I expect you'll do just fine.
EVA
Those women in your cabin tonight, they all seem so independent. And you, you don't need anybody. I admire that. You're not afraid of anything. George says women can't get along without men. Ha. I wish he could have seen what I saw tonight.
LIL
Eva, forget what you saw tonight, huh? Go back to your cabin, get a good night's sleep and I'll call Marge for you in the morning. Go on. Oh Jesus, don't start crying.
EVA
I'm not crying! I'm mad. I'm scared. You don't want me here and I don't know where to go . . . you were going to be my friend . . .
LIL
Eva, I am your friend. Everything's going to be just fine, you'll see. Now, go on. It's freezing out here. Good night.
ANNIE
Here she comes.
KITTY
Alone?
RAE
Well, hey there. We were getting worried about you.
LIL
Sorry. She was pretty upset. This has been a stinking party, hasn't it?
DONNA
It's early yet. We can still party.
SUE
(Exiting bathroom.) We're going home now, Donna.
DONNA
Why?
SUE
I'm tired. I'm menopausal!
DONNA
What a drag!
SUE
We'll see you on the beach tomorrow, okay? Donna?
DONNA
Li I, want to go sailing tomorrow?
SUE
Donna.
DONNA
You don't like to sail. It makes you seasick. Lil?
LIL
(Her attention is toward the window.) I'll take a raincheck, Donna.
SUE
Donna, come on.
DONNA
If you change your mind, Lil . . .
SUE
Donna. (They exit.)
ANNIE
I'd like to strangle that kid. What a cunt.
KITTY
Annie! Never use a woman's genitalia as a derogatory word. What kind of feminism is that?
ANNIE
Kitty, m'dear, it has been my experience that in any group of men you will find a number of pricks. And occasionally, mind you, occasionally, in a group of fine upstanding women like ourselves, you will find a cunt. Donna is one. She wants Lil's body.
KITTY
She's had Lil's body.
ANNIE
Well, apparently she didn't get enough of it.
LIL
How could she? Kitty was breaking down the motel room door.
KITTY
She isn't good for you.
LIL
Don't worry. I can't be bothered. I haven't the energy or time.
RAE
That's the most sensible thing I've heard you say since I've known you.
KITTY
(At door.) All right, gang. I'm going into town at ten a.m. tomorrow morning. If you want anything, write it down and attach cash. Last year, I managed to lose a lot of money. "Oh, Kitty, pick up some aspirin for me, will you?" "Toothpaste, we're nearly out of toothpaste." "Tampax, I forgot to get Tampax." This year, Rita's keeping track and I'm going to bill you.
LIL
Once a nitpicker, always a nitpicker; becoming famous hasn't changed you one damn bit.
KITTY
Last chance. Night all.
RITA
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner, Rae.
RAE
That Rita's got good manners. She's the only one who said how good the meal was, the only one. The rest of you bums just took it for granted.
ANNIE
I never take you for granted, love, never. My life with you is a glorious adventure.
RAE
Are you making that up?
ANNIE
My nights are rich with mystery, my dreams breathless with expectation.
RAE
You read that somewhere!
ANNIE
I think I read it in a Kitty Cochrane book. (RAE smacks her with dishtowel.) On the other hand, maybe I overheard Li I saying that to Donna! (Again, a smack.)
ANNIE
(Sees LILJ Are you okay, Lil?
LIL
Just tired.
ANNIE
Well, they told you to expect that, didn't they? Maybe you should take a nap in the afternoon.
LIL
I don't have time to take a nap.
ANNIE
Hey. (She tries to comfort LIL but LIL brushes her off.) You like her, huh? I know you. Do I know you or do I know you? I know you. You like her, huh? Huh? Am I right? You like her! Uh-huh!
LIL
(Laughs.) Kind of.
ANNIE
See there? Who knows you? I know you. Nobody knows you like I do. Right?
LIL
Right.
ANNIE
I love you, good buddy.
LIL
You said that earlier. Don't get mushy.
ANNIE
I know. My loving you is not enough. But just the same, I do. (Calls to RAE J Come on, ol' lady, we're going home. Don Juan here is plumb wore out.
RAE
All right, all right, I'm just finishing up.
ANNIE
You need anything, Lil?
LIL
Yeah. Time.
ANNIE
You really like her.
LIL
She needs somebody. So do I.
ANNIE
Well then?
LIL
No. Wouldn't work.
ANNIE
Never say never.
LIL
She's straight.
ANNIE
Maybe she is and maybe she isn't.
LIL
She is.
ANNIE
I thought Rae was, too. Married lady with chubby babies hanging on her skirt. Then she attacked me.
LIL
It's not the same thing. You could offer her a life together.
ANNIE
You don't know yet what you could offer her—it's not the quantity of time, Lil, it's the quality—and you've got lots of quality, my friend.
LIL
You know, the one thing I've always had going for me is I know who I am. I know who I am, what I am, and what I'm capable of doing. Most of the time, I actually know what I want.
ANNIE
And?
LIL
She doesn't. She doesn't know a thing about herself. I don't make brass sculptures that last forever. I never wrote a book or had a baby. I'd like to pass something on.
RAE
(To ANNIEJ Okay, hotshot, let's go.
ANNIE
We'll see you in the morning?
LI L
Thanks, both of you.
RAE
When you get to feeling better, you can cook for us and wash our dishes.
ANNIE
Get some sleep, will you?
LIL
I'll try. I get tired but my mind won't stop. I don't want to waste time sleeping.
ANNIE
I bet you could work up a terrific erotic dream tonight. Now, I don't consider that a waste of time!
LIL
(Grins.) You may be right about that.
ANNIE
Do I know you, huh?
LIL
Will you get outta here? (They exit. LIL straightens up, unmakes the bed, sits on it, despondent. To herself.) It isn't fair. (She examines ANNIE's sculpture on table, replaces it, lights a cigarette, then hurls the ashtray on the floor.) Goddammit. (She bursts into tears and races into the bathroom.)
LIL
Who is it?
EVA
I'm too upset to sleep.
LIL
(Notgoing to door.) It's late, Eva. I'm very tired.
EVA
But I need to talk.
LIL
(Reluctantly coming to door.) We'll talk tomorrow. Life doesn't look so damned dramatic in the sunlight.
EVA
Have you been crying? Your face is swollen.
LIL
Naw. Catching a cold or something.
EVA
Your eyes are puffy.
LIL
Probably an allergic reaction to the sun. I stayed on the beach too long this afternoon.
EVA
I warned you. Bet your shoulders are blistered.
LIL
No, they're fine.
EVA
See? You ought to put something on them. You have some Noxema?
LIL
No, Eva. I'm just fine. I'm terrific, wonderful. Good night.
EVA
It gets cold here at night, doesn't it? (She shivers visibly.) That sea breeze. . . .
LIL
All right, Eva, but not for long. I've got to get some sleep.
EVA
I used to talk to my little boy, Lenny, late at night like this. I'd sit by his bed and talk and he'd listen to me. He lived to be six years old. I taught him to read—he loved to read. He'd read to me out loud. I'd never been much of a reader myself, until Lenny came along. Then I started going to the library and bookstores to get books for him—and I'd pick up something for myself. In a way, you could say Lenny taught me to read. I think George thought he was somehow responsible for Lenny's heart. George thinks he's responsible for everything. He's not a mean man, he's just set in his ways. My mother wanted me to marry an adventurer—she was always dreaming about adventures. Going places no one else had gone, doing things no one had done —she never went anywhere herself, of course, it all happened in her mind. She wanted me to have adventures for her. And I haven't had a one. . . .
LIL
Oh, I'm sure you have, Eva. Coming to the party tonight was a kind of adventure, wasn't it? Maybe not a pleasant one, but-
EVA
I bet you have adventures all the time.
LI L
Don't make a heroine out of me, Eva.
EVA
But I admire you.
EVA
Were you and Kitty . . .
LIL
For a while.
EVA
But now, you're not . . .
LIL
It's not a time for me to make commitments. I was never much for making commitments, anyway.
EVA
How did you know you were?
LIL
(Challengingher.) What?
EVA
(Forcing herself to say it.) Gay.
LIL
I fell in love with a woman. (Snaps.) What is this, twenty questions?
EVA
I'm sorry—I just don't know anything about it and —
LIL
Okay. I knew very early, some people do. I knew when I couldn't take my eyes off my high school English teacher, when my knees quivered every time my chemistry lab partner brushed her elbow against mine. When I could hardly wait for double dates to end so my girlfriend and I could cuddle in her bed together and demonstrate to one another what the boys had done to us. I knew it didn't mean a thing to her—that when I touched her, she was pretending that I was a boy. But I wasn't pretending. She was the real thing for me. I didn't know there were so many others like me until I got to college and met Annie. Annie swears that she was born gay. She was playing doctor with little girls in kindergarten. She's never had the slightest heterosexual tendency.
EVA
So, it was you and Annie?
LIL
Oh, goodness, no. Never. Annie and I are best buddies. It was Annie who showed me the gay bars and restaurants, the gay resort areas—we gays are kind of like the hobbits—no matter how repressive earthlings get, we continue to thrive in Middle Earth. We're survivors. We straddle both worlds and try to keep our balance.
EVA
Kitty Cochrane's book says you can be bisexual. She says it's the most natural way to be.
LIL
(Sardonically.) She does, huh?
EVA
I'd really never thought about that before.
LIL
(Knowing what is coming.) Well, Kitty also claims a mature person should not expect their partner to remain monogamous, that jealousy is an immature response. And I'm here to tell you that what Kitty says and what Kitty does are not the same thing. Kitty is a very possessive lady.
EVA
You don't like her, do you? You're always putting her down.
LIL
Like Kitty? I adore Kitty. She's my good friend. I might poke a little fun at Dr. Kitty Cochrane, feminist soothsayer, but that's just a mask she wears. The real Kitty is an old-time friend of mine. We've been through a lot together. Kitty's all right. I can count on Kitty to come through.
EVA
Li I, were you ever attracted to a man?
LI L
Are you writing a book or what? It's after midnight!
EVA
(Flustered.) No, I'm just trying to . . .
LIL
(Challenging.)Jo what?
EVA
(Quietly.) To understand. You think I'm boring, don't you?
LIL
No
EVA
Just another runaway housewife.
LIL
I don't think you're boring, Eva. You're lonely, vulnerable, curious—and that combination scares the hell out of me. fLIL smiles at EVA J
EVA
(Shyly.) I thought about you ever since I saw you on
LIL
I'm not a curiosity, Eva. I'm not an experiment, not an adventure. On the other hand, I have never, repeat never, gone shopping with anybody for matching sheets and drapes at Bloomingdale's.
EVA
I understand.
LIL
(Touchingher face.) Do you?
EVA
(Bravely.) I'm not as naive as you think I am.
LIL
You're not? fLIL touches EVA seductively.)
EVA
All right, I am.
LIL
Uh-huh. (She guides EVA toward door.) Go home, Eva. It's late, I'm tired, I'll see you on the beach tomorrow. We'll spend the afternoon together on the beach, all right? (She touches EVA's lips with her fingers. Sighs.) My mother must have told me fifty times, never kiss on the first date.
EVA
You're a puritan.
LIL
No, but my mother is. This is the first time I've ever taken her advice. Goodnight. (EVA starts to descend stairs, looks back.) Goodnight, Eva.
DONNA
Don't they ever get out of bed?
RAE
Why don't you mind your own business?
DONNA
Well, they can't be doing it all the time. It's physically impossible.
RITA
Kitty says women are capable of many multiple or-
DONNA
Well, I think it's perverted. We've hardly seen Lil all summer.
RAE
It's Lil's summer. If she wants to spend it in bed, let her.
DONNA
Well, it isn't fair.
KITTY
You'd think it was fair enough if you were the one in bed with her. /"SUE turns and catches KITTYS eye. To SUEJ Sorry.
ANNIE
You deserve better than that, Sue.
SUE
Do I?
ANNIE
Yes. She uses you.
SUE
They all do. She's not the first pretty young thing I've kept. I don't expect she'll be the last.
ANNIE
You're a nice lady. You don't have to buy love.
SUE
I have never known, in fact, who loved me and who loved my bankbook—except with this one. I don't have to lie awake nights saying to myself, "But she said this," or, "She did this," and, "Maybe that does mean she loves me"—with Donna, I know exactly where I stand. (Lightly.) It hurts less that way, Annie.
KITTY
(Calling to DONNAJ Come down from there, leave her alone.
DONNA
None of you are concerned about Li I. (She comes down.) You don't care whether you see her this summer or not. You don't care if you ever see her again.
RAE
Of course we care.
DONNA
Any day could be her last.
KITTY
Oh, don't be so dramatic, Donna. People in Lil's condition just don't keel over suddenly. She'll have adequate warning and so will we.
RAE
I saw them walking on the beach this morning. Lil looked fine, her color's good. And I don't know when I've seen her look so happy.
RITA
I saw Eva in the supermarket. She looks good, too. She was all excited about moving into Lil's apartment in the city—she said they'd signed a lease to take the cabin again next summer.
KITTY
She said what?
RAE
She hasn't told her!
KITTY
Why didn't you tell me that?
RITA
I told you I saw her.
KITTY
But you didn't tell me that.
RITA
You were writing. I didn't want to break your concentration.
RAE
Annie! f ANN IE leaps from rock to shore, turns to offer SUE a hand.)
ANNIE
Yeah. I don't know what it is Lil does to catch fish off this rock but I don't seem to have any luck at all.
RAE
Did you know that Lil hasn't told Eva?
ANNIE
Hasn't told her what? (Pauses, realizes.) She hasn't?
KITTY
I understand it but I'm not happy about it. Lil's going through denial. It's natural—but in these circumstances—
ANNIE
I wouldn't tell her, either.
DONNA
I would—it would be so—romantic. Like Camille.
SUE
Will you shut up?
ANNIE
(To SUEJ Thank you. That's a step in the right direction, Sue.
RAE
But it isn't right, not to tell her. Eva ought to know.
ANNIE
As long as Lil feels good, I don't see why she has to tell her. Lil doesn't want to be looked on as a dying woman, for Christ's sake. Would you? She's in love, she feels wonderful, she wants to live. Leave her alone.
DONNA
You'd think she'd want to spend her last days with her friends. She just met Eva—she's known us for years.
ANNIE
(To SUEJ Will you do something about that brat before I drown her?
DONNA
I don't have to take that from you. I don't have to stand here and be insulted by a bunch of dykes.
ANNIE
Oh, and what are you, sweetheart, chopped liver?
DONNA
I'm bisexual. Or I could be if I wanted to. When we took that cruise to St. John's last year, I could have had every man on shipboard, couldn't I, Sue?
SUE
To tell the truth, dear, I thought you did.
DONNA
Well, I didn't! But nobody could blame me if I had. I certainly don't get any at home!
RAE
Donna!
DONNA
(To ANNIEJ You don't care about Lil. You're just going to let her stay up in that cabin with that stranger all summer long. She's going to die and we'll never see her again and you don't care. I'm going back to the cabin, Sue. (She hobbles off.) Sue? I'm going back to the cabin, aren't you coming? (No answer.) Sue!
SUE
(Not moving.) No. You're a big girl, Donna. You can get here to there alone. (DONNA is stunned.) Go on. (DONNA, puzzled and disgruntled, hobbles off.)
ANNIE
(To SUE.) Good girl.
SUE
She's spoiled rotten. And I'm the one who spoiled her. She was a perfectly ordinary little girl from Brooklyn when I met her. Oh, she'd gone to modeling school but she worked as a trainee on the Information Desk at Bloomingdale's. I was looking for the sale in Sportswear and she directed me first to Home Furnishings and then to Men's Outerwear and finally to Lingerie. She had a wonderful sense of humor about her inefficiency and never once apologized for sending me on wild goose chases all over the store. Donna was not always what she is now. I played a part in creating the monster. And like Dr. Frankenstein, I am somewhat reluctant to release my creation on the world.
EVA
How big is your dining room?
LIL
(Sticking her head out the bathroom door, washing her face.) What?
EVA
Your dining room?
LIL
Our dining room.
EVA
How big is it?
LIL
(Coming out, still scrubbing her face.) It's very tiny. Actually, it's not a dining room, it's an alcove. It's, oh, I don't
EVA
Will it hold an oak table and six bentwood chairs?
LIL
Sweetheart, this is a very small apartment.
EVA
But I have so much gorgeous furniture. Do I have to leave it all for George? fl_IL goes back to bathroom.) We can get a bigger apartment.
LIL
(Returning.) Honey, I can afford this apartment.
EVA
Well, I can get a job. Some kind of job. Can't I? Do you want me to work?
LIL
(From bathroom.) It's not what I want, Eva, it's what you want. What do you want? (L\L exits the bathroom, finished.) What do you want?
EVA
I wish you'd stop asking me that.
LIL
I don't want you to do anything to please me. Just please yourself.
EVA
But I don't know what I want. Except you. I want you. Always.
LIL
(Efficiently.) It may come as a big surprise to you, my darling, but there is more to life than— /"EVA kisses her lightly, seductively, then moves away.) —uhhhh. (L\L follows. The following dialogue occurs during a slow-moving chase— EVA seducing, LIL reaching out, EVA moving away. It's a lovers' dance.)
EVA
More to life than what?
LI L
Don't listen to me. I don't know what I 'm talking about.
EVA
More to life than sex?
LI L
Some people say that but they lie. It's a pack of lies.
EVA
You mean love does make the world go round?
LIL
Oh, definitely.
EVA
Resolves all problems?
LIL
Absolutely.
EVA
Love conquers all?
LIL
No doubt about it.
EVA
My mother used to tell me, "Marry a rich man. Love doesn't pay the rent."
LIL
Your mother is a callous woman.
EVA
Will a six-foot couch fit in your living room?
LIL
Our living room.
EVA
Will it?
LIL
Honey, a six-foot person will hardly fit in that living room.
EVA
What am I supposed to do with all my furniture?
LIL
Sell it, store it, give it to George, give it to your mother, give it to the Salvation Army, burn it, just stop talking about it, put that damn list away and come here.
EVA
My mother always told me to plan for the future.
LIL
I can see your mother and I are not going to get along.
EVA
We have so much future to plan for, Lil— so many years together, so many things to do—do you ski?
LIL
Do I ski? I was the college downhill champion.
EVA
I'm the snowplow queen myself. You can follow my trail by the sitzmarks. But I love it. Imagine riding beside you in a chairlift. I've always had a fantasy about making love in a chairlift. Everybody on the mountain's craning their necks looking but they can't get to me and my lover, we're isolated, out of reach, oblivious to their stares and shouts, caught in the frenzy of our insatiable desire. Want to try that?
LIL
Nope. You might have gotten away with doing that with George but if you and I tried it, there'd be a sheriff waiting on the platform.
EVA
I never did it with George. George was never even in that fantasy.
EVA
Well, I didn't know any better. Let's go to Switzerland and ski the Alps. And Spain. You want to go to Spain? I've never been to Spain.
LI L
Nope. I don't want to go to Spain. They throw homosexuals in jail in Spain. They'll take one look at the way my knees quiver when you look at me and they'll put me in the hoosegow and throw away the key. Let's go to Amsterdam. We can get married in Amsterdam.
EVA
Really?
LIL
Yep, we're nice and legal there, just like ordinary folks. Want to marry me?
EVA
Ah, you say that to all your girls.
LIL
I never said it before in my whole life. Girl-Scout's honor. It might make your mother happy. She sounds like the kind of woman who doesn't want you to live in sin.
EVA
What am I going to tell her?
LIL
That you've left George.
EVA
I've already told her that. I called her the night I did it. She was hysterical for twenty minutes but she got over it. She and George never got along. I'm sure she's already called her friends to elicit names of suitable eligible men.
LIL
Tell her you have a roommate.
EVA
What if I tell her the truth?
LIL
Don't.
EVA
Why not?
LIL
Does she vote a liberal ticket? Did she march for civil rights? Did she protest the war in Viet Nam? Did she boycott grapes and support the draft evaders?
EVA
No.
LIL
Don't tell her then. It's ten to one she'll disown you as a pervert.
EVA
She wouldn't.
LIL
Mine did. Just say you have a roommate and keep your mouth shut. Unless, of course, you get off on verbal flagellation and suicide threats.
EVA
I don't want to have to lie to my mother. I've never lied to my mother.
LIL
Everybody has lied to their mother.
EVA
Well, not about anything important.
LIL
Annie's mother won't allow Rae in the house. Sue's brothers won't allow her to visit her nieces and nephews. Rita was trained to be a teacher, you know, junior high school math. Her father called the school board and reported her. My mother feigned
EVA
I don't want to lose my family—but I don't want to lie to them, either. I want them to share my happiness. I want them to know you and love you. . . .
LIL
Don't count on it, Eva. Don't tell them unless you're prepared to lose them. I don't think you should tell them anything at all, not yet. I mean, we're very new, you and me, and what if you change your mind, what if something happens— next year this time you could be married to some upstanding dentist in Westchester.
EVA
Lil! You don't mean that.
LIL
Why not?
EVA
I love you! This may have started out to be a summer fling but it's much more than that now—what's the matter with you?
EVA
But you love me—you said you love me. Or is that just part of the game, part of the malicious perversion?
LIL
I love you more than I have ever loved anyone. For the first time in my life, I understand why knights rode miles to slay a dragon for their lady's hand.
EVA
(Half-crying, half-laughing.) Li I.
LIL
And all those songs with "moon"and "June"and "croon," I thought they were pretty silly. Now, I'm whistling those tunes in the shower. Remember that song, "You're My Everything"? I used to hear that and say to myself, now what the hell does that mean, "You're my everything"? Nobody's anybody's everything. I was wrong.
EVA
Lil?
LIL
Yes, angel?
EVA
Are you ashamed of me? Do I embarrass you?
LIL
What?
EVA
You don't see your friends any more. Since I've been living here, you don't ever ask them over. I see them on the path and they ask how you are—they look at me funny as though I 've taken you away from them.
LIL
I'd rather be alone with you.
EVA
At first I thought they didn't like me. And maybe you
LI L
Eva—I 'm proud of you.
EVA
Do you know what tomorrow is?
LIL
Saturday?
EVA
It's our first anniversary. One month.
LIL
Oh, dear. If you cry because I forgot our first anniversary. . . .
EVA
Let's celebrate tomorrow night.
LIL
All right.
EVA
Invite your friends?
LIL
Not just the two of us?
EVA
We can't live in a vacuum forever. Besides, I want to show off. I want all your friends to see how much in love we are. I 'm not such a dummy as they thought.
LIL
All right, you asked for it! (She opens the door, runs partway down the steps.) Hey gang! Hey, down there! We're throwing a beach party tomorrow night—steamed clams and crabs and lobsters! It's our first anniversary! Bring your own booze—
LIL
Next year I'm going to buy some of that fire-starter, that stuff in cans. Trying to light a fire this big with drift and matches is an exercise in frustration,
ANNIE
I thought you were a Girl Scout, you got a merit badge in beach survival.
LIL
I did, I did, but I think I must have cheated—damned if I can remember how I did it.
ANNIE
You probably didn't do it at all. You charmed some little redhead into doing it for you.
LIL
That's not unlikely. That's how I passed Home Economics. Priscilla Miller, who could sew a seam straight as a ruler and fry an egg without breaking the yoke, lives forever in my grateful heart. (She stands up, breathes the sea air.) Annie, I feel terrific. I never felt so good in my whole life.
ANNIE
I'm glad, Lil. I'm happy for you. For both of you.
LIL
Doctors aren't infallible, you know. Sometimes these things just stop—the condition arrests itself, recedes, it goes away. When I was going to the clinic for chemotherapy, I met this woman whose tumor'd just stopped, disappeared, seventeen years
ANNIE
I've known you for a long time, Lil, and I don't think I 've ever seen you in love before. Not like this.
LIL
It's never been like this. I didn't know it could be like this. Is it like this for you and Rae?
ANNIE
Well, probably not exactly—well, yes, I guess so. I mean, we've kind of passed that stage where we can't keep our hands off each other, thank goodness. You mellow out after a while, you know.
LIL
You mean the honeymoon ends.
ANNIE
Yeah-but that's when the good stuff starts.
LIL
Couldn't be any better than this. In ten years, we'll match notes, okay?
ANNIE
You haven't told Eva, have you?
LIL
She asked about the scar. I told her I had a hysterectomy. Which is true. She doesn't need to know any more than that— what more is there? I feel terrific. They told me I'd start having short-term pain. I haven't felt a thing. I'm telling you, Annie, it's gone. I know it is.
DONNA
This is getting my shirt all dirty. fLIL takes the wood, DONNA brushes at her shirt.)
LIL
Come on gang, keep the driftwood coming.
SUE
(Depositing her load and collapsing on the beach.) Enough already!
RAE
(Out the cabin door.) Hey, we could use some help up here!
SUE
I volunteer! Anything to get out of this! (She gratefully climbs the steps.)
KITTY
(Dumping driftwood.) I really think this is enough, Lil. We're cooking seafood, not signalling for rescue.
LIL
One more. One more armful.
KITTY
You overdo, Lil. You always overdo.
RITA
(To KITTY) Is this it?
KITTY
She says one more. (Contemplates RITA's pile.) I'll take half of this, she'll never know the difference.
SUE
(Peering in pot.) Jesus, that thing's alive!
RAE
They're all alive. That's how you cook them, alive.
SUE
Well, I know that, but I thought you drugged them or something first.
RAE
Nope. Right into the fire, alive.
SUE
I wish I hadn't seen it. It looked directly at me.
EVA
I take it you don't cook.
SUE
Only under duress. If push comes to shove, I can put a TV dinner in the oven.
EVA
Donna does the cooking?
SUE
Are you kidding? In the city, the cook does the cooking. When we travel, the hotel does the cooking and out here, we eat two meals a day at Molly Pitcher's.
RAE
Can you count to eight? Then count out the paper napkins, forks, spoons, glasses, paper plates—put them in that box and carry them downstairs. (SUE grimaces and proceeds to do so.)
EVA
(To SUE J You travel all year round from place to place?
SUE
All my life. When I was growing up, it was Bar Harbor in the summer, a Massachusetts girls' school in the fall, Christmas in London, back to school for the winter, spring in Paris or Switzerland, back to Bar Harbor. There was a townhouse in the city we called home—my father lived there most of the time but the rest of us wafted in and out, on our way to somewhere else.
EVA
That's the kind of life my mother always said she wished that she could give me.
SUE
It was a nightmare.
EVA
I never went away to school. I went to a local college and lived at home. When George and I first married, we lived with his family for a year before we bought a place of our own. My mother was never crazy about George. She said that he was dull. If Lil were male, my mother would approve her as the perfect choice. We're going to travel, we're going to ski the Alps and Lil wants to take me to Amsterdam. Did you know you can get married in Amsterdam?
SUE
I thought you could get married anywhere.
EVA
A man and woman can get married anywhere. I mean Lil and me. We could get married in Amsterdam.
RAE
Whatever for?
EVA
Well, it would be kind of romantic.
SUE
For god's sake, don't tell Donna about it. She'd marry me, divorce me and wipe me out.
EVA
Oh, no she wouldn't.
RAE
Oh, yes she would.
EVA
Well, I'm glad I married George—I spent twelve years with him. If I'd just lived with him, if I didn't have a marriage contract, I wouldn't get a thing.
RAE
You may not get a thing. I didn't. Not one red cent. I put him through school, raised two kids, kept his house-now if he'd left me, I'd have had him by the short hairs. But I left him, see, and I left him for a woman. The only way he'd agree to let me keep the kids was if I forfeited my suit for child support. Annie's putting my kids through college.
EVA
But George and I bought that house together, we furnished it together, he made investments in the market for both of us.
RAE
In your name?
EVA
I don't know. George took care of those things.
RAE
Did he beat you up?
EVA
No!
RAE
Have a mistress?
EVA
Not that I know of—maybe.
RAE
Unless you can prove abuse or adultery, you're probably out of luck, sweetheart. At least in this state. You left him. And for heaven's sake, don't ever let him know you left him for a woman. Zilch. You'll get zilch.
EVA
But I never had to earn a living. George made good
RAE
Me, either. And I'm good at it. I like to make a home, I like to shop, cook, clean. When my kids act up or Annie and I have a fight, I like to get down on my knees with a scrub-brush and wash that kitchen floor until it squeaks. It's a blasphemous thing to say in this age of Kitty Cochrane feminism, but I like creating an environment that's warm and pretty for the people I love.
EVA
Do your kids understand—about you and Annie?
RAE
Oh, we worried ourselves sick about that. We practiced just how we were going to tell the kids. Before we got up the courage to do it, they told us. They'd known it all along. My daughter went through a bad period about it when she was thirteen, fourteen—you know girls that age can't stand to be the least bit different—having a lesbian mother was an embarrassment, I guess. Even now, I'm not as close to her as I'd like to be—we get along all right but something's missing between us. My boy, it didn't phase him. He's a good kid, hair down to his ass but a mother can't have everything. (She changes the subject abruptly.) Okay, Eva, grab that pot, will you? And can you carry this box, too? Be careful with that, hold it upright.
EVA
(Looking in box.) What is it?
RAE
Get your nose out of there. It's a surprise.
EVA
It's a cake!
SUE
(Looking.) "Happy Number One. And Many More."
RAE
And many more.
EVA
Well, I should hope so. It's only a month. I expect us to stay together until we're ninety.
ANNIE
Fire's going good.
DONNA
At last.
LIL
You haven't done a thing to help.
DONNA
I did so. I carried wood.
SUE
(Calls from above.) Donna! I could use some help with this.
DONNA
(Mimicking.) "Donna," "Donna."
ANNIE
Give her a break, will you? She's damned nice to you. Show some appreciation.
DONNA
She doesn't want me to be nice to her, don't you know that? If I were nice to her, she'd drop me in a minute. (DONNA goes to help.)
ANNIE
(To KITTY J You understand that?
KITTY
Yes.
ANNIE
You would.
KITTY
(As though from a textbook.) Sue lacks self-esteem so she asks Donna to reinforce that she, Sue, is, in fact, not worthy of receiving love. If Donna were to demonstrate affection for Sue, Sue would feel betrayed and her emotional dependence on Donna would no doubt cease. It's a classic interaction between neurotics—the symptoms vary from battering to emotional flagellation. It is not infrequently found in parent/child and employer/employee relationships as well as those of mates. In the case of Donna and Sue, Donna, as the flagellator, also experiences guilt because she does, in fact, harbor affection for Sue but she senses, accurately, that to demonstrate that affection would jeopardize the game on which their relationship is based. It is this guilt which causes Donna to act promiscuously as in the case of Lil where Donna wishes Lil to punish her in the same way Donna has punished Sue.
LIL
(To ANNIE J I'm sorry you asked that.
ANNIE
Not as sorry as I am.
RITA
(Who has been following this carefully.) You mean that Donna wants Lil to beat her up?
KITTY
Emotionally, dear, emotionally.
RITA
Because she feels guilty because she's so nasty to Sue.
KITTY
That's right.
RITA
Well, why as she so nasty to Sue?
ANNIE
Don't you say that again. I got a headache the first time. (To RITA J Donna is nasty to Sue because Sue's a sap and Donna's a cunt. (She dares KITTY to challenge that)
KITTY
Well, I suppose that's another way of putting it.
LIL
Where's the beer? You forgot the beer!
RAE
I set it on the counter. The big red cooler. I thought you had it, Sue.
SUE
I thought Donna got it.
DONNA
I only carried what you handed to me, Sue. I'm not a mind reader.
EVA
I'll go back up.
LIL
No, I'll go, honey.
ANNIE
Oh, no you don't. I'll go.
KITTY
(To LIL J Let Annie go. That cooler's heavy.
LIL
(Challengingher.) So what?
KITTY
Lil. Let Annie go.
LIL
No. I said I'm going.
ANNIE
(Pushing her aside gently.) Out of the way, pal.
LIL
(Seizing her.) I said I'm going. (Meanwhile, EVA is completely bewildered by all this.)
DONNA
(Grabbing LIL J Listen to Kitty, she's your doctor.
LIL
She's not my doctor. There's nothing wrong with me! Let me go, Annie. (ANNIE looks at KITTYJ Don't do this to me, Kitty.
KITTY
(To ANNIE J Let her go. (LIL races up the stairs.)
EVA
What was that about?
RAE
Rita? Give me a hand here, will you? Push back those coals, Annie, so we can dump the clams in.
EVA
(To RAE J What happened?
RAE
(Pats EVA's hand.) Nothing, honey, nothing happened. Sue?
SUE
Don't you ask me to pick up one of those evil-looking critters.
EVA
(Persistent.) Something happened but I didn't understand.
ANNIE
(To KITTYJ She swears she feels fine.
KITTY
Maybe she does.
ANNIE
She says being in love has cured her.
KITTY
Oh, Annie, I hope that's true. I really want to believe in miracles—I want a miracle for her.
ANNIE
Jesus, Lil!
LIL
I'm an Amazon! I can lift bull elephants above my head. I can slay dragons to win my lady's hand. fANNIE starts to help her.) Don't, Annie, you'll upset my balance. fANNIE stops. They all watch breathlessly as LIL successfully completes the steps and presents the cooler at EVA's feet.) Voila! (She takes a deep bow. To ANNIEJ See? (To KITTYJ Now get the hell off my back.
RITA
She's only trying to help you!
LIL
I don't need her help. (But at that moment the abdominal pain strikes and bends her double.)
ANNIE
Lil!
LIL
Don't touch me! I'm all right! I'm going to be all right! (It hits her again.) Eva! I'm going to be fine, Eva. It's nothing, really. I'm going to be just fine. (It hits again.)
KITTY
(To ANNIE J Help me get her up the stairs. (They move to do so.)
EVA
What's wrong? What's the matter with her? Lil?
KITTY
(To ANNIEJ You get her shoulders. (As they straighten her up, LIL cries with pain.)
ANNIE
Take it easy, pal, we got you.
EVA
What's wrong? What are you doing to her?
LIL
Eva!
KITTY
Sorry, Eva, out of the way.
EVA
Lil!
KITTY
(From bathroom.) Lil, listen to me.
LIL
(From bathroom.) You're wasting your breath, Kitty.
KITTY
(From bathroom.) Lil, you're stubborn as a mule.
LIL
(From bathroom.) Don't lecture me, Kitty.
KITTY
(From bathroom.) Put on your bathrobe. (Out door, to ANNIE J Where's her robe? (ANNIE hands it to KITTYJ
LIL
(From bathroom.) Go to hell.
KITTY
(In bathroom.) Put it on. You just got out of the hospital, for Christ's sake, Lil. You're going to lie down and rest if I have to tie you to the bed. (KITTY, irritated, exits bathroom. To ANN IE J Can't you talk some sense into her.
ANNIE
I'm her best friend, not her keeper.
KITTY
She wants to go fishing.
LIL
(From bathroom, hollers.) I feel fine!
ANNIE
(To KITTY about overnight bag.) I'm unpacking this.
KITTY
(Irritated.) I see you are.
ANNIE
She said to unpack it.
LIL
(Entering, wearing robe halfheartedly.) I'm not going back to the hospital, Kitty.
KITTY
You're self-destructive.
LIL
My lungs are fine. My lungs have always been fine. Pink and healthy as a baby's. fLIL reaches for a drink.) My liver's fine, too.
KITTY
Lie down, Lil. Please.
LIL
Stop trying to turn me into an invalid!
KITTY
Just walked out of the hospital. Walked out.
LIL
I'm an adult human being. I have a few civil rights left.
KITTY
Lil, you're not being reasonable.
LIL
Fuck reasonable! This is my body, my life. I'll decide what's going to happen to me.
ANNIE
Lil .. .
LIL
(To ANNIE J Don't you start on me. You're supposed to be on my side.
KITTY
There are no sides. You need surgery.
LIL
Sure. I need surgery this month and I'll need it again next month and again in two months—you know the statistics, Kitty.
KITTY
It will prolong your life, Lil.
LIL
In a hospital bed? No thanks.
ANNIE
You could let them try the cobalt again. . . .
KITTY
You responded very well to chemotherapy last spring.
LIL
For six weeks I was nauseated all day, my hair started falling out, I broke out in blotches, I was so weak I could hardly get from one room to another—Annie and Rae were waiting on me day and night. . . .
ANNIE
We didn't mind!
LIL
I mind!
KITTY
But the treatments helped. You felt wonderful until last week on the beach. . . .
LIL
And I feel fine again now. Without operations, without treatments, I feel fine.
KITTY
Bullshit, Lil.
LIL
They've already got my ovaries, uterus, tubes—if I'm going, I'm going with my hair, guts, breasts, whatever I've got left. I'm going as a person, not a patient. I'm going wanting to live, not wishing I were dead.
KITTY
You are stubborn and bullheaded—and you won't let anybody help you! There's a part of you I've never reached, Lil. You always close the door!
LIL
(Lightly.) You and I were terrible together, Kitty. Just terrible. We competed with each other all the time. Our relation-
KITTY
(To ANNIE J She thought I was a coward when I stopped practicing medicine.
LIL
(Lying, glances at ANNIEJ No, I didn't.
ANNIE
(Backing her up.) She didn't.
KITTY
(To both of them.) I know.
LIL
Well, my mother always wanted me to marry a doctor.
ANNIE
And she thought you looked sexy in that white coat. I could never see it myself.
KITTY
Those two years with you, Lil, they were special.
LIL
Well, try to remember the good parts, will you?
KITTY
I don't ever want to forget beating on that door of that motel room. Every time I take myself seriously, I want to think of that. I must have looked like twelve kinds of a jackass.
LIL
You did. (To ANNIEJ She did. (They laugh together.)
KITTY
(Through the laughter, to ANNIEJ Don't let me forget that.
ANNIE
Count on it.
LIL
(Quietly.) How much time do I have left, Kitty? (KITTY can't answer. ANNIE turns away suddenly, about to cry. LIL puts her hand on ANNIE's shoulder. To ANNIE J Don't you go soft on me. I need you now.
ANNIE
(Holding herself together.) I'm here. I'm right here. (LIL keeps her hand on ANN IE as though for support.)
LIL
Answer me, Kitty.
KITTY
What are you asking me, Lil? How long on your feet and pain-free?
LIL
Yes. I have to know. I have to plan.
KITTY
Lil, there's new growth. It could accelerate—or you could go into remission again.
LIL
Is that likely?
KITTY
It happens sometimes.
LIL
The worst that could happen, Kitty. The bottom line.
KITTY
Don't put me in this position, Lil.
LIL
Six months?
ANNIE
Answer her, Kitty.
KITTY
Less.
LIL
Three?
KITTY
(Hedging.) Maybe.
LI L
Six weeks of feeling good?
KITTY
At least.
LIL
(She'd expected more time—she is stunned.) Why is this happening to me, Kitty? Why isn't it happening to you or Annie or Rita or Rae? Why not Donna, why not Sue? Are you all so much worthier than I am? I'm in love—for the first time in my life, I feel totally alive. Damn you! fKITTY is helpless.)
ANNIE
(To KITTYJ Do something. Help her. (But KITTY can't.)
LIL
(Seeing KITTY 'shelplessness.) It's all right.
ANNIE
(Angry.) It's not all right!
LIL
I'm going to fish with you, my friend, out on that rock—we're going to smoke the best stuff we can buy—and every day, the first one to catch two blues buys lunch and drinks at Molly Pitcher's.
ANNIE
(Trying to be light.) I'm not much good at fishing.
LIL
I'll teach you all my tricks. (To KITTYJ And you, you never beat me in a game of poker yet.
KITTY
(Trying to be light.) That's because you cheat.
LIL
Me? The Girl Scout? Cheat? Eight o'clock tonight-I'm going to teach you how to fake. Quarters.
KITTY
Pennies.
LIL
Quarters, Kitty. Tightwad. Geez. (To ANNIEJ I'm offering her trade secrets and she's hassling me over quarters. Now I ask you, is that gratitude?
RAE
Don't slosh that. It's hot.
RITA
Her hands are shaking. (She takes container from EVA. To RAE J Smells delicious.
RAE
Actually, it's very bland. Kitty said to make something easy on her stomach. They've got her on a lot of medication. Don't let her load it with salt.
EVA
(Uncomfortably close to the stairs.) I wish someone had told me. . . . fRAE touches EVAsupportive/y.)
RITA
Would it have made a difference?
EVA
I don't know. It might have. (She takes bowl from RITA and steps onto the stairs, calls.) Li I! (The group onstage responds immediately.)
ANNIE
(To LILJ Hey, it's Eva.
KITTY
(Admitting EVA, RAE and RITA J It took you that long to open a can of chicken noodle?
RAE
I made it from scratch! Only the best for Lil.
KITTY
She could have starved while we were waiting.
EVA
Soup. Rae made it for you. (EVAputs it on counter.)
LIL
Fuck Rae's soup. (She opens her arms and EVA goes into them. They cling to one another.)
RAE
(In response to LIL's line.) Gee, thanks.
RITA
Welcome home.
RAE
Ditto.
ANN IE
(Having stuck her finger in the soup.) This needs salt.
KITTY
She shouldn't have salt.
ANNIE
It's too bland, honey, has no taste.
RAE
Anybody get the feeling we're not wanted?
ANNIE
Stay away from that soup, it's terrible.
KITTY
If you need me, Lil, I'll be on the beach.
RITA
(Calls.) She'll be in the cabin. (To KITTY J You're going to bed. You've been at that hospital day and night.
KITTY
(Stubbornly.) I'll be on the beach, Lil.
RITA
(Lovingly.) Kitty, we haven't been alone together for a week. . . .
KITTY
(Getting the picture.) I'll be in the cabin, Lil.
ANNIE
(As they exit, to RAEJ Why don't we go to Molly Pitcher's and have lunch with Sue and Donna?
RAE
Because there's a pot of soup this big on the stove.
ANNIE
I was afraid of that.
LIL
(Holding EVA apart and looking at her.) Well, I'm back. Fit as a fiddle.
EVA
You're going to be just fine.
LIL
Oh, yeah, I always said I could lick this thing.
EVA
(Uncomfortable.) Don't let the soup get cold.
LIL
(Aware of EVA's discomfort.) You didn't know you were getting damaged merchandise, did you? I'm sorry, Eva.
EVA
Stop that.
LIL
It changes everything.
EVA
No, it doesn't. (But it does.) Soon as you get to feeling better, we'll go to Europe just like we planned.
LIL
Sure.
EVA
We'll go to Switzerland—we don't have to ski.
LIL
I couldn't tell you.
EVA
I know. (Pause.) We can still ride the chairlift up the Alps.
LIL
I just couldn't tell you.
EVA
Tiny villages sparkling in the snow. . . .
LIL
(Sharply.) There's no snow in Switzerland this time of year.
EVA
(Forging ahead.) We'll go to Amsterdam then. Maybe Rae and Annie will come with us. Somebody has to give me away.
LIL
Nobody can give you away, Eva. You don't belong to anybody but yourself.
EVA
You're upset. You're not feeling well.
LI L
I feel fine. Alley cats recover very quickly.
EVA
We'll travel for a while, then maybe rent a cottage in New England this fall— we can go to the movies and read books together—I can read your favorite books to you—
LIL
Do yourself a favor, Eva. Leave me.
EVA
You don't mean that.
LIL
I do. I bet I've had a hundred women in my life—what makes you think I'd want to spend the rest of my life with you? And your memories of George and your goddam furniture and your uptight mother?
EVA
Li I, don't.
LIL
I want to do some living before I die. (She goes to door.) Hey, anybody down there? Where's Donna? I want to see Donna! (She turns to EVA coldly.) Get out of here, Eva. Get out of my life. (EMA doesn't budge.)
EVA
That's always worked for you, hasn't it? One act of bravado and you're off the hook. You have to catch the biggest fish, take every card game, seduce all the women you encounter—as long as you're winning, Li I, you're just fine. But when things get difficult, you leap out the motel window. We love each other, Lil. That's a commitment.
LIL
(Quietly.) Next summer, someone else will be standing at this window watching a July sunset—and Rae and Annie will be sitting over there, sipping drinks, and they'll say to this stranger at the window—"Beautiful sunset, huh? Lil loved that view. She thought God put that rock down there for her. When she stood on it with the surf pounding against it, spraying salt so high that she could taste it on her lips, she was Queen of Bluefish Cove." —I can't say goodbye to that beach out there, Eva. I can't say goodbye to Annie or to Kitty. How can I say goodbye to you? (L\L goes to EVA, lets EVA hold her. EVA is now the strong one.)
RITA
The wind's so strong. I had no idea it got so cold along the beach.
KITTY
Well, we've never had the occasion to be out here in late fall.
RITA
Pull that scarf around your neck, darling, I don't want you to catch cold. You start the promotion tour for your new book next week and it would be disastrous if you developed laryngitis.
KITTY
What would you think if I were to open up my office again. .. .
RITA
You mean go back to practicing?
KITTY
Lil always felt that I was copping out.
RAE
(Glancing at her watch.) I guess it's over now in Michigan. The service was at one o'clock.
RITA
I don't understand how they could take her. She wanted to be buried here.
KITTY
They're her family, honey. They have the legal right.
RITA
Her mother and father had disowned her.
KITTY
Well, they did fly here and stay by her at the end.
RITA
Stay by her? They guarded her from us.
SUE
I don't know what to do with all this stuff. Toothpaste, aspirin, bubblebath —
EVA
I promised Marge Eaton we'd clear this place out. Just put it over there, Sue.
KITTY
Lil asked me to give these clothes to the women's center. Some of them are pretty raggedy.
RITA
You can't give that workshirt to anybody. It's torn in half a dozen places.
KITTY
Well, throw it away then.
EVA
No. (She takes it.) I'd like to have that.
RITA
We could store these toiletries in our cabin for the winter —it's a shame to throw it all away.
SUE
What about this tackle box?
EVA
She wanted Annie to have that.
RITA
I'll take it down to her. (Shegoes downstairs.)
EVA
I wonder who'll have this place next summer?
KITTY
How about you, Eva?
EVA
I don't think so, Kitty. I couldn't afford it, anyway.
KITTY
You can always visit us.
EVA
I hope I'll be working next summer. I finish that office management course in January, thanks to Sue.
KITTY
If I open my practice again, I'll need an office manager.
EVA
(Gratefully.) Thanks. I've filled out applications for several big corporations with offices in Europe. I'd really like to travel. (Smiles.) Have some adventures.
KITTY
She loved you very much.
EVA
(Pulling herself together.) I know.
KITTY
(Changing the subject.) I expected to see Donna here today.
SUE
I don't think she knows, Kitty. I don't know where to contact her.
KITTY
That was the healthiest thing you ever did, Sue.
SUE
If you say so.
EVA
(Looking around.) Well, I think that's it. We can start carrying it down.
SUE
(Calls.) Hey, Rae, Rita, let's go.
RAE
What is that, honey?
ANNIE
It's her favorite lure. She always used it for the blue-fish. (Puts lure in tackle box.) Next year, we're going to build a barbeque pit down here. It'll be our summer project.
RAE
My summer project is going to be to lie in the sun with my feet up.
KITTY
I don't know how much time I'll be able to spend out here next year—if I open up my practice, I'll have office hours weekdays—
RITA
I think I'll hate it when you're on call, you'll be tired all the time.
SUE
I wouldn't miss a summer at Bluefish Cove for anything— it somehow puts my whole year in perspective.
RAE
You coming, Eva?
EVA
(Loweringblinds.) Yes, I'm coming.
ANNIE
You need a hand?
EVA
No thanks, Annie. I can make it by myself.
