Come one and all for England!
And everything she is she owes to me.
===
You’d hardly notice that the fellow’s black.
===
To teach him to grow up to be a man.
===
All go except BETTY. CLIVE comes.
Clive?
I thought you would never come. The day’s so long without you.
Long ride in the bush.
Is anything wrong? I heard drums.
Nothing serious. Beauty is a damned good mare. I must get some new boots sent from home. These ones have never been right. I have a blister.
My poor dear foot.
It’s nothing.
Oh but it’s sore.
We are not in this country to enjoy ourselves. Must have ridden fifty miles. Spoke to three different headmen who would all gladly chop off each other’s heads and wear them round their waists.
Clive!
And what has my little dove done today?
I’ve read a little.
Good. Is it good?
It’s poetry.
You’re so delicate and sensitive.
And I played the piano. Shall I send for the children?
Yes, in a minute. I’ve a piece of news for you.
Good news?
You’ll certainly think it’s good. A visitor.
From home?
No. Well of course originally from home.
Man or woman?
Man.
I can’t imagine.
Something of an explorer. Bit of a poet. Odd chap but brave as a lion. And a great admirer of yours.
What do you mean? Whoever can it be?
With an H and a B. And does conjuring tricks for little Edward.
That sounds like Mr Bagley.
Harry Bagley.
He certainly doesn’t admire me, Clive, what a thing to say. How could I possibly guess from that. He’s hardly explored anything at all, he’s just been up a river, he’s done nothing at all compared to what you do. You should have said a heavy drinker and a bit of a bore.
But you like him well enough. You don’t mind him coming?
Anyone at all to break the monotony.
But you have your mother. You have Ellen.
Ellen is a governess. My mother is my mother.
I hoped when she came to visit she would be company for you.
I don’t think mother is on a visit. I think she lives with us.
I think she does.
Clive you are so good.
But are you bored my love?
It’s just that I miss you when you’re away. We’re not in this country to enjoy ourselves. If I lack society that is my form of service.
That’s a brave girl. So today has been, all right? No fainting? No hysteria?
I have been very tranquil.
Ah what a haven of peace to come home to. The cool, the calm, the beauty.
There is one thing, Clive, if you don’t mind.
What can I do for you, my dear?
It’s about Joshua.
I wouldn’t leave you alone here with a quiet mind if it weren’t for Joshua.
Joshua doesn’t like me.
Joshua has been my boy for eight years. He has saved my life. I have saved his life. He is devoted to me and to mine. I have said this before.
He is rude to me. He doesn’t do what I say. Speak to him.
Tell me what happened.
He said something improper.
Well, what?
I don’t like to repeat it.
I must insist.
I had left my book inside on the piano. I was in the hammock. I asked him to fetch it.
And did he not fetch it?
Yes, he did eventually.
And what did he say?
Clive –
Betty.
He said Fetch it yourself. You’ve got legs under that dress.
===
Joshua, madam says you spoke impolitely to her this afternoon.
Sir?
When she asked you to pass her book from the piano.
===
She has the book, sir.
I have the book now, but when I told you –
===
Betty, please, let me handle this. You didn’t pass it at once?
No sir, I made a joke first.
What was that?
===
I said my legs were tired, sir. That was funny because the book was very near, it would not make my legs tired to get it.
That’s not true.
===
Did madam hear me wrong?
She heard something else.
===
What was that, madam?
Never mind.
===
Now Joshua, it won’t do you know. Madam doesn’t like that kind of joke. You must do what madam says, just do what she says and don’t answer back. You know your place, Joshua. I don’t have to say any more.
No sir.
I expect an apology.
===
I apologise, madam.
===
I think another drink, and send for the children, and isn’t that Harry riding down the hill? Wave, wave. Just in time before dark. Cuts it fine, the blighter. Always a hothead, Harry.
Can he see us?
Stand further forward. He’ll see your white dress. There, he waved back.
Do you think so? I wonder what he saw. Sometimes sunset is so terrifying I can’t bear to look.
It makes me proud. Elsewhere in the empire the sun is rising.
===
Shall I bring the children?
===
Shall Ellen bring the children?
Delightful.
Yes, Ellen, make sure they’re warm. The night air is deceptive. Victoria was looking pale yesterday.
===
Are you warm enough Betty?
Perfectly.
The night air is deceptive.
I’m quite warm. I’m too warm.
===
You’re not getting a fever, I hope? She’s not strong, you know, Clive. I don’t know how long you’ll keep her in this climate.
There’s my sweet little Vicky. What have we done today?
She wore Ellen’s hat.
Did she wear Ellen’s big hat like a lady. What a pretty.
===
And Joshua gave her a piggy back. Tell Papa. Horsey with Joshy?
She’s tired.
===
Nice Joshy played horsey. What a big strong Joshy. Did you have a gallop? Did you make him stop and go? Not very chatty tonight are we?
Edward, say good evening to papa.
===
Edward my boy. Have you done your lessons well?
Yes papa.
Did you go riding?
Yes papa.
===
What’s that you’re holding?
It’s Victoria’s doll. What are you doing with it, Edward?
Minding her.
===
Well I should give it to Ellen quickly. You don’t want papa to see you with a doll.
No, we had you with Victoria’s doll once before, Edward.
===
He’s minding it for Vicky. He’s not playing with it.
He’s not playing with it, Clive. He’s minding it for Vicky.
===
Ellen minds Victoria, let Ellen mind the doll.
===
Don’t pull her about. Vicky’s very fond of her. She likes me to have her.
He’s a very good brother.
===
Yes, it’s manly of you Edward, to take care of your little sister. We’ll say no more about it. Tomorrow I’ll take you riding with me and Harry Bagley. Would you like that?
Is he here?
===
Can I come, papa?
Is he warm enough?
===
Am I warm enough?
They go. The women are left. There is a silence.
===
I daresay Mr Bagley will be out all day and we’ll see nothing of him.
He plays the piano. Surely he will sometimes stay at home with us.
We can’t expect it. The men have their duties and we have ours.
===
He won’t have seen a piano for a year. He lives a very rough life.
Will it be exciting for you, Betty?
Whatever do you mean, Ellen?
===
We don’t have very much society.
Clive is my society.
===
It’s time Victoria went to bed.
She’d like to stay up and see Mr Bagley.
===
You let that girl forget her place, Betty.
Mother, she is governess to my son. I know what her place is. I think my friendship does her good. She is not very happy.
Young women are never happy.
Mother, what a thing to say.
Then when they’re older they look back and see that comparatively speaking they were ecstatic.
I’m perfectly happy.
You are looking very pretty tonight. You were such a success as a young girl. You have made a most fortunate marriage. I’m sure you will be an excellent hostess to Mr Bagley.
I feel quite nervous at the thought of entertaining.
I can always advise you if I’m asked.
What a long time they’re taking. I always seem to be waiting for the men.
===
I knew it. I heard drums. We’ll be killed in our beds.
Now, please, calm yourself.
I am perfectly calm. I am just outspoken. If it comes to being killed I shall take it as calmly as anyone.
There is no cause for alarm. Mrs Saunders has been alone since her husband died last year, amazing spirit. Not surprisingly, the strain has told. She has come to us as her nearest neighbours.
What happened to make her come?
This is not an easy country for a woman.
Clive, I heard drums. We are not children.
===
Of course you heard drums. The tribes are constantly at war, if the term is not too grand to grace their squabbles. Not unnaturally Mrs Saunders would like the company of white women. The piano. Poetry.
We are not her nearest neighbours.
===
We are among her nearest neighbours and I was a dear friend of her late husband. She knows that she will find a welcome here. She will not be disappointed. She will be cared for.
Of course we will care for her.
===
Victoria is in bed. I must go and say goodnight. Mother, please, you look after Mrs Saunders.
How rash to go out after dark without a shawl.
Where am I?
Clive? Clive? Thank God. This is very kind. How do you do? I am sorry to be a nuisance. Charmed. Have you a gun? I have a gun.
===
Ah, here is Mr Bagley.
I gave his horse some water.
===
You don’t know Mrs Saunders, do you Harry? She has at present collapsed, but she is recovering thanks to the good offices of my wife’s mother who I think you’ve met before. Betty will be along in a minute. Edward will go home to school shortly. He is quite a young man since you saw him.
I hardly knew him.
===
What news have you for us, Mr Bagley?
Do you know Mrs Saunders, Harry? Amazing spirit.
===
Did you hardly know me?
Of course I knew you. I mean you have grown.
What do you expect?
===
That’s quite right, people don’t get smaller.
Edward. You should be in bed.
===
No, I’m not tired, I’m not tired am I Uncle Harry?
I don’t think he’s tired.
===
He is overtired. It is past his bedtime. Say goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.
And to your grandmother.
===
Shall I help Mrs Saunders indoors? I’m afraid she may get a chill.
Shall I give her an arm?
===
Not a word to alarm the women.
Absolutely.
I did some good today I think. Kept up some alliances. There’s a lot of affection there.
They’re affectionate people. They can be very cruel of course.
Well they are savages.
Very beautiful people many of them.
Joshua! (To HARRY.) I think we should sleep with guns.
===
Joshua, you will have gathered there’s a spot of bother. Rumours of this and that. You should be armed I think.
There are many bad men, sir. I pray about it. Jesus will protect us.
===
I wondered where you were.
I was singing lullabies.
When I think of you I always think of you with Edward in your lap.
Do you think of me sometimes then?
You have been thought of where no white woman has ever been thought of before.
It’s one way of having adventures. I suppose I will never go in person.
That’s up to you.
Of course it’s not. I have duties.
Are you happy, Betty?
Where have you been?
Built a raft and went up the river. Stayed with some people. The king is always very good to me. They have a lot of skulls around the place but not white men’s I think. I made up a poem one night. If I should die in this forsaken spot, There is a loving heart without a blot, Where I will live – and so on.
When I’m near you it’s like going out into the jungle. It’s like going up the river on a raft. It’s like going out in the dark.
And you are safety and light and peace and home.
But I want to be dangerous.
Clive is my friend.
I am your friend.
I don’t like dangerous women.
Is Mrs Saunders dangerous?
Am I dangerous?
You are rather.
Please like me.
I worship you.
Please want me.
I don’t want to want you. Of course I want you.
What are we going to do?
===
He goes to take her in his arms, she runs away into the house. HARRY stays where he is. He becomes aware of JOSHUA.
Who’s there?
Only me sir.
Got a gun now have you?
Yes sir.
Where’s Clive?
Going round the boundaries sir.
Have you checked there’s nobody in the barns?
Yes sir.
Shall we go in a barn and fuck? It’s not an order.
===
An open space some distance from the house. MRS SAUNDERS alone, breathless. She is carrying a riding crop. CLIVE arrives.
Don’t fuss, Clive, it makes you sweat.
I didn’t want you to come after me. I wanted to be alone.
I just wanted to get out of your house.
Can I tell you something, Clive?
I don’t think that’s physically possible.
Clive, when I came to your house the other night I came because I was afraid. The cook was going to let his whole tribe in through the window.
I came to you although you are not my nearest neighbour –
Because the last time he came to visit me I had to defend myself with a shotgun and I thought you would take no for an answer.
I answered yes once. Sometimes I want to say no.
I think I will have to go back to my own house.
I didn’t.
What about me? Wait.
Don’t go now.
===
I never would have thought a guinea fowl could taste so like a turkey.
I had to explain to Cook three times.
===
This tablecloth was one of my mama’s.
===
Uncle Harry playing horsey.
Crackers crackers.
===
Not yet, Edward.
Oh dear, stained my trousers, never mind.
===
Can I have some?
Oh no Edward, not for you.
Give him half a glass.
If your father says so.
===
All rise please. To Her Majesty Queen Victoria, God bless her, and her husband and all her dear children.
The Queen.
===
General cracker pulling, hats. CLIVE and HARRY discuss champagne.
Excellent, Clive, wherever did you get it?
===
I know a chap in French Equatorial Africa.
Mama, don’t play. You know you can’t catch a ball.
===
Butterfingers.
===
I’m not.
Throw straight now.
===
I did, I did.
Keep your eye on the ball.
You can’t throw.
Don’t be a baby.
I’m not, throw a hard one, throw a hard one –
Butterfingers. What will Uncle Harry think of you?
He throws the ball wildly in the direction of JOSHUA.
Now you’ve lost the ball. He’s lost the ball.
It’s Joshua’s fault. Joshua’s butterfingers.
I don’t think I want to play any more. Joshua, find the ball will you?
Yes, please play. I’ll find the ball. Please play.
===
You’re so silly and you can’t catch. You’ll be no good at cricket.
Why don’t we play hide-and-seek?
===
Because it’s a baby game.
You’ve hurt Edward’s feelings.
===
A boy has no business having feelings.
Hide-and-seek. I’ll be it. Everybody must hide. This is the base, you have to get home to base.
Hide-and-seek, hide-and-seek.
===
Can we persuade the ladies to join us?
I’m playing. I love games.
===
I always get found straight away.
Come on, Betty, do. Vicky wants to play.
===
They all go except CLIVE, HARRY, JOSHUA.
It is safe, I suppose?
They won’t go far. This is very much my territory and it’s broad daylight. Joshua will keep an open eye.
Well I must give them a hundred. You don’t know what this means to me, Clive. A chap can only go on so long alone. I can climb mountains and go down rivers, but what’s it for? For Christmas and England and games and women singing. This is the empire, Clive. It’s not me putting a flag in new lands. It’s you. The empire is one big family. I’m one of its black sheep, Clive. And I know you think my life is rather dashing. But I want you to know I admire you. This is the empire, Clive, and I serve it. With all my heart.
I think that’s about a hundred.
He goes.
===
Harry Bagley is a fine man, Joshua. You should be proud to know him. He will be in history books.
Sir, while we are alone.
Joshua of course, what is it? You always have my ear. Any time.
Sir, I have some information. The stable boys are not to be trusted. They whisper. They go out at night. They visit their people. Their people are not my people. I do not visit my people.
Thank you, Joshua. They certainly look after Beauty. I’ll be sorry to have to replace them.
They carry knives.
Thank you, Joshua.
And, sir.
I appreciate this, Joshua, very much.
Your wife.
Ah, yes?
She also thinks Harry Bagley is a fine man.
Thank you, Joshua.
Are you going to hide?
Yes, yes I am. Thank you. Keep your eyes open Joshua.
===
I can’t run, I can’t run at all.
There, I’ve caught you.
Harry, what are we going to do?
It’s impossible, Betty.
===
I give up. Don’t catch me. I have been stung.
Nothing serious I hope.
===
I won, I won, you didn’t catch me.
Yes I did.
===
Mama, who was first?
I wasn’t watching. I think it was Harry.
===
It wasn’t Harry. You’re no good at judging. I won, didn’t I Grandma?
I expect so, since it’s Christmas.
===
I won, Uncle Harry. I’m better than you.
Why don’t you help Uncle Harry look for the others?
===
Shall I?
Yes, of course.
Harry, I shall scream.
===
Why don’t you go back to the house, Mother, and rest your insect bite?
Betty, my duty is here. I don’t like what I see. Clive wouldn’t like it, Betty. I am your mother.
===
I can’t find anyone else. I’m getting quite hot.
Sit down a minute.
===
I can’t do that. I’m he. How’s your sting?
It seems to be swelling up.
===
Why don’t you go home and rest? Joshua will go with you. Joshua!
I could take you back. MAUD That would be charming.
===
Joshua, my mother wants to go back to the house. Will you go with her please.
Sir told me I have to keep an eye.
===
I am telling you to go back to the house. Then you can come back here and keep an eye.
===
Don’t give way. Keep calm.
I shall kill myself.
Betty, you are a star in my sky. Without you I would have no sense of direction. I need you, and I need you where you are, I need you to be Clive’s wife. I need to go up rivers and know you are sitting here thinking of me.
I want more than that. Is that wicked of me?
===
Uncle Harry, where are you?
===
Can’t we ever be alone?
You are a mother. And a daughter. And a wife.
===
Uncle Harry!
There you are. I haven’t found anyone have you?
I wonder where they all are.
Perhaps they’re lost for ever. Perhaps they’re dead. There’s trouble going on isn’t there, and nobody says because of not frightening the women and children.
Yes, that’s right.
Do you think we’ll be killed in our beds?
Not very likely.
I can’t sleep at night. Can you?
I’m not used to sleeping in a house.
If I’m awake at night can I come and see you? I won’t wake you up. I’ll only come in if you’re awake.
You should try to sleep.
I don’t mind being awake because I make up adventures. Once we were on a raft going down to the rapids. We’ve lost the paddles because we used them to fight off the crocodiles. A crocodile comes at me and I stab it again and again and the blood is everywhere and it tips up the raft and it has you by the leg and it’s biting your leg right off and I take my knife and stab it in the throat and rip open its stomach and it lets go of you but it bites my hand but it’s dead. And I drag you onto the river bank and I’m almost fainting with pain and we lie there in each other’s arms.
Have I lost my leg?
I forgot about the leg by then.
Hadn’t we better look for the others?
You don’t have to wear it either but you might like it to look at.
It’s beautiful. But you’ll have to put it back.
I wanted to give it to you.
You did. It can go back in the box. You still gave it to me. Come on now, we have to find the others.
Harry, I love you.
Yes I know. I love you too.
You know what we did when you were here before. I want to do it again. I think about it all the time. I try to do it to myself but it’s not as good. Don’t you want to any more?
I do, but it’s a sin and a crime and it’s also wrong.
But we’ll do it anyway won’t we?
Yes of course.
I wish the others would all be killed. Take it out now and let me see it.
No.
Is it big now?
Yes.
Let me touch it.
No.
Just hold me.
When you can’t sleep.
We’d better find the others then. Come on.
===
They go out with whoops and shouts. BETTY and ELLEN come.
Ellen, I don’t want to play any more.
Nor do I, Betty.
Come and sit here with me. Oh Ellen, what will become of me?
Betty, are you crying? Are you laughing?
Tell me what you think of Harry Bagley.
He’s a very fine man.
No, Ellen, what you really think.
I think you think he’s very handsome.
And don’t you think he is? Oh Ellen, you’re so good and I’m so wicked.
===
I’ve found you.
We’re not hiding Edward.
But I found you.
We’re not playing, Edward, now run along.
Come on, Ellen, do play. Come on, Mama.
===
Edward, don’t pull your mama like that.
Edward, you must do what your governess says. Go and play with Uncle Harry.
===
Ellen, can you keep a secret?
Oh yes, yes please.
I love Harry Bagley. I want to go away with him. There, I’ve said it, it’s true.
How do you know you love him?
I kissed him.
Betty.
He held my hand like this. Oh I want him to do it again. I want him to stroke my hair.
Your lovely hair. Like this, Betty?
I want him to put his arm around my waist.
Like this, Betty?
Yes, oh I want him to kiss me again.
Ellen, whatever are you doing? It’s not a joke.
I’m sorry, Betty. You’re so pretty. Harry Bagley doesn’t deserve you. You wouldn’t really go away with him?
Oh Ellen, you don’t know what I suffer. You don’t know what love is. Everyone will hate me, but it’s worth it for Harry’s love.
I don’t hate you, Betty, I love you.
Harry says we shouldn’t go away. But he says he worships me.
I worship you Betty.
===
They embrace. The others have all gathered together. MAUD has rejoined the party, and JOSHUA.
===
I didn’t want to spoil the fun by not being here.
===
I think we should have some singing now. Ladies, I rely on you to lead the way.
We have a surprise for you. I have taught Joshua a Christmas carol. He has been singing it at the piano but I’m sure he can sing it unaccompanied, can’t you, Joshua?
===
Inside the house. BETTY, MRS SAUNDERS, MAUD with VICTORIA. The blinds are down so the light isn’t bright though it is day outside. CLIVE looks in.
===
Who actually does the flogging?
I imagine Joshua.
Well we can ask them afterwards.
===
How should I speak of it?
Harry Bagley says they should just be sent away. I don’t think he likes to see them beaten.
Harry is so tender-hearted. perhaps he is right.
And what will they say about us in the village if they’ve been flogged?
===
That is never wise.
Whatever shall we do?
I know a little of what is going on.
Tell me what you know. Clive tells me nothing.
You would not want to be told about it, Betty. It is enough for you that Clive knows what is happening. Clive will know what to do. Your father always knew what to do.
I would do what I did at my own home. I left. I can’t see any way out except to leave. I will leave here. I will keep leaving everywhere I suppose.
Luckily this household has a head. I am squeamish myself. But luckily Clive is not.
===
Shouldn’t you be with the men, Edward?
===
Will she go and look?
===
Edward, what have you got there?
I’m minding her.
===
Edward, I’ve told you before, dolls are for girls.
Where is Ellen? She should be looking after Edward. (She goes to the door.) Ellen! Betty, why do you let that girl mope about in her own room? That’s not what she’s come to Africa for.
===
You must never let the boys at school know you like dolls. Never, never. No one will talk to you, you won’t be on the cricket team, you won’t grow up to be a man like your papa.
I don’t want to be like papa. I hate Papa.
===
Edward! Edward!
You’re a horrid wicked boy and papa will beat you. Of course you don’t hate him, you love him. Now give Victoria her doll at once.
===
She’s not Victoria’s doll, she’s my doll. She doesn’t love Victoria and Victoria doesn’t love her. Victoria never even plays with her.
Victoria will learn to play with her.
===
Ellen, look what you’ve done. Edward’s got the doll again. Now, Ellen, will you please do your job.
===
===
Joshua?
Madam?
Did you want something?
===
We’re very well thank you, Joshua, and how are you?
And the stable boys?
===
So I saw. And does your arm ache?
You don’t mind beating your own people?
===
A different tribe?
===
Papa, Papa, Ellen tried to lock me in the nursery. Mama is going to tell you of me. I’d rather tell you myself. I was playing with Vicky’s doll again and I know it’s very bad of me. And I said I didn’t want to be like you and I said I hated you. And it’s not true and I’m sorry, I’m sorry and please beat me and forgive me.
Well there’s a brave boy to own up. You should always respect and love me, Edward, not for myself, I may not deserve it, but as I respected and loved my own father, because he was my father. Through our father we love our Queen and our God, Edward. Do you understand? It is something men understand.
Yes papa.
Then I forgive you and shake you by the hand. You spend too much time with the women. You may spend more time with me and Uncle Harry, little man.
I don’t like women. I don’t like dolls papa, and I love you, Uncle Harry.
===
They all start to go. EDWARD takes HARRY ’s hand and goes with him. CLIVE draws BETTY back. They embrace.
Poor Clive.
It was my duty to have them flogged. For you and Edward and Victoria, to keep you safe.
It is terrible to feel betrayed.
You can tame a wild animal only so far. They revert to their true nature and savage your hand. Sometimes I feel the natives are the enemy. I know that is wrong. I know I have a responsibility towards them, to care for them and bring them all to be like Joshua. But there is something dangerous. Implacable. This whole continent is my enemy. I am pitching my whole mind and will and reason and spirit against it to tame it, and I sometimes feel it will break over me and swallow me up.
Clive, Clive, I am here. I have faith in you.
Yes, I can show you my moments of weakness, Betty, because you are my wife and because I trust you. I trust you, Betty, and it would break my heart if you did not deserve that trust. Harry Bagley is my friend. It would break my heart if he did not deserve my trust.
I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Forgive me. It is not Harry’s fault, it is all mine. Harry is noble. He has rejected me. It is my wickedness. I get bored, I get restless, I imagine things. There is something so wicked in me, Clive.
I have never thought of you having the weakness of your sex, only the good qualities.
I am bad, bad, bad –
You are thoughtless, Betty, that’s all. Women can be treacherous and evil. They are darker and more dangerous than men. The family protects us from that, you protect me from that. You are not that sort of woman. You are not unfaithful to me, Betty. I can’t believe you are. It would hurt me so much to cast you off. That would be my duty.
No, no, no.
Joshua has seen you kissing.
Forgive me.
But I don’t want to know about it. I don’t want to know. I wonder of course, I wonder constantly. If Harry Bagley was not my friend I would shoot him. If I shot you every British man and woman would applaud me. But no. It was a moment of passion such as women are too weak to resist. But you must resist it, Betty, or it will destroy us. We must fight against it. We must resist this dark female lust, Betty, or it will swallow us up.
I do, I do resist. Help me. Forgive me.
===
They go out arm in arm. As soon as they have gone EDWARD sneaks back to get the doll, which has been dropped on the floor. He picks it up and comforts it. JOSHUA comes through with a tray of drinks.
===
They embrace. JOSHUA comes in again, passing through.
Joshua, fetch me some blue thread from my sewing box. It is on the piano.
You’ve got legs under that skirt.
Joshua.
And more than legs.
===
Edward, are you going to stand there and let a servant insult your mother?
Joshua, get my mother’s thread.
Oh little Eddy, playing at master. It’s only a joke.
Don’t speak to my mother like that again.
Ladies have no sense of humour. You like a joke with Joshua.
You fetch her sewing at once, do you hear me? You move when I speak to you, boy.
===
She goes to embrace him but he moves away.
===
The verandah as in Scene One. Early morning. Nobody there. JOSHUA comes out of the house slowly and stands for some time doing nothing. EDWARD comes out.
Tell me another bad story, Joshua. Nobody else is even awake yet.
First there was nothing and then there was the great goddess. She was very large and she had golden eyes and she made the stars and the sun and the earth. But soon she was miserable and lonely and she cried like a great waterfall and her tears made all the rivers in the world. So the great spirit sent a terrible monster, a tree with hundreds of eyes and a long green tongue, and it came chasing after her and she jumped into a lake and the tree jumped in after her, and she jumped right up into the sky. And the tree couldn’t follow, he was stuck in the mud. So he picked up a big handful of mud and he threw it at her, up among the stars, and it hit her on the head. And she fell down onto the earth into his arms and the ball of mud is the moon in the sky. And then they had children which is all of us.
It’s not true, though.
===
Run along now, Edward. No, you may stay. You mustn’t repeat anything you hear to your mother or your grandmother or Ellen.
Or Mrs Saunders?
===
Mrs Saunders is an unusual woman and does not require protection in the same way. Harry, there was trouble last night where we expected it. But it’s all over now. Everything is under control but nobody should leave the house today I think.
Casualties?
No, none of the soldiers hurt thank God. We did a certain amount of damage, set a village on fire and so forth.
Was that necessary?
===
Obviously, it was necessary, Harry, or it wouldn’t have happened. The army will come and visit, no doubt. You’ll like that, eh, Joshua, to see the British army? And a treat for you, Edward, to see the soldiers. Would you like to be a soldier?
I’d rather be an explorer.
===
Harry, why won’t you talk to me?
Of course I’ll talk to you.
If you won’t be nice to me I’ll tell father.
Edward, no, not a word, never, not to your mother, nobody, please. Edward, do you understand? Please.
I won’t tell. I promise I’ll never tell. I’ve cut my finger and sworn.
There’s no need to get so excited Edward. We can’t be together all the time. I will have to leave soon anyway, and go back to the river.
===
You can’t, you can’t go. Take me with you.
Edward!
===
Edward, breakfast time. Edward.
I’m not hungry.
===
Why, what’s the matter?
He won’t come in for breakfast.
===
Edward, I shall call your father.
He goes in. BETTY is about to follow.
===
Betty, when Edward goes to school will I have to leave?
Never mind, Ellen dear, you’ll get another place. I’ll give you an excellent reference.
I don’t want another place, Betty. I want to stay with you for ever.
If you go back to England you might get married, Ellen. You’re quite pretty, you shouldn’t despair of getting a husband.
I don’t want a husband. I want you.
Children of your own, Ellen, think.
I don’t want children, I don’t like children. I just want to be alone with you, Betty, and sing for you and kiss you because I love you, Betty.
I love you too, Ellen. But women have their duty as soldiers have. You must be a mother if you can.
Betty, Betty, I love you so much. I want to stay with you for ever, my love for you is eternal, stronger than death. I’d rather die than leave you, Betty.
===
Clive, please forgive me.
===
Women, Harry. I envy you going into the jungle, a man’s life.
I envy you.
Harry, I know you do. I have spoken to Betty.
I assure you, Clive –
Please say nothing about it.
My friendship for you –
Absolutely. I know the friendship between us, Harry, is not something that could be spoiled by the weaker sex. Friendship between men is a fine thing. It is the noblest form of relationship.
I agree with you.
There is the necessity of reproduction. The family is all important. And there is the pleasure. But what we put ourselves through to get the pleasure, Harry. When I heard about our fine fellows last night fighting those savages to protect us I thought yes, that is what I aspire to. I tell you Harry, in confidence, I suddenly got out of Mrs Saunders’ bed and came out here on the verandah and looked at the stars.
I couldn’t sleep last night either.
There is something dark about women, that threatens what is best in us. Between men that light burns brightly.
I didn’t know you felt like that.
Women are irrational, demanding, inconsistent, treacherous, lustful, and they smell different from us.
Clive –
===
What are you doing?
Well, you said –
I said what?
I’m sorry, I misunderstood, I would never have dreamt, I thought –
My God, Harry, how disgusting.
You will not betray my confidence.
I feel contaminated.
I struggle against it. You cannot imagine the shame. I have tried everything to save myself.
The most revolting perversion. Rome fell, Harry, and this sin can destroy an empire.
It is not a sin, it is a disease.
A disease more dangerous than diphtheria. Effeminacy is contagious. How I have been deceived. Your face does not look degenerate. Oh Harry, how did you sink to this?
Clive, help me, what am I to do?
You have been away from England too long.
Where can I go except into the jungle to hide?
You don’t do it with the natives, Harry? My God, what a betrayal of the Queen.
Clive, I am like a man born crippled. Please help me.
You must repent.
I have thought of killing myself.
That is a sin too.
There is no way out. Clive, I beg of you, do not betray my confidence.
I cannot keep a secret like this. Rivers will be named after you, it’s unthinkable. You must save yourself from depravity. You must get married. You are not unattractive to women. What a relief that you and Betty were not after all – good God, how disgusting. Now Mrs Saunders. She’s a woman of spirit, she could go with you on your expeditions.
I suppose getting married wouldn’t be any worse than killing myself.
===
Why?
I choose to be alone, Mr Bagley. If I can look after myself, I’m sure you can. Clive, I have something important to tell you. I’ve just found Joshua putting earth on his head. He tells me his parents were killed last night by the British soldiers. I think you owe him an apology on behalf of the Queen.
===
===
Joshua, do you want a day off? Do you want to go to your people?
Not my people, sir.
But you want to go to your parents’ funeral?
No sir.
Yes, Joshua, yes, your father and mother. I’m sure they were loyal to the Crown. I’m sure it was all a terrible mistake.
My mother and father were bad people.
Joshua, no.
You are my father and mother.
===
What’s the matter? What’s happening?
===
Something terrible has happened. No, I mean some relatives of Joshua’s met with an accident.
May I go sir?
===
What? What?
Edward, go and do your lessons.
===
What is it, Uncle Harry?
Go and do your lessons.
===
Edward, come in here at once.
===
Go away. Go inside. Ellen!
Go inside, Edward. I shall tell your mother.
===
Go inside, Edward at once. I shall tell your father.
Mr Bagley has something to say to you.
===
Ellen. I don’t suppose you would marry me?
What if I said yes?
===
The governess and your wife, sir.
What’s that, Joshua?
She talks of love to your wife, sir. I have seen them. Bad women.
===
===
Betty, what happens with a man? I don’t know what to do.
You just keep still.
And what does he do?
Harry will know what to do.
And is it enjoyable?
Ellen, you’re not getting married to enjoy yourself.
===
I think my necklace has been stolen Clive. I did so want to wear it at the wedding.
It was Joshua. Joshua took it.
Joshua?
===
He did, he did, I saw him with it.
Edward, that’s not true.
It is, it is.
Edward, I’m afraid you took it yourself.
I did not.
===
I have seen him with it.
===
Edward, come back. Have you got my necklace?
I should leave him alone. He’ll bring it back.
I wanted to wear it. I wanted to look my best at your wedding.
You always look your best to me.
===
The sale of my property is completed. I shall leave tomorrow.
I shall go to England and buy a farm there. I shall introduce threshing machines.
===
Mrs Saunders, how can you abuse my hospitality? How dare you touch my wife? You must leave here at once.
Go away, go away. You are a wicked woman.
===
Mrs Saunders, I am shocked. This is your hostess.
===
No place for her anywhere I should think. Shocking behaviour.
Oh Clive, forgive me, and love me like you used to.
===
Were you jealous my dove? My own dear wife!
===
Good God, Edward, it’s true.
I was minding it for Mama because of the troubles.
===
Ah, here’s the bride. Come along, Ellen, you don’t cry at your own wedding, only at other people’s.
===
Now, speeches, speeches. Who is going to make a speech? Harry, make a speech.
I’m no speaker. You’re the one for that.
Speech, speech.
===
Applause.
===
What’s this?
Oh look.
===
Edward.
It was Joshua. It was Joshua. I saw him.
===
Scene One
Winter afternoon. Inside the hut of a one o’clock club, a children’s play centre in a park, VICTORIA and LIN, mothers. CATHY, LIN’s daughter, aged 4, played by a man, clinging to LIN. VICTORIA reading a book.
===
Yum yum bubblegum.
Like your shoes, Victoria.
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire.
Cathy, do stop. Do a painting.
You do a painting.
You do a painting.
What shall I paint?
Paint a house.
No.
Princess.
No.
Pirates.
Already done that.
Spacemen.
I never paint spacemen. You know I never.
Paint a car crash and blood everywhere.
No, don’t tell me. I know what to paint.
Go on then. You need an apron, where’s an apron. Here.
Don’t want an apron.
Lift up your arms. There’s a good girl.
I don’t want to paint.
Don’t paint. Don’t paint.
===
What shall I do? You paint. What shall I do Mum?
===
She goes on reading. She reads while she talks.
I don’t know how you can concentrate.
You have to or you never do anything.
Yeah well. It’s really warm in here, that’s one thing. It’s better than standing out there. I got chilblains last winter.
It is warm.
I suppose Tommy doesn’t let you read much. I expect he talks to you while you’re reading.
Yes, he does.
I didn’t get very far with that book you lent me.
That’s all right.
I was glad to have it, though. I sit with it on my lap while I’m watching telly. Well, Cathy’s off. She’s frightened I’m going to leave her. It’s the babyminder didn’t work out when she was two, she still remembers. You can’t get them used to other people if you’re by yourself. It’s no good blaming me. She clings round my knees every morning up the nursery and they don’t say anything but they make you feel you’re making her do it. But I’m desperate for her to go to school. I did cry when I left her the first day. You wouldn’t, you’re too fucking sensible. You’ll call the teacher by her first name. I really fancy you.
What?
Put your book down will you for five minutes. You didn’t hear a word I said.
I don’t get much time to myself.
Do you ever go to the movies?
Tommy’s very funny who he’s left with. My mother babysits sometimes.
Your husband could babysit.
But then we couldn’t go to the movies.
You could go to the movies with me.
Oh I see.
Couldn’t you?
Well yes, I could.
Friday night?
What film are we talking about?
Does it matter what film?
Of course it does.
Don’t hit him, Cathy, kill him. Point the gun, kiou, kiou, kiou. That’s the way.
They’ve just banned war toys in Sweden.
The kids’ll just hit each other more.
Well, psychologists do differ in their opinions as to whether or not aggression is innate.
Yeah?
I’m afraid I do let Tommy play with guns and just hope he’ll get it out of his system and not end up in the army.
I’ve got a brother in the army.
Oh I’m sorry. Whereabouts is he stationed?
Belfast.
Oh dear.
I’ve got a friend who’s Irish and we went on a Troops Out march. Now my dad won’t speak to me.
I don’t get on too well with my father either.
And your husband? How do you get on with him?
Oh, fine. Up and down. You know. Very well. He helps with the washing up and everything.
I left mine two years ago. He let me keep Cathy and I’m grateful for that.
You shouldn’t be grateful.
I’m a lesbian.
You still shouldn’t be grateful.
I’m grateful he didn’t hit me harder than he did.
I suppose I’m very lucky, with Martin.
Don’t get at me about how I bring up Cathy, OK?
I didn’t.
I hate men.
You have to look at it in a historical perspective in terms of learnt behaviour since the industrial revolution.
I just hate the bastards.
===
By now CATHY has come back in and started painting in many colours, without an apron. EDWARD comes in.
Victoria, mother’s in the park. She’s walking round all the paths very fast.
By herself.
I told her you were here.
Thanks.
Come on.
===
Shit, Cathy, what about an apron. I don’t mind you having paint on your frock but if it doesn’t wash off just don’t tell me you can’t wear a frock with paint on, OK?
OK.
===
You’re gay, aren’t you?
I beg your pardon?
I really fancy your sister. I thought you’d understand. You do but you can go on pretending you don’t, I don’t mind. That’s lovely Cathy, I like the green bit.
Don’t go around saying that. I might lose my job.
The last gardener was ever so straight. He used to flash at all the little girls.
I wish you hadn’t said that about me. It’s not true.
It’s not true and I never said it and I never thought it and I never will think it again.
Someone might have heard you.
===
It’s quite a nasty bump.
He’s not even crying.
I think that’s very worrying. You and Edward always cried. Perhaps he’s got concussion.
Of course he hasn’t Mummy.
That other little boy was very rough. Should you speak to somebody about him?
Tommy was hitting him with a spade.
Well he’s a real little boy. And so brave not to cry. You must watch him for signs of drowsiness. And nausea. If he’s sick in the night, phone an ambulance. Well, you’re looking very well darling, a bit tired, a bit peaky. I think the fresh air agrees with Edward. He likes the open-air life because of growing up in Africa. He misses the sunshine, don’t you, darling? We’ll soon have Edward back on his feet. What fun it is here.
This is Lin. And Cathy.
===
Oh Cathy what a lovely painting. What is it? Well I think it’s a house on fire. I think all that red is a fire. Is that right? Or do I see legs, is it a horse? Can I have the lovely painting or is it for Mummy? Children have such imagination, it makes them so exhausting. (To LIN.) I’m sure you’re wonderful, just like Victoria. I had help with my children. One does need help. That was in Africa of course so there wasn’t the servant problem. This is my son Edward. This is –
Lin.
Lin, this is Lin. Edward is doing something such fun, he’s working in the park as a gardener. He does look exactly like a gardener.
I am a gardener.
===
What you do that for silly? It was nice.
===
I like your earrings.
Did you say you’re leaving Daddy?
===
Do you darling? Shall I put them on you? My ears aren’t pierced, I never wanted that, they just clip on the lobe.
She’ll get paint on you, mind.
===
There’s a pretty girl. It doesn’t hurt does it? Well you’ll grow up to know you have to suffer a little bit for beauty.
Look mum I’m pretty, I’m pretty, I’m pretty.
===
Stop showing off Cathy.
It’s time we went home. Tommy, time to go home. Last go then, all right.
===
Mum did I hear you right just now?
I want my ears pierced.
Ooh, not till you’re big.
I know a girl got her ears pierced and she’s three. She’s got real gold.
===
I don’t expect she’s English, darling. Can I give her a sweetie? I know they’re not very good for the teeth, Vicky gets terribly cross with me. What does Mummy say?
Just one, thank you very much.
===
I like your beads.
It is the necklace from Act One.
===
Look at me, look at me. Vicky, Vicky look at me.
You look lovely, come on now.
And your hat, and your hat.
===
No, that’s enough.
Of course she can have my hat.
===
Yes, yes, hat, hat. Look look look.
That’s enough, please, stop it now. Hat off, bye-bye hat.
Give me my hat.
===
Bye-bye beads.
It’s just fun.
===
It’s very nice of you.
I want my beads.
Where’s the other earring?
===
Is it on the floor?
Don’t step on it.
===
Where?
I want my beads. I want my beads.
===
I want my beads.
Oh dear oh dear. Have you got the earring? Thank you darling.
I want my beads, you’re horrid, I hate you, Mum, you smell.
===
This is the point you see where one had help. Well it’s been lovely seeing you dears and I’ll be off again on my little walk.
You’re leaving him? Really?
===
Fucking hell.
Puking Jesus.
That was news was it, leaving your father?
===
They’re going to want so much attention.
Does everybody hate their mothers?
===
Mind you, I wouldn’t live with him.
Tommy, you’ve had two last goes. Last last last last go.
===
Not that funny, come on, coat on.
Can I have your painting?
What for?
For a friend of mine.
What’s his name?
Gerry.
How old is he?
Thirty-two.
===
Will you have sex with me?
I don’t know what Martin would say. Does it count as adultery with a woman?
===
Spring. Swing, bench, pond nearby. EDWARD is gardening. GERRY is sitting on a bench.
I sometimes pretend we don’t know each other. And you’ve come to the park to eat your sandwiches and look at me.
That would be more interesting, yes. Come and sit down.
If the superintendent comes I’ll be in trouble. It’s not my dinner time yet. Where were you last night? I think you owe me an explanation. We always do tell each other everything.
Is that a rule?
It’s what we agreed.
It’s a habit we’ve got into. Look, I was drunk. I woke up at four o’clock on somebody’s floor. I was sick. I hadn’t any money for a cab. I went back to sleep.
You could have phoned.
There wasn’t a phone.
Sorry.
There was a phone and I didn’t phone you. Leave it alone, Eddy, I’m warning you.
What are you going to do to me, then?
I’m going to the pub.
I’ll join you in ten minutes.
===
===
Tom!
He’ll fall in.
===
No he won’t.
Don’t go too near the edge, Tom. Throw the bread from there. The ducks can get it.
===
I’ll never be able to manage. If I can’t even walk down the street by myself. Everything looks so fierce.
Just watch Tommy feeding the ducks.
He’s going to fall in. Make Martin make him move back.
He’s not going to fall in.
It’s since I left your father.
Mummy, it really was the right decision.
Everything comes at me from all directions. Martin despises me.
Of course he doesn’t Mummy.
===
Of course he does.
Throw the bread. That’s the way. The duck can get it. Quack quack quack quack quack.
===
I don’t want to take pills. Lin says you can’t trust doctors.
You’re not taking pills. You’re doing very well.
But I’m so frightened.
What are you frightened of?
Victoria, you always ask that as if there was suddenly going to be an answer.
Are you all right sitting there?
===
===
I’ve bought her three new frocks. She won’t wear jeans to school any more because Tracy and Mandy called her a boy.
Tracy’s got a perm.
You should have shot them.
They’re coming to tea and we’ve got to have trifle. Not trifle you make, trifle out of a packet. And you’ve got to wear a skirt. And tights.
Tracy’s mum wears jeans.
===
She does not. She wears velvet.
Well I think you look very pretty. And if that gun has caps in it please take it a long way away.
===
It’s got red caps. They’re louder.
===
You’re dead Vicky.
Aaaargh.
Fall over.
I’m not falling over, the ground’s wet.
You’re dead.
Yes, I’m dead.
===
The Dead Hand Gang fall over. They said I had to fall over in the mud or I can’t play. That duck’s a mandarin.
Which one? Look, Tommy?
===
You must be very lonely yourself with no husband. You don’t miss him?
Not really, no.
Maybe you like being on your own.
I’m seeing quite a lot of Vicky. I don’t live alone. I live with Cathy.
I would have been frightened when I was your age. I thought, the poor children, their mother all alone.
I’ve a lot of friends.
I find when I’m making tea I put out two cups. It’s strange not having a man in the house. You don’t know who to do things for.
Yourself.
Oh, that’s very selfish.
Have you any women friends?
I’ve never been so short of men’s company that I’ve had to bother with women.
Don’t you like women?
They don’t have such interesting conversations as men. There has never been a woman composer of genius. They don’t have a sense of humour. They spoil things for themselves with their emotions. I can’t say I do like women very much, no.
But you’re a woman.
There’s nothing says you have to like yourself.
Do you like me?
===
Do you know if you put cocaine on your prick you can keep up it all night? The only thing is of course it goes numb so you don’t feel anything. But you would, that’s the main thing. I just want to make you happy.
===
Vicky, I’d like to go home.
Yes, Mummy, of course.
I’m sorry, dear.
===
I think Tommy would like to stay out a bit longer.
Hello, Martin. We do keep out of each other’s way.
===
I think that’s the best thing to do.
Perhaps you’d walk home with me, Martin. I do feel safer with a man. The park is so large the grass seems to tilt.
===
Why the hell can’t he just be a wife and come with me? Why does Martin make me tie myself in knots? No wonder we can’t just have a simple fuck. No, not Martin, why do I make myself tie myself in knots. It’s got to stop, Lin. I’m not like that with you. Would you love me if I went to Manchester?
Yes.
Would you love me if I went on a climbing expedition in the Andes mountains?
Yes.
Would you love me if my teeth fell out?
Yes.
Would you love me if I loved ten other people?
And me?
Yes.
Yes.
And I feel apologetic for not being quite so subordinate as I was. I am more intelligent than him. I am brilliant.
Leave him Vic. Come and live with me.
Don’t be silly.
Silly, Christ, don’t then. I’m not asking because I need to live with someone. I’d enjoy it, that’s all, we’d both enjoy it. Fuck you. Cathy, for fuck’s sake – stop throwing stones at the ducks. The man’s going to get you.
What man? Do you need a man to frighten your child with?
My mother said it.
You’re so inconsistent, Lin.
I’ve changed who I sleep with, I can’t change everything.
Like when I had to stop you getting a job in a boutique and collaborating with sexist consumerism.
I should have got that job, Cathy would have liked it. Why shouldn’t I have some decent clothes? I’m sick of dressing like a boy, why can’t I look sexy, wouldn’t you love me?
Lin, you’ve no analysis.
No but I’m good at kissing aren’t I? I give Cathy guns, my mum didn’t give me guns. I dress her in jeans, she wants to wear dresses. I don’t know. I can’t work it out. I don’t want to. You read too many books, you get at me all the time, you’re worse to me than Martin is to you, you piss me off, my brother’s been killed. I’m sorry to win the argument that way but there it is.
What do you mean win the argument?
I mean be nice to me.
In Belfast?
What will you do?
===
Go of course.
What is it? Who’s killed? What?
It’s Bill. Your uncle. In the army. Bill that gave you the blue teddy.
Can I have his gun?
It’s time we went home. Time you went to bed.
No it’s not.
We go home and you have tea and you have a bath and you go to bed.
Fuck off.
===
Cathy, shut up.
It’s only half past five, why don’t we –
I’ll tell you why she has to go to bed –
She can come home with me.
Because I want her out the fucking way.
===
She can come home with me.
I’m not going to bed.
I want her home with me not home with you, I want her in bed, I want today over.
And shut up or I’ll give you something to cry for.
===
I’m not going to bed.
Cathy –
You keep out of it.
They are all shouting. CATHY runs off. LIN and VICTORIA are silent. Then they laugh and embrace.
Where’s Tommy?
What? Didn’t he go with Martin?
Did he?
God oh God.
Cathy! Cathy!
I haven’t thought about him. How could I not think about him? Tommy!
Cathy! Come on, quick, I want some help.
===
Where’s Tommy? Have you seen him? Did he go with Martin? Do you know where he is?
I showed him the goose. We went in the bushes.
Then what?
===
I came back on the swing.
And Tommy? Where was Tommy?
===
He fed the ducks.
No that was before.
===
He did a pee in the bushes. I helped him with his trousers.
And after that?
He fed the ducks.
No no.
===
He liked the ducks. I expect he fell in.
Did you see him fall in?
Tommy! Tommy!
===
What’s the last time you saw him?
He did a pee.
===
Mummy said he would fall in. Oh God, Tommy!
Come on Cathy love, let’s go home.
Vicky’s got him.
Come on.
Is she cross?
No. Come on.
I found him.
I’m watching telly.
OK.
After the news.
OK.
I’m not going to bed.
Yes you are.
I’m not going to bed now.
Not now but early.
How early?
Not late.
How not late?
Early.
How early?
===
They go off together. GERRY comes on. He waits. EDWARD comes.
I’ve got some fish for dinner. I thought I’d make a cheese sauce.
I won’t be in.
Where are you going?
For a start I’m going to a sauna. Then I’ll see.
All right. What time will you be back? We’ll eat then.
You’re getting like a wife.
I don’t mind that.
Why don’t I do the cooking some time?
You can if you like. You’re just not as good at it that’s all. Do it tonight.
I won’t be in tonight.
Do it tomorrow. If we can’t eat it we can always go to a restaurant.
Stop it.
Stop what?
Just be yourself.
I don’t know what you mean. Everyone’s always tried to stop me being feminine and now you are too.
You’re putting it on.
I like doing the cooking. I like being fucked. You do like me like this really.
I’m bored, Eddy.
Go to the sauna.
And you’ll stay home and wait up for me.
No, I’ll go to bed and read a book.
Or knit. You could knit me a pair of socks.
I might knit. I like knitting.
I don’t mind if you knit. I don’t want to be married.
I do.
Well I’m divorcing you.
I wouldn’t want to keep a man who wants his freedom.
Eddy, do stop playing the injured wife, it’s not funny.
I’m not playing. It’s true.
I’m not the husband so you can’t be the wife.
I’ll always be here, Gerry, if you want to come back. I know you men like to go off by yourselves. I don’t think I could love deeply more than once. But I don’t think I can face life on my own so don’t leave it too long or it may be too late.
What are you trying to turn me into?
A monster, darling, which is what you are.
===
They sit on the bench, holding hands.
I like women.
That should please Mother.
No listen Vicky. I’d rather be a woman. I wish I had breasts like that, I think they’re beautiful. Can I touch them?
What, pretending they’re yours?
No, I know it’s you.
I think I should warn you I’m enjoying this.
I’m sick of men.
I’m sick of men.
===
The park. Summer night. VICTORIA, LIN and EDWARD drunk.
Where are you?
===
Come on.
Do we sit in a circle?
Sit in a triangle.
You’re good at mathematics. She’s good at mathematics.
Give me your hand. We all hold hands.
===
Do you know what to do?
She’s making it up.
===
We start off by being quiet.
What?
Hush.
===
Will something appear?
It was your idea.
===
It wasn’t my idea. It was your book.
You said call up the goddess.
I don’t remember saying that.
We could have called her on the telephone.
Don’t be so silly, this is meant to be frightening.
===
Kiss me.
Are we going to do it?
We’re doing it.
A ceremony.
It’s very sexy, you said it is. You said the women were priests in the temples and fucked all the time. I’m just helping.
As long as it’s sacred.
It’s very sacred.
Innin, Innana, Nana, Nut, Anat, Anahita, Istar, Isis.
I can’t remember all that.
===
Goddess of many names, oldest of the old, who walked in chaos and created life, hear us calling you back through time, before Jehovah, before Christ, before men drove you out and burnt your temples, hear us, Lady, give us back what we were, give us the history we haven’t had, make us the women we can’t be.
Chant continues under other speeches.
===
Come back, goddess.
Goddess of the sun and the moon her brother, little goddess of Crete with snakes in your hands.
Goddess of breasts.
Goddess of cunts.
===
I see her.
They stop chanting.
I see her. Very tall. Snakes in her hands. Light light light – look out! Did I give you a fright?
===
I was terrified.
Don’t spoil it Lin.
It’s all out of a book.
Innin Innana – I can’t do it now. I was really enjoying myself.
She won’t appear with a man here.
===
They had men, they had sons and lovers.
They had eunuchs.
===
Don’t give us ideas.
There’s Attis and Tammuz, they’re torn to pieces.
Tear me to pieces, Lin.
The priestess chose a lover for a year and he was king because she chose him and then he was killed at the end of the year.
Hurray.
===
And the women had the children and nobody knew it was done by fucking so they didn’t know about their fathers and nobody cared who the father was and the property was passed down through the maternal line –
Don’t turn it into a lecture, Vicky, it’s meant to be an orgy.
It never hurts to understand the theoretical background. You can’t separate fucking and economics.
===
Give us a kiss.
Shut up, listen.
What?
There’s somebody there.
Where?
===
There.
The priestesses used to make love to total strangers.
===
Go on then, I dare you.
Go on, Vicky.
He won’t know it’s a sacred rite in honour of the goddess.
===
We’ll know.
We can tell him.
It’s not what he thinks, it’s what we think.
===
Don’t tell him till after, he’ll run a mile.
The stranger approaches. It is MARTIN.
===
Well that’s all right. If all we’re talking about is having a lot of sex there’s no problem. I was all for the sixties when liberation just meant fucking.Another stranger approaches.
Hey you, come here. Come and have sex with us.
The stranger is a SOLDIER.
===
It’s my brother.
Lin, don’t.
===
It’s my brother.
It’s her sense of humour, you get used to it.
===
Shut up Vicky, it’s my brother. Isn’t it? Bill?
Yes it’s me.
And you are dead.
Fucking dead all right yeah.
Have you come back to tell us something?
No I’ve come for a fuck. That was the worst thing in the fucking army. Never fucking let out. Can’t fucking talk to Irish girls. Fucking bored out of my fucking head. That or shit scared. For five minutes I’d be glad I wasn’t bored, then I was fucking scared. Then we’d come in and I’d be glad I wasn’t scared and then I was fucking bored. Spend the day reading fucking porn and the fucking night wanking. Man’s fucking life in the fucking army? No fun when the fucking kids hate you. I got so I fucking wanted to kill someone and I got fucking killed myself and I want a fuck.
===
Let’s go home.
===
Victoria, come home with us. Victoria’s coming to live with me and Edward.
Tell me about it in the morning.
===
It’s true.
It is true.
===
Gerry, I love you.
Yes, I know. I love you, too.
You know what we did? I want to do it again. I think about it all the time. Don’t you want to any more?
===
The park. Afternoon in late summer. MARTIN, CATHY, EDWARD.
You’ll have Tommy and Cathy tonight then OK? Tommy’s still on antibiotics, do make him finish the bottle, he takes it in Ribena. It’s no good in orange, he spits it out. Remind me to give you Cathy’s swimming things.
===
I did six strokes, didn’t I Martin? Did I do a width? How many strokes is a length? How many miles is a swimming pool? I’m going to take my bronze and silver and gold and diamond.
Is Tommy still wetting the bed?
Don’t get angry with him about it.
===
I just need to go to the launderette so I’ve got a spare sheet. Of course I don’t get fucking angry, Eddy, for God’s sake. I don’t like to say he is my son but he is my son. I’m surprised I’m not wetting the bed myself.
I don’t wet the bed ever. Do you wet the bed Martin?
No.
===
I do miss the sun living in England but today couldn’t be more beautiful. You appreciate the weekend when you’re working. Betty’s been at work this week, Cathy. It’s terribly tiring, Martin, I don’t know how you’ve done it all these years. And the money, I feel like a child with money, Clive always paid everything but I do understand it perfectly well. Look, Cathy, let me show you my money.
I’ll count it. Let me count it. What’s that?
Five pounds. Five and five is –?
One two three –
Five and five is ten, and five –
===
If I get it right can I have one?
I never like to say anything, Martin, or you’ll think I’m being a mother-in-law.
Which you are.
===
Thank you, Edward, I’m not talking to you. Martin, I think you’re being wonderful. Vicky will come back. Just let her stay with Lin till she sorts herself out. It’s very nice for a girl to have a friend, I had friends at school, that was very nice. But I’m sure Lin and Edward don’t want her with them all the time. I’m not at all shocked that Lin and Edward aren’t married and she already has a child, we all know first marriages don’t always work out. But really Vicky must be in the way. And poor little Tommy. I hear he doesn’t sleep properly and he’s had a cough.
No, he’s fine, Betty, thank you.
===
My bed’s horrible. I want to sleep in the big bed with Lin and Vicky and Eddy and I do get in if I’ve got a bad dream, and my bed’s got a bump right in my back. I want to sleep in a tent.
Well Tommy has got a nasty cough, Martin, whatever you say.
===
He’s over that. He’s got some medicine.
He takes it in Ribena.
===
Well I’m glad to hear it. Look what a lot of money, Cathy, and I sit behind a desk on my own and I answer the telephone and keep the doctor’s appointment book and it really is great fun.
Can we go camping, Martin, in a tent? We could take the Dead Hand Gang.
Ice-cream bells.
===
Hello, Eddy. Thought I might find you here.
Gerry.
Not working today then?
I don’t work here any more.
Your mum got you into a dark suit?
No of course not. I’m on the dole. I am working, though, I do housework.
Whose wife are you now then?
Nobody’s. I don’t think like that any more. I’m living with some women.
What women?
It’s my sister, Vic, and her lover. They go out to work and I look after the kids.
I thought for a moment you said you were living with women.
We do sleep together, yes.
I was passing the park anyway so I thought I’d look in. I was in the sauna the other night and I saw someone who looked like you but it wasn’t. I had sex with him anyway.
I don’t think I’d like living with children. They make a lot of noise don’t they?
I tell them to shut up and they shut up. I wouldn’t want to leave them at the moment.
Look why don’t we go for a meal some time?
Yes I’d like that. Where are you living now?
Same place.
I’ll come round for you tomorrow night about 7.30.
===
Let Mrs Saunders be a warning to you, Betty. I know what it is to be unprotected.
But Mother, I have a job. I earn money.
===
Betty, what happens with a man?
You just keep still.
===
So I said to the professor, I don’t think this is an occasion for invoking the concept of structural causality – oh hello Mummy.
I’m going to ask you a question, both of you. I have a little money from your grandmother. And the three of you are living in that tiny flat with two children. I wonder if we could get a house and all live in it together? It would give you more room.
===
But I’m going to Manchester anyway.
We’d have a garden, Vicky.
===
You do seem to have such fun all of you.
I don’t want to.
===
I didn’t think you would.
Come on, Vicky, she knows we sleep together, and Eddy.
===
I think I’ve known for quite a while but I’m not sure. I don’t usually think about it, so I don’t know if I know about it or not.
I don’t want to live with my mother.
Don’t think of her as your mother, think of her as Betty.
===
But she thinks of herself as my mother.
I am your mother.
But Mummy we don’t even like each other.
===
Oh Cathy what happened?
===
She’s been assaulted.
It’s a nosebleed.
===
Took my ice cream.
Who did?
===
Is everything all right?
===
I thought you were looking after her.
They hit me. I can’t play. They said I’m a girl.
===
Those dreadful boys, the gang, the Dead Hand.
What do you mean you thought I was looking after her?
Last I saw her she was with you getting an ice cream. It’s your afternoon.
Then she went off to play. She goes off to play. You don’t keep an eye on her every minute.
===
She doesn’t get beaten up when I’m looking after her.
Took my money.
===
Why the hell should I look after your child anyway? I just want Tommy. Why should he live with you and Vicky all week?
I don’t mind if you don’t want to look after her but don’t say you will and then this happens.
===
When I get to Manchester everything’s going to be different anyway, Lin’s staying here, and you’re staying here, we’re all going to have to sit down and talk it through.
I’d really enjoy that.
===
Hit me on the face.
You were the one looking after her and look at her now, that’s all.
I’ve had enough of you telling me.
Yes you know it all.
Now stop it. I work very hard at not being like this, I could do with some credit.
===
OK you’re quite nice, try and enjoy it. Don’t make me sorry for you, Martin, it’s hard for me too. We’ve better things to do than quarrel. I’ve got to go and sort those little bastards out for a start. Where are they, Cathy?
===
Tommy’s asleep in the pushchair. We’d better wake him up or he won’t sleep tonight.
Sometimes I keep him up watching television till he falls asleep on the sofa so I can hold him. Come on, Cathy, we’ll get another ice cream.
===
Chocolate sauce and nuts.
Betty, would you like an ice cream?
===
I think you used to be Edward’s flatmate.
You’re his mother. He’s talked about you.
Well never mind children are always wrong about their parents. It’s a great problem knowing where to live and who to share with. I live by myself just now.
Good, so do I. You can do what you like.
I don’t really know what I like.
You’ll soon find out.
What do you like?
Waking up at four in the morning.
I like listening to music in bed and sometimes for supper I just have a big piece of bread and dip it in very hot lime pickle. So you don’t get lonely by yourself? Perhaps you have a lot of visitors. I’ve been thinking I should have some visitors, I could give a little dinner party. Would you come? There wouldn’t just be bread and lime pickle.
Thank you very much.
Or don’t wait to be asked to dinner. Just drop in informally. I’ll give you the address shall I? I don’t usually give strange men my address but then you’re not a strange man, you’re a friend of Edward’s. I suppose I seem a different generation to you but you are older than Edward. I was married for so many years it’s quite hard to know how to get acquainted. But if there isn’t a right way to do things you have to invent one. I always thought my mother was far too old to be attractive but when you get to an age yourself it feels quite different.
I think you could be quite attractive.
If what?
If you stop worrying.
I think when I do more about things I worry about them less. So perhaps you could help me do more.
I might be going to live with Edward again.
That’s nice, but I’m rather surprised if he wants to share a flat. He’s rather involved with a young woman he lives with, or two young women, I don’t understand Edward but never mind.
I’m very involved with him.
I think Edward did try to tell me once but I didn’t listen. So what I’m being told now is that Edward is ‘gay’ is that right? And you are too. And I’ve been making rather a fool of myself. But Edward does also sleep with women.
He does, yes, I don’t.
Well people always say it’s the mother’s fault but I don’t intend to start blaming myself. He seems perfectly happy.
I could still come and see you.
So you could, yes. I’d like that. I’ve never tried to pick up a man before.
Not everyone’s gay.
