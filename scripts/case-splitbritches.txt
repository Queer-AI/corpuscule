EMMA
What are you cookin’, Della?
DELLA
Biscuits.
EMMA
I know. But what are we havin’ for dinner?
DELLA
Biscuits.
EMMA
Do you think we could have some of those blackberry preserves on ’em?
DELLA
No, Emma, these are hard times.
EMMA
Della. We got one hundred jars stored up there in the spring house. Remember Cora. You picked them blackberries and she canned ’em.
DELLA
If we eat ’em now, Emma, we’ll starve later.
EMMA
Just like your Mama. Always thinkin’ we was gonna starve. Even when times is good.
DELLA
Hand me the rolling pin, Emma. (She laughs) What the hell for?
EMMA
And you’re always talking for everybody. You talk for the farm, you talk for the wood, you talk for the chickens, you talk for Cora . . .
CORA
I’m hungry, Della.
DELLA
I’m cooking, Cora.
EMMA
There weren’t never a time you weren’t talking for everybody . . . even when they got nothin’ to say.
DELLA
What j’say, Emma?
EMMA
Nothin’.
DELLA
Hand me the rollin’ pin, Emma.
CORA
Don’t make no difference.
EMMA
Damn bugs you got in here.
CORA
Whatcha gonna do with them bugs? Catch ’em.
EMMA
There’s plenty of them for the catchin’.
DELLA
Why don’t you stand up and do something for a change, Cora. Put on the plates for dinner.
CORA
I told him I wanted a hundred. And he come right around here the other afternoon and said he’d give me a hundred and twenty-five. What plates?
DELLA
The everyday plates. Since you hid away the fine china somewhere and I can’t find it. I make all the decisions around here, Cora, and you’re not sellin’ your land. Land is money.
EMMA
Wood.
DELLA
Remember?
EMMA
Money in the bank, wood is.
CORA
Remember what?
EMMA
(sings and is joined by Cora) Remember the wings of Gabriel as he goes on his way to the Lord!
DELLA
Yeah, wings. They’re trying to steal your land, Cora Jane, and I ain’t never cornin’ down.
CORA
I’m going for a walk . . . but that ain’t really where I’m
DELLA
I ain’t never cornin’ down. You should have seen ’em, Emma, you should have seen ’em. They were all down there waitin’ for me, waitin’ for me to sign that piece of paper, they were all down there in their city suits waitin’ for me. Well when I decided to go down there I walked up them steps and into that office and I opened the door and they were all lookin’ at me and at what I had on. Well I paid them no mind, I walked into that room and they all stepped back against the wall and when I got in the middle of the room I could feel the sun on my face. I would feel my scarf brush against my cheek, I could hear my leather jacket as I turned and got into that plane. And I took that plane down the runway. And took off up into the sky. And I kept on goin’ higher and higher in the sky . . I left all the crowds behind me . . . the sun was getting brighter and brighter . . .
EMMA
Pass me the fly swat, Della.
DELLA
And she knew they were waitin’ for her on the other side. And she took that plane up higher and higher. All she could hear was the roar of the engine and the beating of her heart. But somethin’ was wrong with the engine . . . but she paid it no mind . . . she kept on goin’ higher and higher . . . and she stayed up there . . .
EMMA
There don’t have to be no bugs and he ain’t got ’em up there . . . give you typhoid. You don’t think I seen ’em? Sure I seen ’em, leapin’ and creepin’. Well, it don’t help much you keep that screen door open. (To Della) That screen door open? (She gets no response and repeats) That screen door open? Well don’t bother! Don’t bother get that screen door fixed. They come in here anyway. It’s like they come a’courtin’. Only the only things they like to court is either hot from the oven, plum filthy or . . . dead. Dead as a nail. I keep my hair neat. I prefer it that way. The only reason they get in my hair so much ... is because . . . your hair is dead! Because every time you think something . . . and then you forget it, your hair grows out a little bit. That’s why old ladies have such long hair. And it’s the same flies every afternoon, I recognize ’em. I wonder how they find their way. So small compared to the wood and them . . . the sky and them . . . the stars and them. Well that’s durin’ the day. Durin’ the day. But at night is when the whinin’ starts. The mosquitoes! I can feel a dream coming on. I can always feel it! And I lay down and I put out the light and the whinin’ begins. And I get up and I put out the light and nothin’. So I smooth out my sheets. I’m too smart for that. And I lay down, and I put out the lights, and the whinin’ begins again.
CORA
( after much ado catching a fly) I got it, Emma! I got it!
EMMA
There ain’t no bugs in a clean house. There’s peace and quiet in a clean house and don’t got to be no bugs.
CORA
I got it, Emma!
EMMA
Eh. Well don’t bother gettin’ that screen door fixed. I’m gonna get that wood now.
CORA
I got it!
DELLA
Listen! Did you hear that, Cora?
CORA
You better leave them planes alone, Della.
EMMA
I’m not complainin’, Cora.
CORA
She got to leave the planes alone.
CORA
Chick chick chick chick (she starts dropping corn feed on the floor) chick chick chick chick chick . . .
EMMA
(en route from woodpile to chair) What’s for dinner, Della?
DELLA
Biscuits. I was going to surprise you, Emma, but you guessed.
EMMA
No. I didn’t really guess, Della.
CORA
chick chick chick chick chick chick MOOOOOOOOOOO! DELLA
EMMA
Don’t look sick to me.
CORA
That’s not the cow. (Silence) MOOOOOOOOOOO!
DELLA
The cow’s sick.
CORA
The cow is sick!
DELLA
Emma!
EMMA
The cow is sick.
DELLA
Somebody’s got to go for help!
CORA AND DELLA
I’ll go! I’LL GO!
EMMA
I’ll go.
DELLA
You can’t go Emma. You’ll fall and break yourself.
CORA
I’ll go, Della.
DELLA
You can’t find your way in the daytime, how do you expect to find your way at night? I’ll go, Cora you go with me, and Emma you stay here.
EMMA
You want me to stay here . . . alone?
DELLA
I’ll go. Emma you go with me, and Cora you stay here.
EMMA
We keep goin’ on like this, Della, we’re gonna be out of it.
CORA
I know. Emma you stay here. And I’ll stay with you . . . and Della . . . YOU go.
DELLA
You want me to go out there in the middle of the night with no moon over that hill all the way to Russell’s house . . . and leave the two of you here by yourselves. We’ll all go.
CORA
We’ll all go.
EMMA
Well now I know you asked me that question. But I forgot what the answer was supposed to be.
DELLA
Emma, the cow is sick.
EMMA
The cow is sick.
DELLA
We’re all goin’ for help.
EMMA
We’re all goin’ for help.
DELLA
Get your things, Emma.
CORA
Get your things, Emma. (She crosses over to Emma) We’re goin’ over to Russell’s house. We’re gonna get some help for that cow, Emma.
EMMA
Russell’s.
DELLA
Wait a minute. We can’t leave the kitchen with the fire burning. It’ll burn down the whole house.
EMMA
I got more wood over there. (She crosses to the woodpile) DELLA
CORA
I’m goin’ upstairs.
DELLA
Cora. The cow is sick.
CORA
There’s some things I been meanin’ to do upstairs.
DELLA
Cora, the cow is sick and I need your help.
CORA
I’d like to help you with that cow, Della, but . . . Grandma died. Grandma died and she’s layin’ upstairs on my bed. On top of all of my coupons. And I need my coupons for tomorrow because tomorrow’s Thursday, and I have to go to the store. I always go to the store on Thursday. So I got to go upstairs, Della.
DELLA
( screams) I gave up everything for you! I gave up my house in town. I gave up my job in town to come back here to this farm and take care of you, and to take care of that one over there. Now I’ve been cooking and cleaning all day and now the cow is sick and I need your help. You better get over here and help me right now!
CORA
I got these pieces and I’m gonna put ’em together. I got all these pieces I’m puttin’ ’em together. What do you think I ought to do with this? Sew it! You think I ought to knot it or you think I ought to quilt it? Blanche thinks I ought to knot it. I got all these pieces I’m gonna put ’em together. I dyed these pieces with pokeberries. Ain’t they pretty? I dyed these pieces with pokeberries. Ain’t they pretty, Emma?
EMMA
That’s right. You picked them blackberries, and she canned ’em.
CORA
Pokeberries, Emma.
EMMA
That’s right.
CORA
Pokeberries is poison.
EMMA
That’s right.
CORA
I picked the blackberries. I picked the blackberries in January.
EMMA
That’s right.
CORA
No. July. I went to Blanche’s house in January. That’s the time I went over there and took over all of my dishes. And that’s the time I was sittin’ by the window that’s got those little blue bottles on it. I always sit by that window. And I look out and I ask Blanche questions and she tells me. I say Blanche who’s that over there and she tells me. And I say what’s so-and-so doin’ over there and she tells me that. But this one time . . . that time in January when I went over there and I took over all my dishes. I was lookin’ out that window and there was a man lookin’ in at me .. . and he was smilin’ at me. He wanted to kiss me. Well I didn’t want nobody to think nothin’ bad about me, Emma, so I went away from that window and I didn’t go back.
EMMA
Where you think you’re goin’?
CORA
Visitin’.
EMMA
Who you got to visit?
DELLA
You better get over here and sit down and shut up Cora because I’m cooking dinner!
EMMA
What’s for dinner, Della?
DELLA
Biscuits.
EMMA
Well! Now the Devil he sure do find work for idle hands, now, don’t he?
CORA
I’m visiting the Devil . . . the Devil ... (to Della’s back ) the DEVIL!
DELLA SHAKES THE SPOON AT HER AND CORA STAMPS HER FOOT EMMA
That child don’t even know what she’s saying, really. DELLA
EMMA
That’s ain’t even funny Della!
DELLA
There she goes again, Cora.
CORA
The Devil’s hungry, Della.
EMMA
Talkin’ for the Devil? She must have got that from you, Della! Talkin’ for the Devil.
CORA
MOOOOOOOOOOO!
DELLA
The cow’s sick.
EMMA
Don’t look sick to me.
CORA
That’s not the cow. ( Silence) MOOOOOOOOOOO!
DELLA
The cow’s sick.
CORA
The cow is sick!
DELLA
Emma!
EMMA
The cow is sick.
DELLA
Somebody’s got to go for help!
ALL THREE
I’ll go! I’ll go.
CORA
I’ll go, Della, I got my coat on. (She exits)
EMMA
I’ll go. (She starts to exit offstage through the audience)
DELLA
Where you goin’ Cora? Where you goin’, Emma? Cora Cora!
DELLA
Go on. Go ahead and leave me here by myself. Go on, Emma! Go get your wood. Don’t make no difference to me if you’re here or if you’re not here. I’m the same woman if you’re here or not here. I’m a free woman. I do everything anyway. If you were here, I’d have to pick you up and clean under you. Don’t make no difference. It gets cold here in the winter. A draft comes through the kitchen and you gotta keep warm. You can’t keep the fire too high or it’ll burn down the whole house. I got to have my protection. I didn’t always dress like this. I didn’t always live like this, you know. I got to have my protection. This here (she takes off her coat) this is for the North Wind (she throws it downstage). This here (she removes her apron, and throws it downstage) is for the fog that comes in over the mountain. (She starts unbuttoning her dress) This is for all the mothers that thought I was after their little girls. (She takes off her dress) This is for all the little girls my Mother broke me up with because they was . . . Catholic! (She throws the dress at Emma’s chair and starts removing next layer) This is for the time in church my brother was embarrassed because he said I look like a boy. (Finishing the removal) And this is for the twenty-five dollars I saved up to go to the prostitute and I walked back and forth all day trying to get up the nerve. (She throws the dress at Cora’s cot and removes the last night shirt) And this is for all the nights I cried myself to sleep (she throws the shirt, standing in long underwear only; she goes over to her secret stash of whiskey and takes a long, luxurious slug) And this is for Amelia. AMELIA! (She sings several verses of a blues song from that period, ‘Bull Dyke Women,’ originally sung by Besse Jackson, until Emma interrupts)
EMMA
Well now! There was an old, blind turkey! I know, because I saw him! I used to know him. And all the animals used to squabble for a place to sleep. Inside (She pulls an old chair and drags it over to the woodpile) But he was blind. He couldn’t squabble. So he had to sleep outside and the weather was bad. First it rain. And after it rain, it shiver. And after it shiver, it got cold, huh! And when it got cold, he got mad, because ... I know why! Because the cold don’t make no noise. Well. He started a singin’. Because the singin’ made
EMMA
Well he heard it. And he thought he had made the stars squeak. How’d he know there were stars? (She thinks) Well. Everybody knows that. Well the birds. They started peckin’ on him. And he felt it. And he thought it was time for the dancin’ to begin. (She begins a long peregrination across the stage with the tree trunk) And it went that way. He was singin’ so they were peckin’ and he was dancin’. So they were peckin’ and they were dancin’ and he was singin’ and they were dancin’, so he was peckin’ and they were singin’ and he was dancin’ and he was peckin’ so they were singin’ and they were dancin’ . . . what the hell was I talkin’ about? Oh. There was an old blind turkey. I know, because I saw him. I used to know him. Well, it come to Thanksgivin’ one time, and the cook come after him with a knife. And he felt it. And he thought it was time for the dancin’ to start. But they killed him. And they opened him up. And when they opened him up there was . . . (she sees the bed) a place to live in there. With a bed. With the feathers of two hundred ducks in there. (She faces the table) And there was a table. With bread. And wine. And fifty turkeys. And two hundred country ham. (She sees the chair) And there was a chair by a window. In the dust. In the light. The dust dancin’ in the light. Like in church. The clean dust. Like in church. And there wasn’t no bugs. And there were two hundred girls there swattin’ the bugs there. Feel my muscle. I built this wall myself. Take a trip to California. Walk on your fingers.
DELLA
(having gotten dressed again) Emma! You seen Cora?
EMMA
Of course I seen Cora. Who do you think I see around here? I see you. And I see Cora Jane.
DELLA
Cora! Cora!
CORA
(echoing from the audience) Cora! Cora!
DELLA
I hear you, Cora! You better get in this house, Cora. CORA
DELLA
You want me to get the fly swat, Cora? Cora Jane, where are you? You better get up on this porch. Show yourself!
DELLA
Cora Jane, I’m going to count to three and you better be up on this porch. One.
CORA
Two!
DELLA
Two.
CORA
Two!
DELLA
Three! ( Cora enters from house left and Della grabs her by the shirt collar and holds her close.) Where you been Cora?
CORA
I was at the store!
DELLA
You’re too stupid to go to the store!
CORA
I WAS AT THE STORE! It’s Thursday. I always go to the store on Thursday. I go to the store on Thursday because Wednesday they deliver the kind of tobacco I always buy on Thursday! I go to the store and I buy two kinds of tobacco! I buy one for Emma and if I have enough money left over I always buy a little candy for myself. I have money to go to the store because when I collect all the eggs and I give Della twelve eggs and I keep one egg until I have my own dozen eggs. And then I go to the store. And I buy two kinds of tobacco. I buy one for Emma and I buy one for me if I have enough money left over I always buy a little candy for myself. And I buy a special kind of tobacco. The kind that’s got those little red tags on it. And if I go to the store three more times and I buy two tins of tobacco I’ll have enough little red tags to send away and get a cup and saucer like the one I took over to Blanche’s house. And I go early to the store on Thursday because I can stop by and visit people. I visit Virginia and I visit Miss Clayter and they give me things. They give me coffee. And they give me cigarettes . . . and they give me white bread. And they save me things. They save me the coupons off the evaporated milk container. And if I go to the store two more Thursdays and they give me one coupon I’m gonna have enough coupons to send away and get a salt and pepper shaker made out of a chicken! Just like the teapot is made out of a chicken!
EMMA
That reminds me of an old blind turkey!
CORA
Chicken. Chicken.
DELLA
( singing) Hey diddle!
CORA
(singing too) I’m talkin’ and nobody cares!
DELLA
Hey diddle, the cat in the fiddle .. . (she indicates Emma) She had such gentle hands! Hey diddle, the cat in the fiddle . . .
CORA
She could spit and chop like a man!
CORA AND DELLA
Hey diddle, the cat in the fiddle . .
DELLA
The flies won’t leave her alone!
CORA AND DELLA
Hey diddle, diddle, the cat in the fiddle . . .
EMMA
(rising) I ain’t never had a home of my own!
TOGETHER
Hey diddle diddle, the cat in the fiddle . . .
EMMA
Got all this land she won’t sell!
TOGETHER
Hey diddle diddle, the cat in the fiddle ...
DELLA
I’m a woman in a cold man’s Hell!
TOGETHER
Hey diddle diddle, the cat in the fiddle . ..
CORA
(crossing to table and imitating Della) I’m tired of the back of your head!
TOGETHER
Hey diddle diddle, the cat in the fiddle . . .
DELLA
(crossing to Emma’s chair , sitting down and imitating Emma) I didn’t hear what you said.
TOGETHER
Hey diddle diddle, the cat in the fiddle . ..
EMMA
(sitting on Cora’s bed and imitating her) Won’t you come and play with me?
TOGETHER
Hey diddle diddle, the cat in the fiddle . . .
CORA
( crossing and sitting on Della’s lap in Emma’s chair) If I could have a cup of tea!
TOGETHER
Hey diddle diddle, the cat in the fiddle . ..
DELLA
(pushing Cora off her lap and quickly going to the cot where Emma is sitting; sitting down and imitating Cora) I’m tired of you messing with my things! (She spits into Cora’s spit can and sits down on the cot)
TOGETHER
Hey diddle diddle, the cat in the fiddle . . .
EMMA
(crossing to the table and picking up a flour-dusted spoon, waving it in the air) I’d fly if I had wings!
CORA
Pass me the rollin’ pin!
DELLA
What the hell for?
CORA AND EMMA
That ain’t even funny, Della!
DELLA
Hey diddle, the cat in the fiddle, the dish ran away with the spoon! (All rise and start to dance) Hey diddle, the cat in the fiddle, the cow . . .
ALL
The cow’s sick.
DELLA
Don’t look sick to me.
EMMA
That’s not the cow.
CORA
MOOOOOOOOOOO!
DELLA
The cow’s sick.
CORA
The cow is sick!
DELLA
Emma!
EMMA
What are we gonna do, Della ... if that cow . . . dies? (She begins crossing downstage towards woodpile)
DELLA
We’ll survive.
CORA
What for?
DELLA
What do you mean, what for, Cora?
CORA
What for if the cow dies?
EMMA
And all the people I drive up and down the road. All the people I drive up and down the roads of this town . . . O Day, I am a lucky woman. A real lucky woman.
DELLA
Let’s go, Cora.
CORA
Wouldn’t it be nice, Della, if nobody never had to go nowhere?
EMMA
(chopping wood) They say a prayer for me and when I go, there’ll be plenty of people lined up behind my box. I can’t stop to explain.
CORA
It’s like dyin’ if the cow dies.
DELLA
Did anyone living or dead ever need you, Cora?
EMMA
I can’t stop to explain.
DELLA
Well, the cow needs me and the cow’s mighty sick.
EMMA
I’m drivin’ this train!
CORA
It’s not the cow sick, it’s you’s sick, it’s not the cow. DELLA
EMMA
Can’t stop to explain.
CORA
You’re just like Mama!
EMMA
I’m drivin’ this train!
CORA
Scared if it’s sick. Scared if it ain’t sick. If it ain’t sick, you’re scared it’s gonna get sick. If it is sick, you’re scared it’s gonna die. And I don’t know why you’re scared it’s gonna die, because everything’s gonna die. And that cow is smart, too! She’s just out there in the field giving milk and moanin’ in the dark cause she’s having a good time. MOANIN’ IN THE DARK CAUSE SHE’S HAVIN’ A GOOD TIME! MOANIN’ . . .
EMMA
What’s for dinner, Della?
DELLA
Biscuits.
EMMA
Well now I don’t mind biscuits, Della. But do you think we could have some of those blackberry preserves on ’em? With some ham hock. And some red-eye gravy. With some greens. And some green beans. And some bread. With some wine. And some yams. And some greens . . .
DELLA
Emma! (She leans over and sees something in Emma's eyes) Cora Jane! You better go upstairs and get your Aunt Emma what she wants.
EMMA
Some ham . . .
DELLA
Some ham . . .
EMMA
Some ham hock.
DELLA
Ham hock ... go on, Cora.
EMMA
Red-eye gravy . . . greens.
DELLA
Red-eye gravy ... go on Cora ... I said go up and get your Aunt Emma what she wants . . . go on . . .
CORA
I’m goin’ upstairs . . . I’m goin’ upstairs, Emma. (She crosses upstage , hiding in the hack of the kitchen)
DELLA
I bet you think she ain’t never cornin’ down, Emma. She stayed up there. She never came down. Don’t you think she’s been gone a long time, Emma, I say, Emma! Don’t you think Cora been gone a long time. Cora! You better get down here, Cora. I don’t hear her, Emma, I don’t hear anything up there. What if something happened to her? What if she fell? It would be all my fault.
DELLA
(turning round and seeing Cora) Cora! Why you hidin’ behind me like that? Just like your Daddy.
CORA
(putting her head in Della's chest; singing) Tempted and tried we’re oft made to wonder why it should be thus all day long. While there are others livin’ around us, never molested though in the wrong. Farther along . . . (the tempo of the hymn takes on a waltz; Della takes Cora in her arms and they begin to dance) . . . we’ll know all about it. Farther along we’ll understand why! Cheer up my sister, live in the sunshine . . .
EMMA
Goin’ to the dance, Della?
DELLA
I haven’t been to a dance in twenty years, Emma.
CORA
. . . we’ll understand it, all by and by. Farther along we’ll know about it . . . farther along we’ll . . . I’m dancin’, Emma! I’m dancin! Farther along we’ll understand why!
EMMA
I don’t know how you expect to be a Christian and be thinkin’ about dancin’ all the time.
CORA
(breaking out of the dance) I think we’re gonna have to stop dancin’, Della. I think the preacher’s cornin’.
DELLA
The preacher ain’t comin, Cora. I can smell a preacher cornin’ a mile away. Ain’t no preacher gonna get past that gate, Cora.
CORA
The preacher’s coming, Della.
DELLA
I did go to a dance twenty years ago, Cora, it was on Halloween. A masquerade ball.
CORA
A social.
EMMA
It was a social.
DELLA
I got all dressed up. I wore my grandaddy’s boots and I wore his pants and I slicked back my hair and I went to the dance and nobody recognized me so I danced with whoever I wanted to dance with and I smoked cigarettes and I drank whiskey . . .
CORA
You better leave them planes alone, Della.
EMMA
I’m not complaining, Cora.
CORA
She got to leave the planes alone.
DELLA
Listen. Did you hear that? I got to go now, darlin’. I got to join my troops! Will you always love me? Say you’ll always love me.
CORA
I’ll always love ya.
DELLA
Don’t ever leave me. Say you’ll never leave me.
CORA
I’ll never leave ya.
DELLA
I’ll he back soon, darlin’. (She salutes)
CORA
I’ll be back soon, darlin’. (She imitates Della’s salute) DELLA
CORA
Bye, darlin’! (They kiss)
DELLA
Bye! (She returns to the biscuits)
CORA
Bye! Bye! Bye, darlin’! Bye! Where do you think you’re goin’? To the store! It’s Thursday. I always go to the store on Thursday. Bye! Bye! Bye! You want me to stay here alone? Bye! Bye! Bye! I can’t move in the dark.
EMMA
Cora Jane.
CORA
I can’t move in the dark. I can’t move in the dark.
EMMA
(crossing to Cora) Cora Jane, I think it’s time we had a little foot washin’ now. Come on now, get the water. Come on, now . . . (She sings) We’ll work! Till Jesus comes, we’ll work till Jesus comes, we’ll work till Jesus comes and we’ll be gathered home!
DELLA
What are you doing, Emma? Cora, don’t take off your shoes. You need protection, Cora. You remember when you went to Blanche’s house and she took off all your clothes and gave you a bath and you got pneumonia . . .
EMMA
(joined by Cora in song) When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more. And . . . sounds eternal bright and fair! And the saved of the Earth shall gather over on the other shore . . . and the role is called up yonder I’ll be there.
DELLA
You think Jesus is going to call your name all day like I do? Cora! Emma! Jesus don’t care about you. I’m the only one that cares about you.
CORA
(speaking within the slide) That’s one way that Della could get Cora was through her little treasures.
EMMA
(simultaneously) They all used to get up there and play dolls together. Cora and Emma . . . and Della too.
DELLA
(simultaneously) Della told me she had cash money in the bank for both their funerals . . . and she did.
CORA
Cora Jane Gearheart. Born in 1890, died in 1949. Emma Gay Gearheart. Born 1863, died 1952.
DELLA
Fire ain’t just a thing, it’s a person, I mean, it ain’t a person, it’s a livin’ thing. Got a mind of it’s own.
CORA
There was a brushfire there on the hill and they all got out there fightin’ it ... I guess Cora Jane just got too excited . .. she started peein’ and she couldn’t stop. She died the next day of kidney failure.
DELLA
I seen fires. I’ve felt them on my skin. I heard them cracklin’ in my ear, even in the rain. Fires think. They got purposes.
EMMA
Emma Gay had a peaceful death. She died one morning in bed.
DELLA
Once I saw a whole farm burn down. And all the cows and chickens. And the fire went out and brought in other creatures from miles around . . . big black birds that flew upside down next to the fire. And the fire held them there with a string tied to their wings in order to scare all the animals to death. I seen a chicken fall over and the fire went up and ate up its whole body and burped out a big white smoke! I heard dogs barkin’ but there wasn’t no dogs. And I got fire eatin’ inside of me. I can feel it but you can’t see it. And that makes me be a person with a secret. I can feel it in my eyes. I can feel it in my chest. And I can feel it in other places.
CORA
Della Mae lived for fifteen years alone on that farm, and then she finally sold it. To a stranger. And the very next Halloween that farmhouse burned down.
DELLA
I feel like that farmhouse . . . and dry. And that fire can make ashes out of me if I ain’t careful. Once I had fire in my pocket. I put my hand in and pulled it out real quick, and I said, why’d I do that? And I looked in my pocket, and there was the fire, lookin’ up at me just cute and sweet as a pretty girl. (She leans over Emma) That ain’t even funny, Della! But then it starts to hurt. So you got to beat it. You got to put it out, Emma. Cora!
CORA
She spent the rest of her years in a rooming house in town, and in 1974 Della Mae was buried right between Emma Gay and Cora Jane .. . and to this day not a blade of grass is growin’ on her grave.
DELLA
Sometimes I think the fire waits until the whole world is bored, and then it comes along to entertain ’em. But it hurts to laugh. Do you know ... by the time the men got there, there was nothin’ left. It was burned right down to the ground. It’s fire steals the land for real.
