SPINOZA DACOSTA
But, my lord, we cannot afford further expenditures. The assembly demands an accounting of all moneys. We must not ignore--

EDWARD HYDE
Was it ill conceived to choose this blue manto, my dear Spinoza, when the willow green would have suited my eyes, or the scarlet given definition to my great determination? Kneller, Her Majesty's favorite painter, told me once, "A royal portrait is a royal portrait. Leave it to Sarah Churchill to be captured playing at cards, but royalty must stand like the gods. They must be metaphor." Well, we can't all be seen as Queen Anne in the role of Justice...

[EDWARD holds an imaginary sword and scales.]

admired by the three Graces while she's kicking Envy...

[EDWARD kicks Envy.]

with her gouty foot.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Excuse me, your lordship, on the matters we spoke of--

EDWARD HYDE
[ Arranging gown]

Still, I have other stuffs as fine as this, and this is better than anything found in sad New York. I wish I could be painted in all my favorite clothes. My silver-tissue manto, lined with the palest sky-blue. My crimson velvet under-petticoat with lace. My rich fox muff. My cherry-colored silk nightgown, lined with lutestring. I drink my chocolate in that and wipe my lips on a fine Turkish handkercher embroidered in gold. You must send for some amber powder and a paper of patches.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
The treasury is empty, my lord.

EDWARD HYDE
Sell Staten Island!... Oh, what do these Dutch women know, those somber gowns? Ladies, ladies, I have seen enough black, enough mourning hangings, to last a lifetime. Those Dutch have come and they even bring their smell. Ah, me, memories.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
My lord, these same Dutch are--

( We hear harpsichord music--Couperin--from another room.)

EDWARD HYDE
Those wretched towns we passed on the way to The Hague. Even the winds of a new continent can't blow away the stink of pickled fish. Well, these Dutch broodmares have had a paragon, an example, for the last seven years. A master-mistress, who would chide but who could teach. And they have not learned, have rejected the metaphor that I am.

[ Striking a Baroque pose]

Civilization! The core is male...

[ Breaking the pose into an undulating deep curtsy]

the surface yielding.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
'Tis true, my lord, we must yield. At this very moment in Saint Mark's Church, your Dutch subjects gather to voice their displeasure.

EDWARD HYDE
Of that, my good Jew, I am well aware and do intend to inform myself further in my own way. Be at ease. The light grows dark, and soon begins your Sabbath. You are excused.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Good night, my lord... and take care.

[ Exits bowing.]

EDWARD HYDE
[ Puts on jewels and arranges his wig and details of his gown.]

In my seven bitter years as governor of this dismal town only Sarah Vanderspiegel seemed to soften, to turn, and Margareta van Cortlandt took to carrying a peacock fan till she became the wife of Abraham de Peyster. Milord de Peyster, from what Dutch swamp were you spawned? We have all been vomited on this continent. De Peyster was belched forth from a marsh, and I was hurled across an angry ocean by my cousin royal, Anne, the Queen.

As children we played together at Windsor, hide and seek in the garden at Saint James, and we told each other secrets in a little wilderness of yew and holly, away from the formal paths and fountains.

[ Confidentially]

Once while we were whispering together we saw one of the footmen playing with his big thing, his breeches down. Lady Frances laughed when Anne told her; I, silly boy, followed him around the palace until ...

[ Mock embarrassment]

She was ever such a pasty-faced little girl. And later when her succession to the throne seemed more than possible, how solemn, dutiful, and, oh, so stubborn, she became. So Protestant princess--not like ma cousine her older sister, Mary, who blended the Stuart majesty of her royal father with the easy charm of her mother's family, my family, our family, the Hyde family. Who would have thought there would be so many queens among us?

[ The music stops.]

Ah, me, Mary had William to guide her, lead her. She accepted his favorites, and even smiled when she stumbled on us romping together at the Old Palace. The Duke of Portland was furious because William wanted to bugger me and not him. Such a scene. And who should walk in but Mary, with some idea of founding a college.

( Enter AFRICA, massaging her fingers like Wanda Landowska. She is a beautiful young black woman draped

in her native garb. Although presently a slave, she is in no way obsequious or hostile.)

EDWARD HYDE
Dearest Africa, you've practiced enough today. What seems to be the matter with the back of this gown? Is the clasp undone? Please do look at it.

AFRICA
The moths have eaten the stuff around the hook, your lordship.

EDWARD HYDE
Susanna Rhinelander must have brought them with her along with the pox.

AFRICA
It was a pretty belt.Well, all suffers alteration here. I was a princess of a proud people, and now I am your lordship's servant.

EDWARD HYDE
How many times have I told you that it is an honor to serve a person of quality? The noble serve the noble. In England the most powerful families vie to have one of their ladies attached to the queen. Surely you remember what I have told you: Sarah, the powerful Duchess of Marlborough, is the Queen's First Lady of the Chamber, and for that matter, entre nous...

[EDWARD makes an obscene gesture.]

And in France, where I spent a good part of my youth, it is deemed an honor to be with the King when he is taking a physic. How the French worship the enema. Quick, a looking glass.

AFRICA
[ Fetching a looking glass]

I had twenty slaves at home to do my bidding.

EDWARD HYDE
As an Englishman I abhor slavery, but the Dutch will have their filthy habits. I didn't bring you here; I found you here. Our late King William tried to have geography taught to young William--

AFRICA
Duke of Gloucester, Princess Anne's only surviving son--

EDWARD HYDE
A spindly thing with an enormous head. I remember the map his Majesty had drawn for the poor boy--the Niger rising from a great lake close to the Nile, running in a thick bold line straight to the Atlantic; places called Congoland, Nubia, and Abyssinia all beautifully

printed.

[ While EDWARD rambles on, AFRICA sings a tribal dirge.]

It did no good. Little Billy died. We all had to wear black again. And again. We were hardly ever out of mourning. Just when we started to wear something bright, Anne would have another miscarriage. I was ready to die myself when she had her eighteenth. Mercifully, she stopped trying for the Protestant cause after that.

[ Puts down the mirror.]

Do stop that moaning; it puts me in ill humor.

Of what use is it to dress here? I haven't seen the beau monde for seven long years. Do they still wear their hair so, with curls placed here and there?

(AFRICA starts singing a lively and rhythmic tune.)

EDWARD HYDE
Ah, that's better. What does it signify?

AFRICA
"The lion has given us his nails, the snake his fangs, the wambaku his eyes--"

EDWARD HYDE
The wambaku?

AFRICA
Please not to interrupt, your lordship. I lose the thought... "The tumba his ears, and the tree spirit his wisdom. To trap our enemies, to kill our enemies, to eat their hearts."

EDWARD HYDE
I fancy that lively song.

AFRICA
In my land it is forbidden for a woman to sing it. But here...

[ She shrugs.]

EDWARD HYDE
I know. It's all topsy-turvy. Enemies, the prey, revenge--'tis the same all over the globe. My cloak, please,

[AFRICA fetches a ratty beaver cape.]

No, not the sheared beaver. Lordy, how I hate that fur.The black cape with the hood. I'll be late, late. Sing that tune again. "The lion has given us his nails." I go into the very mouth of the beast. Ah, and tell my good wife not to wait up for me.

(EDWARD exits hurriedly wearing the hooded cape, AFRICA continues chanting for a beat, soon to be overlapped by the hymn of the next scene.)

Act 1, Scene 2
Scene 2

Church of Saint Mark's-on-the-Bouwerie. A meeting of Calvinists. The CONGREGATION, soberly dressed in blacks and browns, standing, sings the following hymn, accompanied by organ. The style is Bach.

CONGREGATION
A mighty fortress is our Lord:
Blood and guts anoint His sword.
The cannon's roar proclaims His Son.
Only by us will His will be done

The severed head still sings His name,
The broken arm salutes His fame.
Narrow the path, straight the gate,
The love of Him on earth is hate.

( Enter EDWARD, hooded and unnoticed. He takes his place among the CONGREGATION.)

A loaded pistol is our God;
On our necks His feet have trod.
A heavy weight is heavenly bliss,
Brushing our lips with a deadly kiss.
Hallelujah and amen.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
[ From lectern. He looks like a hawk.]

We have gathered together that we may praise in proper Protestant prayer the goodness of the Lord and then sign a petition to Her English Majesty Queen Anne to remove the wicked Pharaoh Cornbury.

[ Reading from petition]

"We the undersigned, all honest and loyal tax-paying subjects of the colony of New Amsterdam--"

RIP VAN DAM
[ An extremely handsome blond young man in his early twenties. Earnest.]

'Tis called New York now, Father. That would offend the Queen.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
York, York, York! Like geese in November.

[ Ranting, he corrects the petition.]

MARGARETA DE PEYSTER
[ A forceful widow of forty. She speaks with authority.]

Get to the meat of it, Cornelius.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
"--do hereby request of Her Royal Highness that the Governor be removed from office, the reasons being the following:

"That Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, has demeaned his office by the disgusting and unnatural practice of dressing in women's attire at public functions, not to mention even more ungodly behavior in private, his explanation being that since he represents the person of a female sovereign he must dress like one."

VOICES
Shame! Shame!

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
[ Smugly smiling, he stops short the voices with a gesture.]

"That he openly tolerates Indians and Negroes, and encourages Jews to settle."

VOICE 1
Even his secretary is a Jew.

VOICE 2
Spinoza Dacosta.

VOICE 3
That bloodsucker!

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
"The governor has declared that the tint of one's skin and religious predilection are matters of chance, taste, and habit. And even worse, that the Bible-sanctioned practice of slavery is an evil that must be abolished."

VOICE 1
He would have us scrub our own floors!

VOICE 2
Who would till the fields?

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
"That he allows his wife to pray in the Popish manner and has permitted the erection of a brazen image of the Virgin of Rome within the confines of his official residence."

VOICE 3
To the stake with Lady Cornbury!

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
"That said wife is an inveterate thief, and is totally unable to control her vile habit of purloining the valuables of loyal subjects while on official visits."

( This accusation provokes the greatest outrage.)

WOMAN 1
She stole my brooch!

WOMAN 2
She stole my necklace!

WOMAN 3
She stole my chamberpot!

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
"And, finally, that Lord Cornbury is guilty of corruption in financial matters.

"Item: He has sold crown lands without Her Majesty's permission."

VOICE
He sold Staten Island three times to three different people.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
"Item: He has publicly proclaimed the price of an audience with himself at two shillings sixpence for the first quarter hour--"

VOICE 1
The same price as the whores!

VOICE 2
And you have to pay the Jew another shilling!

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
"Item: He has borrowed vast sums and now refuses repayment on the grounds of sovereign immunity."

VOICE 1
Down with Cornbury!

VOICE 2
Out with the sodomite!

VOICE 3
Over with Hanover!

VOICE 4
New York is Dutch!

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
"Therefore we do petition Your Highness to provide the colonies with an honest yet fair, just yet merciful, manly new governor."

MARGARETA
Well said, Cornelius.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
Thank you, Margareta.

RIP VAN DAM
This man is a menace to manhood. When he sees our petition he'll go at once.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
We are agreed. But who will show it to him?

MARGARETA
Why not yourself, Cornelius?

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
He vowed to have me thrashed if I came into his sight.

VOICE
What new infamy is this?

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
He claims I stole some lands from the Indians--

VOICE 1
There wasn't an Indian left in the Bronx!

VOICE 2
That's no crime!

VOICE 3
He desecrates another tradition!

MARGARETA
Perhaps young Rip van Dam should present the petition. I think he would have no trouble gaining his lordship's audience--without charge, too.

RIP VAN DAM
But if we are alone he might--

MARGARETA
You are a Christian man. Defend yourself with your virtue--and wear a sword.

RIP VAN DAM
I shall do it. For the sake of our people!

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
For the sake of our Lord!

MARGARETA
For the sake of our money! Who will be the first to sign after me?

[ She steps forward to sign the document.]

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
Let us pray.

( Hymn recommences, EDWARD exits furtively.)

MARGARETA
[ Signing]

( The singing swells to full volume as the song of the following scene begins.)

Act 1, Scene 3
Scene 3

Fat Molly's, a Bouwerie dive, EDWARD, still incognito, enters, as MOLLY, the slatternly owner, sings a duet with the bouncy barmaid, MARTHA. The ballad they sing refers to the notorious love affair between Queen Anne and the Duchess of Marlborough, Sarah Churchill.

MARTHA
I'll always be true to you, my love,
I'll always be true to you.

MOLLY
I favor this part, Martha, my sweet. Our good Queen, mighty though she is, has her portion of misery. Sarah Churchill is as wicked as you.

MARTHA
Wicked? You know you're first in my heart, Molly.

MOLLY
If not, dearie, it's back to the docks, where I found you.

[ Slaps MARTHA' s ass and sings, as Queen Anne:]

Though fashions change and treaties wane
And couples pledge their troth in vain,
I to you will constant be,

Faithful, kind, and husbandly.
I'll always be true to you, my love.
I'll always be true to you.

MARTHA
[ As Sarah Churchill]

Honored thus, my gracious Queen,
You give me more than I could dream.
But grant you please your little mouse
A large and stately country house.
I'll always be true to you, my love,
I'll always be true to you.

MOLLY
Though Whigs and Tories assail my head,
And for my Prince these legs must spread,
'Tis you who's ever in my thoughts,
Though Spanish ships attack my ports.
I'll always be true to you, my love,
I'll always be true to you.

MARTHA
I take your pledge and give you mine,
My breasts, my twat, forever thine.
But for love's sake, my husband Anne,
Pray give the Churchills lots of land.
I'll always be true to you, my love,
I'll always be true to you.

EDWARD HYDE
[ Throwing back his hood. He recites an improvised verse.]

So vowed the Queen to her fair maid,
And Mistress Churchill was well paid.
For thus she fought her husband's war,
Proved mother, wife, and damned fine whore.

( All laugh.)

MOLLY
That's a new one--and so naughty, Governor. You deserve the best for that.

[ She pours him a drink. He surveys the empty bar.]

A bit early, milord?

EDWARD HYDE
Where is everyone, Moll?

MOLLY
It's those damned Hollanders. I thought this town was English. Mind you, I hate no man so long as his coin be true, but these herring-eaters should watch their own itching privates and leave us to scratch our own.

It's getting so that as soon as you take your coffee and have your morning shit--begging your pardon,--curfew begins. And if we should so much as light a candle past seven o'clock, some tallow-faced hymn-singer throws a rock through the windows. Mind you, milord, I'm a Christian woman, but 'tis sad to see the state to which the Bouwerie is fallen. Gone, all gone, the Captain's, the Nest, the Green Parrot, and One-Eyed Peg's--Lord knows I hated that low bitch but she knew her business well. New York was a jolly place: twelve roaring taverns on one road, each filled with lasses to do your biddin' and boyos to fill your pleasure. We had anything you could dream up, no matter how quaint your taste.

[ She winks.]

If you know what I mean.

[ She proposes a toast.]

Here's to the old days.

[ Familiarly]

I never met a man who took his pleasures so keenly...

[ She slaps EDWARD on the back.]

or was so choosy about what lay next to his skin. Here, Martha, feel this stuff,

[MARTHA does so.]

Beggin' your leave, Governor, when will this Calvinist physic be done with? The best have left for Philadelphia. So much revenue lost to your lordship. But your fat Moll is yet loyal.

[ Digs in bosom and hands EDWARD a purse. He counts the coins in it.]

Let those hypocrites fart their righteousness down on us, here's one English bitch who won't give in.

(MARTHA giggles.)

EDWARD HYDE
[ Pocketing the money]

I'll see that you're not disturbed, good Moll. Be assured, it was not my notion to persecute my loyal friends. But the de Peysters and van Cortlandts, who were here before I came, must needs be reckoned with.

MOLLY
Like any pox that ruins a man's pleasure. But we'll not let them diminish ours....

[ She drinks from a bottle.]

Have you seen the latest step? 'Twas a Portuguese sailor taught it to our Martha--along with a few other tricks, I warrant. Come, girl, give his lordship a lesson.

(MOLLY beats time and hums as MARTHA dances, EDWARD watches.)

EDWARD HYDE
'Tis a familiar step. It was introduced at court by Catherine of Braganza, and if my memory serves me, you turn thus ...

[ Now leading the dance]

... and thus.

[ Curtsies.]

MARTHA
The governor knows more than the sailor.

EDWARD HYDE
And wait! There's a jeté right here.

(EDWARD gracefully dances his way into the next scene, the music for which has already begun.)

Act 1, Scene 4
Scene 4

A chamber in the governor's mansion. Offstage, AFRICA is singing another native song, EDWARD throws off his cloak, revealing a scarlet court dress trimmed with jet. He reclines on a Queen Anne chaise longue.

EDWARD HYDE
Africa, Africa! Cease that savage wailing! You know I can't stand primitive music.

( Enter AFRICA.)

AFRICA
That was the sacred Revenge and Fertility for Yams chant. Only a daughter of royal blood is permitted to lend her voice to it.

EDWARD HYDE
Africa, darling, we're in the New World now. Royal prerogative has no place in this mosquito-infested bog. We must alter our natures to suit the clime. How do I look?

AFRICA
Pearls, my lord.

EDWARD HYDE
Pearls? Pearls. Fetch them,

[AFRICA throws pearls to EDWARD, who divests himself of other jewelry by throwing it behind a screen. He puts on strands of pearls. Looking at himself in a mirror]

You're always right.

You're the only person with taste on this side of the ocean.

AFRICA
Why are you wearing such finery today?

EDWARD HYDE
I have a matter of importance to attend to. My unruly subjects are preparing an attack against my person; I am wearing suitable armor.

AFRICA
Prithee, let me watch this battle.

( A loud knocking is heard.)

EDWARD HYDE
That will be Master Rip van Dam. Bid him enter. And, of course, you may lend an ear behind the door if you wish some amusement, Princess.

( Exit AFRICA. EDWARD tries out various feminine poses on the chaise. Reenter AFRICA, leading RIP, who is wearing a sword.)

AFRICA
Master Rip van Dam, my lord.

( Exit AFRICA. RIP stares speechless as EDWARD "adjusts" himself.)

EDWARD HYDE
You don't like me in red. I knew it. It was definitely a day for blue.

RIP VAN DAM
My lord, I have here--

[ Takes out petition.]

EDWARD HYDE
Don't say it. You're aching to read me a billetdoux. Best keep it a secret. Whisper it, sing it softly as a lullaby, thrust it into the grate, but don't pronounce your words of love no matter how fiercely the arrows sear your heart.

RIP VAN DAM
[ Reading]

"We the undersigned--"

EDWARD HYDE
I know, the whole colony loves me. You've thought of no one but me since the day I set foot on shore. My eyes, my hair, my legs... Don't say it.

RIP VAN DAM
But, my lord, you disgust me.

EDWARD HYDE
I understand, foolish boy. You feel unworthy of me and thus mask your admiration. But we are alone now, Rip--may I call you Rip? You may call me--oh,

call me what you will. We are alone now. Bruise me with your words. Cornbury understands all.

[ He seizes the petition and rips it up.]

RIP VAN DAM
[ Outraged]

You, you--

EDWARD HYDE
Pervert. Say it, Rip!

RIP VAN DAM
You are a revolting--

EDWARD HYDE
Catamite. Say it, Calvinite!

RIP VAN DAM
May God damn you and strike you dead.

EDWARD HYDE
Comprendre, c'est pardonner. I can scarce accept your proposal for I am married.

RIP VAN DAM
Proposal? If I should touch you, I would--

EDWARD HYDE
Vomit. Vomit from love. Eros strikes each differently. Your ardor makes me blush. Which part of me pleases you most, Master Rip?

RIP VAN DAM
You are hideous from head to toe. A man is a man, a woman is a woman. You are a--

EDWARD HYDE
You find me unique. And that piques your interest. Here, see if you can pique mine,

[EDWARD suddenly rises and with manly gestures takes a sword from the wall. He assumes a fencing position.]

You worship Lord Cornbury. Admit it.

[RIP has drawn his sword, EDWARD strikes it. They duel. EDWARD duels superbly. RIP' s efforts, in comparison, are clumsy.]

You adore Lord Cornbury. ...

[ They continue dueling. EDWARD is winning.]

You love Lord Cornbury....

[EDWARD is at RIP' s throat.]

You love Lord Cornbury, don't you, my boy?

[ Deep and menacing]

Ah? Ah? Say it!!

RIP VAN DAM
[ From floor]

I love Lord Cornbury.

EDWARD HYDE
You may call me Edward. Whom do you love?

RIP VAN DAM
I love Edward.

EDWARD HYDE
[ Releasing him and suddenly coquettish]

Well, EDWARD loves you not and is shocked that you would be so forward. Africa!

[AFRICA appears immediately.]

Master van Dam wishes to depart.

[ Tosses RIP his sword.]

Show him out, I pray you.

[ Flings himself on the chaise longue and fans himself.]

We shall see you at the Queen Anne Birthday Ball. I promise you the second gavotte. Good night.

( Blackout, covered by loud Korngold movie music.)

Act 1, Scene 5
Scene 5

The chamber of SPINOZA DACOSTA. SPINOZA is at his small rough-hewn desk looking at an INDIAN seated on a stool. The Native American, MUNSEE, is of the Delaware tribe-a Lenape. He is tall, muscular, and imposing. He wears his long hair loose and oiled. He sports shell jewelry. He looks sexy in his animal-skin clothing. His chest is daubed with ocher. SPINOZA is holding up his hand, trying to learn the Lenape words for the numbers 1 through 7.

MUNSEE
[ In Lenape]

N'gutti... nischa... nacha... newo... pal-enach... guttasch... nischasch.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
[ In Hebrew]

Echade... shtayim... shalosh... arba... chamesh... shesh... sheva.

(MUNSEE gracefully describes the four seasons in sign language, giving each one their Lenape name.)

MUNSEE
[ For spring]

Sickquan.

SPINOZA DACOSTA

MUNSEE
[ For summer]

SPINOZA DACOSTA

MUNSEE
[ For autumn]

[ For winter]

[ Indicating himself]

MUNSEE
[ Also indicating himself]

SPINOZA DACOSTA
[ Describing the curves of a woman with hands]

Woman.

MUNSEE
Ochquen.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
[ Excited]

Adam and Eve! Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob! Cain and Abel! Israel! Yerooshehlieeem!!... I must control myself. I feel on the verge of a great discovery. God, Thou hast given Thy servant the joy of finding his brother--his lost brother--whom Thou in Thy wrath hast scattered across the earth to taste the bitter fruit of exile. Thy goodness doth prevail! Patience, I must have patience.

[ Making broad, sweeping gestures

in the air]

The Lord is here. He surrounds us. Thou art my brother, lost Israel!

[ Approaching MUNSEE]

You found refuge in this land until the moment the Lord should summon you to return. I am the instrument of His mercy and shall instruct you in the ways of our people! My brother, what do they call you?

[ Indicating himself]

My name is... Spinoza Dacosta.

MUNSEE
[ In English]

Me...

[ He howls like a wolf.]

Me Munsee.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Wolf! I shall call you Zev, which means wolf in God's tongue. Zev! Zevi!

[ He attempts to embrace his brother but is repelled by the body paint.]

Feh!

( Enter PASTOR VAN DAM and MARGARETA. They are carrying a package which contains a beaver dressed for the pot. They are startled to find DACOSTA talking to MUNSEE.)

MARGARETA
It's useless, DACOSTA, to teach them anything. They are incapable of thought.

[ She notices that DACOSTA is rubbing his hands.]

And that rancid fish oil they put on their bodies--ach!--how can you stand so close?

SPINOZA DACOSTA
[ Bows to them.]

Mistress de Peyster, Pastor van Dam, what a beautiful surprise.

MARGARETA
Cornelius, give Dacosta the package.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
[ Does so.]

It is a beaver prepared for the pot. I'm sure your wife will put it to good use. You know the tail can be eaten as a Lenten dish--but then, that's not important to you.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
[ Gives beaver to MUNSEE.]

Take this to my good wife, Leah. You will find her in the kitchen.

[ He quickly mimes a kitchen. MUNSEE leaves.]

I thank you, Mistress de Peyster. We are fortunate in having a less than severe winter. I remember last year the snow--

MARGARETA
Shall we dispense, Dacosta, with talk that is tiresome to all of us?

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
Better a cold winter than the fires of hell.

MARGARETA
[ In Dutch, to PASTOR]

Hou je mond, domme dwaas!

(Be quiet, you stupid fool!) [ To SPINOZA]

If we

had time enough there would be many things that would give delight to speak of, but let us get to the point.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
By all means, madam. A humble public servant is not often favored by a visit from the gentry.

MARGARETA
As you are aware, much of the land in East and West Jersey has been seized by the English crown--

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Madam, the landowners voluntarily surrendered their governmental powers to the crown in 1702. They retained some of their land rights.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
They say that Queen Anne has Jewish blood.

MARGARETA
Donder op, klootzak!

(Quiet, you asshole!)

But such confusion resulted. Those dirty Swedes think they own the Delaware Valley, and greedy Quakers claim East Jersey because the half-witted widow of Governor Carteret's cousin sold land she never owned. Those rapacious Scottish tradesmen set up a few mud huts on a dung heap and called it Perth Amboy.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
I am presently preparing a report on this very matter.

MARGARETA
Then make note that all the land from the Hackensack River to the Kittatinny Mountains should be leased to us. I, with some of my van Cortlandt cousins, could easily assume his lordship's burden. We would cut down those bothersome forests, remove the remaining red men, and reap a fine harvest of skin and furs.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
But what, dear madam, can I do?

MARGARETA
To quote an old Dutch proverb: " Tookhis oyfn tish."

SPINOZA DACOSTA
[ With disdain]

I'm familiar with the expression. I value the honesty of your address, madam, but to quote an old Hebrew proverb: "What's in it for me?"

MARGARETA
A goodly portion, Dacosta. As Lord Cornbury's secretary, you stand to influence his thinking. The disposal of crown lands is his decision. The governor has so much land and so many pressing debts--'tis rumored that his last state robe alone cost a month's revenue.

[ Walks about the office appraising it. Winningly]

When I was a little girl in Amsterdam we had many friends of

the Hebrew faith. We Dutch opened our cities to them. For we too had tasted the bitter yoke of Catholic Spain.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
Verdomde spanjaarden!

(Damned Spaniards!)

MARGARETA
It must not seem strange to you, my dear Dacosta, that we wish to preserve some fine Dutch traditions. Therefore, with open heart we offer you--nay, your people here in New Amsterdam--a final haven: a portion of land from the West Jersey claim to be used by your tribe as a cemetery.

[ She folds her arms, satisfied.]

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Thank you, Madame de Peyster. Dutch hospitality is well known to our people. And your concern for our dead is most touching, but may I be so bold as to press for the rights of those living, namely a fraction of those lands you wish to lease given over to those of us in New York of the Hebrew faith.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
Verdomde joden!

(Damned Jews.)

MARGARETA
Impossible. What do Jews need land for? Can a Jew plant? Can a Jew clear forests? Can a Jew defend himself against a savage horde?

( Enter MUNSEE with the beaver tail. SPINOZA is relieved by this interruption.)

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Ah, Zev, how fares my good wife Leah?

MUNSEE
[ Thrusts package to the PASTOR with distaste.]

Take. Wife say thank you. Tomaque...

[ Pointing to package]

Beaver is matta... trayf.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
Maak je weg komt, wildeman!

(Savage, get out!)

( Exit MUNSEE.)

MARGARETA
When we receive the land rights to the West Jersey tracts, you shall receive the deeds to a plot of land sufficient for a fine new synagogue and the right to dwell within its precincts.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Mistress, you are bidding for territories that are as vast as your mother country. I ask for only one tenth of that. Is that too much to ask?

MARGARETA
[ Outraged]

Now, attend, Jew. Your association with the corrupt governor puts your people in a precarious position. If that debt-ridden monstrosity were to lose favor with the English queen--

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
Verdomde engelse hoer!

(Damned English whore!)

SPINOZA DACOSTA
[ Holding up hand]

One eighth!

MARGARETA
Parasite!

SPINOZA DACOSTA
One seventh!

MARGARETA
Christ-killer!

SPINOZA DACOSTA
One sixth!

MARGARETA
Bloodsucker!

SPINOZA DACOSTA
One fifth!

MARGARETA
Vermin! Leech! Accursed race!

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
Shylock!

MARGARETA
Usurer!

( The preceding epithets overlap the following scene. ANNA MARIA BAYARD and RIP VAN DAM are promenading in a pasture on the site of present-day Prince Street near Macdougal.)

Act 1, Scene 6
Scene 6

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
Four, five, six, nay, seven children--the Bayard women are blessed with fruitfulness. And we shall have a garden in the back where they may play, right where we stand. And over there...

[ Pointing]

we'll have a privet hedge to separate us from Father's yard. Such a generous spirit for giving us the land. You don't care for him. Never mind. Enough land to lay out our...

[ Looking at him shyly]

bed sheets and linen to dry in the sunshine, and yet some room for a little garden of healing herbs. Sage, rosemary, coriander, rue, and cyclamen-for love. You're not listening. Rip, do you hear me?

RIP VAN DAM
[ Peering at the sky]

Look, 'tis an eagle flying over the Hudson. See how it seems to stand in the sky.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
[ Looking up]

'Tis only an osprey.

RIP VAN DAM
An eagle.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
Am I your dove?

RIP VAN DAM
What?

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
Am I your dove? Adriaan Vanderspiegel calls Sarah his dove.

RIP VAN DAM
Tame barnyard fowl. I'd rather be an eagle, free to fly, to soar, to plunge, above men's dominion, catching his prey when he will, answerable to no one.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
They say they mate for life.

RIP VAN DAM
Damn! Must you put nice boundaries on this world? A garden here, a wall there, a father in that corner, a husband in this.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
What is our world but nature subdued, a struggle against anarchic riot? What is man but a beast constrained?

RIP VAN DAM
I would go West, where no man has trod. I grow tired of this parceling of my life: duty to my faith, bounds to family, bonds to you.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
These words on the eve of our marriage?

RIP VAN DAM
Forgive me, I rave. I did not mean to hurt you.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
You've been ill-humored since your encounter with that beastly Cornbury.

RIP VAN DAM
Since that meeting my sleep has been torn. My dreams follow me past the sentinel of light. They haunt my day.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
That man has bewitched you!

RIP VAN DAM
Cornbury is your garden run riot; as if some madman had strewn willy-nilly handfuls of warring seeds. Here roses nod to deadly nightshade, and nettles brush with lilies. There entwine the tulip and the weed. The tendrils of this garden have invaded my thoughts.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
An infusion of foxglove and hellebore clears a troubled mind.

RIP VAN DAM
Don't you find it queer that he treats both Jew and black African as intimates, does not disdain the savage, has no animus towards women, but seeks to improve their beauty, and in the martial arts has no equal? Don't you. find that queer?

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
Yes, yes, but still I wouldn't miss his Queen Anne celebration for all the world. Everyone will be there.

RIP VAN DAM
I shan't go.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
Oh, come, his apish tricks will lighten your heart. And if his humor palls, his magpie wife will amuse us in his stead.

RIP VAN DAM
No.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
My dearest Rip, your melancholy will soon depart. In our own nest, under festive quilts,-there riot takes its rightful course. You will teach me what all men know, and I shall submit to my sweet master.

RIP VAN DAM
You make my cheeks grow red.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
Silly man, you who would destroy all boundaries are scarce willing to mount the frail wall of my defense.

[ Pointing]

Look, Rip, there's a little spring, and a soft mossy glade. Shall we sit awhile?

RIP VAN DAM
'Tis time we returned. Your father will be out of sorts.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
I can soothe his ill temper. Come with me.

RIP VAN DAM
Nay.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
Let your Dutch stubbornness yield to a softer voice. Come. Kom met mij? Ja?

RIP VAN DAM
Nay.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
[ Leads him off.]

Yes?

RIP VAN DAM
Nay.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
[ Commandingly]

Yes.

Act 1, Scene 7
Scene 7

A chamber in the governor's mansion.

EDWARD, seated behind a Queen Anne desk in a man's claret-colored suit, is rereading a letter he has just completed. Halfway through the letter he rises and walks about the room.

EDWARD HYDE
"I declare my opinion to be, that all these colonies ought to be kept entirely dependent upon and subservient to England, and that can never be if they are suffered to go on in the notions they have; for the consequence will be that if once they can see they can care

for themselves, not only comfortably but handsomely, too, without the help of England, they who are already not very fond of submitting to government would soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harbored in their breasts.

( Enter his wife, MARIE, a woman of fashion wearing a large crucifix. She is of Irish and French extraction. She is a haunted, pale, fading beauty. She has a French accent. She comes in as silently as possible, but every time she moves there is a clank.)

EDWARD HYDE
This will not seem strange when you consider what sort of people this country is inhabited by."*

[ Like a psychic in a vaudeville show]

A silver cup, a teapot of fine porcelain make, a garnet brooch, and a pewter chamber pot. Perhaps a--

* "Lord Cornbury to Sec˙ Hodges," Documentary History of the State of New York.

MARIE HYDE
Édouard, pourquoi tu me persécutes? May I not go out for a little breath of air?

EDWARD HYDE
Marie, whom have we visited today?

MARIE HYDE
Madame de Lancey.

EDWARD HYDE
Then your harvest has been a poor one. Madame de Lancey is acquainted with your habits.

MARIE HYDE
Of what do you accuse your pauvre petite Marie?

EDWARD HYDE
Of a crime for which a more civilized country would chop off your hand.

[ He lifts MARIE' s skirt, revealing dangling household items and jewelry attached to her petticoat.]

MARIE HYDE
[ Bursting into tears]

You spoil everything. You have your little pleasures, and you allow your poor wife none.

EDWARD HYDE
I don't disdain your pleasures, ma chère, but for everything you attach yourself to I receive a bill, and those thieving Dutch charge thrice the value of the trifle.

MARIE HYDE
I can't help myself. What would you have me do? Oh, Édouard, mon cher, forced to leave Versailles at a

tender age--yes, yes, a virgin--

[EDWARD shrugs.]

--married to a man of such strange tastes, whose own father detests him and lives on only to deprive his son of his title and inheritance; attached against my will to a Protestant court; deprived of the solace of the true. faith;

[ She starts to detach the objects and place them on the floor after kissing them first. The stolen items are arranged before a curtain.]

--suffering the anguish of a mother who lost four children before a priest could be found to give them the sacrament of holy baptism; torn apart by the cabals of a foreign court; ordered to learn the barbaric English tongue; condemned to eat boiled food and sit on chairs of ungilded woods; to smile when I wanted to weep; to bend my knees to a monarch false --Dutch William--and to mask one's--how you say?-loyauté, allegiance, to true majesty, James Stuart; compelled to empty the chamber pots of an heretic princess--

EDWARD HYDE
My cousin, Queen Anne--

MARIE HYDE
--who exiled us in poverty to send us to the end of the world to do penance for your sins.

[ She rips open a curtain, behind which is an Italianate statue of the Holy Virgin. She throws herself on her knees before it and recites the "Hail, Mary" in French.]

Je Vous salue, Marie, pleine de grâce, le Seigneur est avec Vous....

EDWARD HYDE
[ Rips back the curtain.]

Marie! You go too far! Your extravagant professions of faith will undo us.

MARIE HYDE
[ Suddenly practical]

And your extravagant gowns must bring us to ruin. Oh, Édouard, I care not where your fancy leads and am indifferent to the fury your behavior provokes among the canaille, mais vraiment, mon mari, you play to an audience of one-moi.

EDWARD HYDE
Hélas, I would play to an audience of none. Does the rose bloom for the gardener? It blooms because it must; it blooms perhaps only for those who would see it. But my talents do not go unperceived. Only yesterday Margareta de Peyster begged my advice on the proper cut of her bodice.

MARIE HYDE
Prend garde, Édouard, that woman smiles with one cheek and spits with another. Listen carefully. When I

entered Madame de Lancey's chamber, unannounced as is my custom, she was reading a letter. She seemed most startled. Was it I, or was it something she was reading? My pulse quickened. Madame de Lancey with a billetdoux? A lover? Quelle folie! Pour un instant I was back at Versailles. Une intrigue charmante....

[ She produces the letter from her bosom.]

Voilà!

[ Hands it to EDWARD.]

EDWARD HYDE
It's in Dutch. I'll call Spinoza.

( He rings a bell. AFRICA enters as he rings. She catches sight of objects filched by MARIE.)

AFRICA
I see that her ladyship's been visiting.

MARIE HYDE
Salope!

AFRICA
[ Hexes MARIE with an arcane gesture.]

Dumbaya zamoosh!

EDWARD HYDE
[ Reading letter]

"Privy Council"?

MARIE HYDE
[ To AFRICA]

Merdeuse.

AFRICA
Lanash.

EDWARD HYDE
[ Shouting]

Spinoza!

(EDWARD goes to the door and opens it. SPINOZA falls in.)

SPINOZA DACOSTA
[ From the floor]

My lord?

EDWARD HYDE
[ Thrusting the letter to SPINOZA]

I pray you, render this in English.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
[ Places magnifying glass in front of letter]

"2 kegs of molasses

5 capons plucked

1 barrel of malt vinegar--"

EDWARD HYDE
The other side.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
"My dear Mistress de Lancey: The time grows short. It is imperative that action be taken, especially after young van Dam's encounter with the Beast. Pastor van Dam swears that a strange fever has seized his son, causing him to leave his parents' house and breaking the heart of his intended bride."

EDWARD HYDE
[ Smiling]

Hmm.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
"If our men are too cowardly to tread the righteous

path, we women must undertake the journey. We must cleanse the temple of abomination. It is our duty to persuade our husbands to rise up against this evil tyrant and his Popish wife." Must I continue this slander, your lordship?

AFRICA
In my country we know how to treat such people.

MARIE HYDE
[ Disappointed]

I thought it was a love letter.

EDWARD HYDE
Pray continue.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
"I understand your fears on embarking on this perilous journey. Your husband may lack understanding, but from what I've heard you will have the support of that strong young footman Dirk to console you."

MARIE HYDE
I told you it was about I'amour.

EDWARD HYDE
Hush.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
"Therefore, do your utmost to convince your husband to support our cause. The next English boat will bring us authority from Her Majesty's own Privy Council. Down with Cornbury! Yours in God's wrath, Margareta de Peyster." There's a postscript. "Act now or ruin your marriage."

MARIE HYDE
I shall poison the de Peyster bitch!

AFRICA
[ Taking out snakeskin bag]

I have just the thing.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
God of our father! That Jezebel!

AFRICA
Three drops in her chocolate...

MARIE HYDE
[ Taking out a vial]

Two drops of this... Une morte affreuse.

EDWARD HYDE
Ladies, ladies, your loyalty is admirable, but to take arms against this woman would be like swatting a fly with a cannon. Dear Margareta, I thought your warmth was true affection. Hélas, once again those in high position suffer the spleen and envy of their lessers.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Your charity is commendable, but do not dismiss Mistress de Peyster so lightly. She will stop at nothing to bring about your ruin. I beg you to take measures in keeping with your office to defend yourself. Take the advice of a survivor of a persecuted race. Curb your extravagances, pay off some of your debtors--a mere token --and, above all, cease your--how shall I say it?--your public demonstration of your similarity to the Queen.

EDWARD HYDE
Postpone the Queen Anne Birthday Ball? Never!

MARIE HYDE
But, Édouard--

AFRICA
When the bees are angry even the hippopotamus lowers his head.

EDWARD HYDE
Never! The Queen's governor shall not bow to this Dutch rabble. Besides, it's too late. I've written an entertainment and rehearsed the actors. And I've already sold South Jersey to pay for my robes. You should see them.

[ Transfixed]

Exquisite... pearl-white satin, with a mass of silver lace, the shoulders covered, and the neckline square. The sleeves are narrow down to the elbows, with wide flounces of lace mixed with point-de-Venise.

[ The stage darkens as the description continues and the overture to the New World Masque is heard.]

The underskirt is mounted on iron hoops, very wide at the hem. I shall wear a sprig of...

Act 1, Scene 8
Scene 8

The banquet room of the governor's mansion.

It is the night of the Queen Anne Birthday Ball. During the interval between this and the preceding scene a curtain is lowered. It is decorated with a painted portrait of Queen Anne, which bears a strange resemblance to Edward. During the musical overture we hear the sound of last-minute hammerings and such cries, in a thick Irish brogue, as, "Watch out, it's falling! Get out of the way," followed by a huge crash. We hear EDWARD crying, "I never want to see your face again!" etc˙ The following New World Masque is performed with enormous but amateurish enthusiasm. The music is in the style of Handel.

NARRATOR
[ In front of curtain. He is wearing English court costume.]

In honor of Her Majesty the Queen
His excellence Lord Cornb'ry's set this scene

To celebrate our Lady's day pi birth
And bring to you a little joy and mirth.

On New York town the Muses do descend;
We pray our humble play doth not offend.
It pleases usthat we please you
By music fair to hear and verses true.

Begin we then anon a New World Masque-
And if we stumble your pardon we do ask.

( A flourish as the curtain rises. We hear the sound of tomtoms. MUNSEE, wearing a loincloth and feathers, stands center stage posed like a cigar store Indian.)

The red man garbed in Nature's naked glory
Does make a mete commencement for our story.

(MUNSEE dances standard Indian war dance.)

He lived in peace and followed his own way
Until the white man brought another day.

( Enter a SPANISH SOLDIER dressed like De Soto.)

From Catholic Spain came soldiers bold
To save red souls--and steal their gold.

( The SPANIARD does a fifteen-second flamenco dance that ends with an attack on MUNSEE . Enter a Frans Hals DUTCHMAN wearing wooden shoes.)

From brave Netherlands tradesmen did arrive
And with the red men did hard bargains drive.

(DUTCHMAN does a clog dance that ends with an attack on MUNSEE )

And soon to work, to toil, it seemed fitting, In chains they brought the blacks to do their bidding.

( Enter AFRICA dressed by Bendel's slave boutique. She does a specialty number that clearly upstages all previous efforts.

AFRICA' s dance is followed by a brief quadrille that disintegrates into a shoving match. The music, at first harmonious, grows dissonant. Over the music the NARRATOR continues.)

It's not man's wont to live in harmony;
The sound of arms makes clear our destiny.
The first to die were red men proud,
Their help rewarded by a Christian shroud.

( The SPANIARD kills MUNSEE and quickly makes the sign of the cross over him. MUNSEE, drafted as an actor, refuses to die easily.)

The next to die in New World anarchy
Were white men caught by clash of monarchy.

( The DUTCHMAN and the SPANIARD fight to music. AFRICA "languishes." Before they murder each other there is a fanfare. They fall to their knees.)

All seemed ruined in this new land
Until Britannia's firm and justly hand
Subdued her foes and ended wasteful strife,
And brought to all a new and better life.

( Another and greater fanfare. Enter EDWARD dressed in the gown he described at the end of the preceding scene. This is his finest costume. He carries an orb and scepter. The NARRATOR addresses EDWARD.)

Anna, royal mistress of our hearts,
Defender of the faith and all these parts,
We celebrate your birth with pomp and joy--

( Enter MARGARETA from audience. She points a pistol at EDWARD.)

MARGARETA
Arrest that man!

( Music stops.)

EDWARD HYDE
By whose authority do you dare interrupt the Queen's celebration?

MARGARETA
[ Brandishing a document]

By order of the Privy Council of Her Majesty and the Civil Court of the colony of New York, which order your arrest on the grounds of dissolute indebtedness. Cornbury, you have defaulted on your last loan!

EDWARD HYDE
Madam, you cannot arrest the Queen's governor.

MARGARETA
Sir, it is in her name that we are arresting you.

EDWARD HYDE
I am her cousin, madam--and besides, I haven't sung yet.

[ He starts singing and the shocked ORCHESTRA starts up, at first feebly then with great force. He sings a florid Handelian aria in falsetto.)

Gracious Queen, thy name resounds
O'er the starry firmament.
Sing, ye flutes, and, trumpets, sound,
Pluck, ye harps, to ornament.
Aquarian-guided Monarch, you,
'Tis with--

( The ACTORS desert EDWARD. MARGARETA approaches as TWO SOLDIERS enter from the wings. They drag EDWARD off singing and screaming as the lights go down. The last note we hear from EDWARD is a high one.)

CURTAIN

Act 2
Act 2, Scene 1
ACT II

Scene 1

Debtors' prison. A room with one barred window and a door. It is dimly lit.

EDWARD, MARIE, and AFRICA have been arrested and are suffering from three weeks of incarceration. AFRICA is asleep, in the throes of a nightmare. Sporadically she mumbles incoherently. MARIE is reading Les Fables of La Fontaine before she retires for the long night. EDWARD paces. He is dressed in dull male attire.

MARIE HYDE
The candle burns low. I have no light to read.

EDWARD HYDE
I should think you know that book by heart.

MARIE HYDE
Ah, quelle grande consolation. Your English writers have written nothing so sage as La Fontaine. When the mob carried off all our books I only saved my fables.

[ Closing the book. With a sigh]

" Je pile et ne romps pas."

EDWARD HYDE
Which you hid under your skirt. Tis a pity you did not look to your jewels as well.

MARIE HYDE
I did, but they violated me and took them. But their greed made them overlook this book. This volume was given to me by Madame de Sévigné.

EDWARD HYDE
That tale again.

MARIE HYDE
[ Ignoring EDWARD]

If she knew that her gift and her petite Marie would end their life's journey in prison--

EDWARD HYDE
Not prison, Marie. We must look on this place of confinement as a sanctuary from debt.

MARIE HYDE
Sanctuaire? No light to read, bed of straw--

EDWARD HYDE
Stripped of my office, I am vulnerable, ma chère. Here we must wait until my ancient father finally dies. Then we can be free to leave this--

MARIE HYDE
No wine with meals, never allowed to leave to pay my little calls--

EDWARD HYDE
To leave and go where? I have nothing fit to put on. Not even a simple robe de chambre or a lace cap--

MARIE HYDE
No cards to play at whist of an evening--

EDWARD HYDE
Or even ombre, or basset. You are right, Marie! It is impossible here! Intolerable!

[ Runs to the door and shouts.]

Atticus! Atticus!

( A lout of thirty-five enters.)

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
Mister Rockefeller to your lordship.

EDWARD HYDE
Mister Rockefeller, may we have some more candles? It is oppressively dark in here.

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
Who's to pay for them?

EDWARD HYDE
The Civil Court.

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
You can't get anything out of them. I don't run no palace for gentlefolk here. You'll get nothing from me. No pretty games at night for you, the devil's games of cards, and the reading of Popish tracts. Honest folk go to bed when the dark comes.

EDWARD HYDE
You, sir, are impertinent, and your speech and breath are vile.

MARIE HYDE
Dog of a jailer! Animal! Mon Dieu, if the eighteenth century begins this way for people of quality, how will it end?

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
People of quality, my arse. In this land a humble Rockefeller is a whole lot better than a loony frog-woman and a man that likes to wear skirts instead of gettin' under 'em.

EDWARD HYDE
I represent Her Majesty the Queen, you lout.

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
From what I hear about her you look a whole lot better in 'em than she.

EDWARD HYDE
That is treason. Rockefeller, beware.

MARIE HYDE
The cur is right. She was grotesque when I last saw her--covered with stinking bandages.

EDWARD HYDE
Go back to your reading, madam. I will hear no slurs on my cousin.

MARIE HYDE
[ Blowing out candle]

I'll save what's left for another night. After all, I know what happens in "The, Ant and the Grasshopper."

[ Closes book and reclines on a straw pallet.]

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
[ Whispering to EDWARD]

Milord, please to come here.

EDWARD HYDE
What is it, Rockefeller?

[ Approaches the JAILER.]

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
Closer, your lordship.

EDWARD HYDE
Faugh, sir, you stink of rum.

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
It keeps me warm. Here, your lordship, take your hand and feel this.

[ Places EDWARD' s hand on his crotch.]

I know you like this kind of meat. Big enough?

EDWARD HYDE
On the contrary.

[ He withdraws his hand.]

Go fuck a beaver.

[ He turns away.]

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
You'll come a-begging!

EDWARD HYDE
I doubt it.

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
Pervert!

(ATTICUS exits. The lights dim further. In the near-darkness EDWARD turns his back to the audience.

A beat of silence, then an arpeggio on a harpsichord. Enter QUEEN ANNE on a wheelchair. With one gouty leg up, she is swathed in bandages. She wears a crown. She is ill, fat, and ugly.)

QUEEN ANNE
EDWARD.

( He turns.)

EDWARD HYDE
Your Majesty!

QUEEN ANNE
Be not so formal, I pray, but let us use the names we called each other as children. I was Ziphares and--

EDWARD HYDE
And I was Semandra.

QUEEN ANNE
Poor Semandra.

EDWARD HYDE
Poor Ziphares.

QUEEN ANNE
Approach, Semandra.

[EDWARD approaches.]

I know that most cannot stand the smell, but I'm so lonely.

[EDWARD kneels at her feet. She pats his head.]

I was always ill-starred, but you, Semandra, were to be the center of passions.

EDWARD HYDE
No, Ziphares, I only reflected your glory. How they love you, your people.

QUEEN ANNE
Today. And in the next ballad they wish me dead and call for Hanover to reign.... But we did have some silver days. Remember when I loved Sarah, my Mrs˙ Freeman, and you were William's pet.

EDWARD HYDE
Do you remember when you fled London to join your sister?

QUEEN ANNE
And you left my father's side to run off with Churchill? Oh, those were exciting times. I could walk then.

EDWARD HYDE
And dance and hunt. We hunted hares at Winchester, remember?

QUEEN ANNE
Where to amuse ourselves we exchanged clothes. Was that the beginning of your extravagant folly? Though the Lord knows you never harmed a soul by it.

EDWARD HYDE
I thought I looked good in them. In a world of such treachery and madness, it's hardly worth dwelling on it.... Was it that rainy summer we sang together?

QUEEN ANNE
Yes, Semandra, we did sing together. How did it go?

EDWARD HYDE
We wrote it together.

[ He sings.]

Rose, rose, rose, dear rose--

QUEEN ANNE
Ah, yes.

EDWARD AND ANNE
Will your petals turn to red? or shall winter leave you dead?

EDWARD HYDE
Ziphares waits thy sweet return-For spring Semandra's heart doth yearn.

EDWARD AND ANNE
Rose, rose, rose, dear rose.

( The light gradually dims. The singing overlaps the raucous beginning to the following scene.)

Act 2, Scene 2
Scene 2

A chamber in the governor's mansion.

A trio of WOMEN dressed in black noisily devastate the belongings of Lord Cornbury. Apart from her friends, MARGARETA sits at EDWARD' s desk perusing documents.

HESTER DE LANCEY
[ Viciously tearing off a dress draped over the shoulders of SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL]

YOU bitch! 'Tis a color that suits me, not your red, pocked face.

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
Your great udders would rip it at the seams.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
[ Trying on a hat]

How think you it suits me?

HESTER DE LANCEY
Like a riband on a prize sow.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
Slut!

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
Give it back, Hester!

HESTER DE LANCEY
Nay!

(HESTER and SARAH play tug of war and rip the garment in two. They fall to the floor laughing. ANNA MARIA opens the curtain, revealing MARIE' s Virgin. She decks the Virgin in EDWARD' s clothing as SARAH and HESTER fight.)

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
Foul wind!

HESTER DE LANCEY
Foul box!

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
[ Drinking from a crystal decanter and toasting a portrait of Queen Anne]

Grossest box, they say! God save the Queen!

(HESTER and SARAH crawl to gain possession of the decanter.)

HESTER DE LANCEY
[ To ANNA MARIA]

Quaff me, sister. I dearly love porto.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
So no one can deny.

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
[ Grabbing the decanter]

To the Queen's governor! May he rot in prison forever!

MARGARETA
[ Aside]

Forever is not long enough.

(HESTER, SARAH, and ANNA MARIA rush behind the screen. A kind of fashion show ensues, in which the three WOMEN, dressed in various costumes of EDWARD, act out the major events in his rise to power. As the WOMEN become more wanton, they become more beautiful.)

HESTER DE LANCEY
[ Appearing first]

"'Tis a little thing I wore to please Lord Churchill."

[ She exits behind screen.]

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
"Whose eye once caught and heart once gained passed me on to... "

[ She exits behind screen.]

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
"His lord high bugger, Bentinck, called Little Hans in Holland, known in England as Big Henry."

[ She exits behind screen.]

HESTER DE LANCEY
[ In a new costume]

"His Grace, the Duke of Portland, who, enflamed by my... "

[ Slaps her ass.]

"‘charms,’ gave me entrée to... "

[ She exits.]

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
[ In a new costume]

"Our own Dutch William."

[ She curtsies, presenting her ass to the audience. She lifts up her skirts. Behind the screen someone makes the sound of a fart, ANNA MARIA straightens, faces the audience, and says with great seriousness:]

"God bless the House of Orange."

[ Exits.]

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
[ In a new costume]

"King William, in gratitude for such loyal service, gave me as reward...

[ Enter ANNA MARIA and HESTER]

the governship of those rich lands beyond the sea, our own New York and Jer-sey."

( As MARGARETA applauds, ANNA MARIA, HESTER, and SARAH attempt a curtain call.)

MARGARETA
Well done, women. Your ribald games would amuse even our deposed governor. Cornbury would smile at such a recounting of his rise to power. 'Twould lighten his otherwise tedious hours in prison.

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
It cannot be denied that his lordship had the best wardrobe in the colony. In matters of taste he was supreme arbiter. Once he told me, "Sarah, you have a swan's neck. Show it, show it! Let your head rise from a sea of lace!"

HESTER DE LANCEY
He admired only your neck, but most positively fell in love with my ear. Once at the governor's mansion he toasted me, saying, "Madame de Lancey's right lobe has no equal. Like the beauty of Helen, it would kindle another Trojan War."

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
How can you be grateful to the conceits of a madman? If he told you your droppings were precious stones, would you display them?

HESTER DE LANCEY
How now, Anna Maria? There is always a little truth in madness.

[ Fondling her ear]

Surely if Cornbury had admired some part of you--

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
I care not for his grotesque flattery. Like an evil demon he has robbed my womb of its promised harvest. He has placed a blight upon my wedding and widowed me before my time.

HESTER DE LANCEY
Rip lies in no churchyard. Even yesterday my footman encountered him in Molly's Tavern--sure, that place is hell's own cauldron--and Master Rip seemed filled with life, loudly railing against his father's constraints.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
[ In tears]

How seemed he, my poor Rip?

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
[ Comforting ANNA MARIA]

Hush, Hester, his soul is forever damned. The abandonment of a virgin is no cause for amusement.

[ To ANNA MARIA]

You shall be avenged. Cornbury and his popish wife and haughty slave--

HESTER DE LANCEY
They say she's a princess!

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
She's a black witch. When Cornbury's gone, I'll teach her other ways. That strong back shall pull a plow, and she shall be mated like any other animal to increase my herd.

HESTER DE LANCEY
And his wife shall garner the punishments to which she has been so far immune. The Frenchwoman shall be branded a thief and cast out into the wilderness.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
That's not punishment enough! Lady Cornbury is a whore married to a whore!

MARGARETA
[ Stand's.]

No worse, no better, ladies, as we should know, who sell our virtue for even less.

HESTER DE LANCEY
Indeed?

MARGARETA
Was it for Master de Lancey's fierce ardor that you accepted him as a husband? Do you dream of your husband when you lie with his footman?

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
[ Putting a protective arm about the affronted HESTER]

You who have no man and whom no man has wanted have not the right to judge.

MARGARETA
Sarah, my dearest child, my knowledge is hard come by.

[ She sits on edge of desk.]

I have not been immune to Cupid's darts, but rather than be the mother of a stinking, sucking brood, seven surviving of twenty painful births, I am the blessed, barren mother of none, husband of my husband, mistress of myself. My girl, even with a man, children, wealth, you envy the trappings of a lunatic.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
And you envy his power.

MARGARETA
[ Standing]

To come and go as he pleases; to couple with whom he chooses, sticking his rod into mate, master, or mistress; to own his family name, obliterating his wife's; to rise and fall according to his own endeavor, oblivious to the efforts of his spouse. Hypocrite! Of course I envy Cornbury's power!

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
[ Conciliatory]

Margareta, you confuse us.

ANNA MARIE BAYARD
You own van Cortlandt land in your own right.

HESTER DE LANCEY
And you come and go when you please.

SARAH VANDERSPIEGEL
Even our husbands will agree that you brought down the tyrant. What further can a woman wish for?

MARGARETA
[ Relaxing in chair behind desk]

I wish to be the governor. After all, ladies, it's no more outrageous than our governor wanting to be the Queen.

( The WOMEN titter. Their laughter is electronically amplified as the lights go down. The sound is like the laughter

of Klytemnestra and her servants in the Birgit Nilsson recording of Strauss's Elektra. This scene overlaps the next one.)

Act 2, Scene 3
Scene 3

Debtors' prison.

In the darkness the laughter ebbs. The lights come up, revealing AFRICA recounting a tale to EDWARD and MARIE. Brilliant sunshine streams through the barred window, illuminating AFRICA.

AFRICA
As we left the village the last sound I heard was the laughter of the village maidens. I was only twelve....

MARIE HYDE
Go on, ma chère. You entrance us.

AFRICA
I was happy and frightened--happy because the kundala-baku-* were over, the purification rites for a virgin princess. I was frightened because I was leaving home for the first time....

* "Kundala-baku" is to be followed by Bantu "clicking" sounds.

MARIE HYDE
A sentiment I know well.

AFRICA
I was going to the kingdom of my future husband, whom I had never seen. The women had assured me that he was both handsome and brave.

MARIE HYDE
I had no such hopes

[ Pointedly looking at EDWARD]

--myself.

EDWARD HYDE
Tais-toi, Marie, je voudrais entendre cette histoire fantastique.

AFRICA
As they bore me through the forest on a palanquin, I could hear the songs of myriad birds.

[ Whistles a lovely but excruciatingly difficult bird call.]

They blended with the ever more distant sounds of the village drums. My fears gave way to imaginings as the land grew foreign. Although the old women had told me what were to be my duties as first wife of a great prince, I was without

experience. How would his mother greet me? What would he look like? What would it feel like?

As thus I mused I heard cries of outrage and wailing from the front of the cortège. A slave had stumbled and dropped a tray bearing ceremonial yam cakes, among our people an ill omen. My lady-in-waiting bade me drive it from my mind, for surely would the gods protect me. ... And surely she was wrong.

For upon arrival at the great river--as grand as the Hudson--we were set upon by Arab traders. Men whom I had seen smiling at my father's court now turned their angry faces toward me. My slaves fled in terror. In vain I cried in protest; I was now a slave myself.

EDWARD HYDE
Poor princess.

MARIE HYDE
Pauvre princesse.

AFRICA
Princess no more, nor bride, nor daughter. I was only a frightened girl enslaved to men who dealt in flesh.

[ She shudders.]

The gods have mercifully released me from the memory of the deathly caravan that bore me through the desert to Tangiers. My station recognized, I was destined to be the newest acquisition of Ahmed, the Bey of Tangiers.

My shackles were removed, and I was stripped, bathed, and anointed with precious balms. The spiteful eunuchs brought me to the chambers of their master. I had not long to wait for what they had prepared me....

[ Reliving the moment]

He stood before me, handsome were it not for the malevolence of his eyes. He put his fingers on my lips... my throat... my nipples... my-between my thighs. He turned me round....

[AFRICA closes her eyes.]

EDWARD HYDE
Don't stop!

MARIE HYDE
Continue!

AFRICA
[ Opening her eyes. They are wide with horror.]

I looked up. Suddenly we were not alone. Guttural sounds escaped from the Bey's contorted mouth as he was garroted by two great men. It was horrible! Months later I was to learn that Ahmed Bey was o'erthrown by a younger brother. Such is the custom of those people.

His brother, having little taste for women, gave me as a gift to a merchant with whom he wished to ingratiate himself.

(EDWARD and MARIE sigh.)

Served up again, and this time to a man sickly pale to my unaccustomed eyes, I was given to a stern follower of the crucified god. After drenching me with water, he mumbled some words and set me to work in his kitchen. Mercifully, Hendrik van Loon had no interest in either sex. At night he counted his gold and left me alone. The airs of my continent are not kind to people of your race. Mijnheer van Loon soon expired of a fever....

[ She smiles.]

I found myself on a great ship, a girl of fourteen alone with forty sailors.

EDWARD HYDE
And a virgin still?

AFRICA
A virgin still... I was the captain's choice.... Bound hand and foot--

EDWARD HYDE
Yes?

AFRICA
Pinioned to his bed--

MARIE HYDE
GO on.

AFRICA
Screaming for mercy till they gagged me, I knew this time no gods would intervene. Closer came the captain, the unfamiliar odor of his race assailing my nostrils. He placed his dirty paw under my torn chemise and hoarsely whispered--

( Enter ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER, leading RIP, SPINOZA, AND MUNSEE-all in chains.)

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
There's room for more in here! 'Tis not been filled up yet!

[ Exit.]

EDWARD HYDE
Visitors! My friends have come to visit. How thoughtful. Welcome to our quarters. Our dearest Africa was just relating the story of her perilous life.

MARIE HYDE
Cher Maître Spinoza, did you bring some new books?

SPINOZA DACOSTA
No, my lady. Ruffians descended on us and dragged us here. My lord, we come not as guests.

(MUNSEE faints.)

MUNSEE
Ah!

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Look to my brother Zev!

AFRICA
He's bleeding! I shall bind his wounds.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Zev fought like Samson 'gainst the Philistines when the soldiers led by vengeful Margareta de Peyster came to arrest us at my home.

EDWARD HYDE
What now? Her wrath lies heavy even on my friends. My dear Spinoza, I am truly sorry that your loyalty to me has brought about your downfall.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Precipitous change is my people's lot.

[ Bows deeply to MARIE, who nods.]

I was instructing Munsee in the oral tradition of my people.

EDWARD HYDE
How now, sir?

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Today being Saturday, Leah, my good wife, was about to serve our humble Sabbath meal.

MARIE HYDE
Speak not of food, je vous en prie.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
I was speaking to our brother Munsee about the faith of the Hebrews, bantering the mysteries of God's creation.

(EDWARD looks relieved.)

MUNSEE
[ Coming out of his swoon]

Was it not Rabbi ben Ezra who said in his commentary to the Babylonian Talmud--?

AFRICA
Speak not, brave warrior. Conserve your strength.

MUNSEE
[ Looking at AFRICA]

Whinne. Beautiful woman. I am in that paradise my fathers spoke of, where dead heroes are cradled by maidens.

AFRICA
Alas, sir, this is not your paradise but prison, and I fear for our well-being.

EDWARD HYDE
[ Finally notices RIP.]

Rip! Rip van Dam! Alas, we never did dance that gavotte. What brings you to this sad place?

RIP VAN DAM
May I have a word with you alone, my lord?

EDWARD HYDE
Of course, my young sir.

[ He turns to the GROUP.]

I command you not to listen.

[ They all stop up their ears and turn their backs. The lights dim except onRIPand EDWARD Gradually during the following conversation the others flagrantly eavesdrop, EDWARD gushes.]

I must seem a sorry sight to you. As you can see, they allowed me to bring nothing--not even a fan, a handkerchief, my healing lotions, my honey water--excuse me, sir, I rush on.

RIP VAN DAM
You are in grave peril, my lord.

EDWARD HYDE
[ Ignoring RIP]

They could have let me pack a portmanteau. How kind of you to visit me. I perceived you were different from the others the very moment we met. There was something finer in your carriage, although your breeding--

RIP VAN DAM
There are plots against your person, my lord.

EDWARD HYDE
Why talk about plots? We have so little time. Has no one ever told you that your eyes counterfeit lapus lazuli flecked with gold. Queen Mary had such a precious stone. She would have liked you, Rip. She was fond of Dutchmen and once told me--

RIP VAN DAM
They will kill you, my lord!

EDWARD HYDE
[ Dismissing even this]

My life has been threatened in several capitals. My dear Rip, this day was to be as sad as the rest, cheerless and empty, void, nil, null. But I feel much improved.

[ He takes RIP' s hands.]

But what is this? Shackles?

RIP VAN DAM
Yes, my lord.

EDWARD HYDE
Insufferable! How dare they?

RIP VAN DAM
They are capable of much more, sir. They intend--

EDWARD HYDE
Those scoundrels will forfeit their lives when I send--

MARIE HYDE
Idiot, let the boy speak!

EDWARD HYDE
I have always followed the counsels of my immediate impressions. Speak.

RIP VAN DAM
'Tis with difficulty that my lips form these words.... We Dutch are a brooding lot, given more to venting our spleen than showing our affections.

EDWARD HYDE
[ Quizzical]

Indeed?

RIP VAN DAM
You know that my father is a pastor. The living presence of hell is ever with me.

[ Reliving the event]

Once as a boy--it was midwinter--the pond at Lispenard Meadows had frozen over. I was skating at dusk--alone. I had always been an indifferent skater, but that late afternoon--was it the early sunset? was it the clarity of the air? or the stillness broken only by the sound of my skating?--

MARIE HYDE
[ Aside]

I hate Dutch landscapes.

RIP VAN DAM
I only remember skating with remarkable ease, pirouetting, twirling, jumping. In this state my face must have been suffused with the joy of accomplishments, for such must have been its expression when my father sprang at me. He had come himself to fetch me home for dinner, and had been watching me unawares. He said, "Such exuberance is ungodly. There is no joy on earth, except in serving God!" And then he struck me down.

AFRICA
[ Aside]

The Pastor's zeal is well known to every serving girl in town.

EDWARD HYDE
Cruel father.

RIP VAN DAM
Cruel shepherd, cruel flock. As my father did strike me down, so will his people strike at you. They hate you not so much for your corruption as for the prodigality of your nature, the lavish abundance of your spirit. Your very being is a provocation to them.

EDWARD HYDE
At the Court of Saint James, my behavior was the cause of no alarms.

RIP VAN DAM
'Tis not the whole cloth, my lord. There are some, and no small number, who, like me, admire your courageous heart. These people, for the most part of low estate, detest the sanctions imposed upon their liberty in the name of God.

EDWARD HYDE
Have they closed Moll's?

RIP VAN DAM
All public entertainments have been forbidden. Even the almshouse that you had erected has been shut. The poor, huddled in the streets, talk of your administration as a golden age. The Jews, my lord, whom you so magnanimously tolerated, are in danger.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
[ Aside]

And I told Leah it couldn't happen here.

RIP VAN DAM
Thus did I form a party, a rabble called by some, of like-minded youths drawn from every station, to thwart the designs of the van Cortlandt faction. Unhappily, we failed, betrayed by a nephew of Margareta de Peyster, who now rules this unfortunate city.

(RIP, in despair, buries his head in his arms. EDWARD, fatherly, comforts him.)

EDWARD HYDE
We are touched.

RIP VAN DAM
YOU must flee, sir. They will murder you.

EDWARD HYDE
I am cousin to the Queen. They wouldn't dare.

( With the following words the lights change, and the others assail EDWARD with their advice. Overlapping)

MARIE HYDE
So said Mary, Queen of Scots.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
So said Charles the First.

AFRICA
So said the Bey of Tangiers.

MUNSEE
We must flee.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
He's right.

AFRICA
For sure.

EDWARD HYDE
I'm too old to flee.

RIP VAN DAM
You must.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
I agree with Master van Dam. I fear we all are in danger and must take leave.

MUNSEE
With haste.

EDWARD HYDE
I hate being rushed.

( While the others were trying to convince EDWARD to flee, MARIE has walked to the cell door. She has primped and now is hiking up her skirts.)

MARIE HYDE
Oh, Monsieur Rockefeller, Monsieur Rockefeller!

EDWARD HYDE
What are you doing? Are you mad?

AFRICA
[ To EDWARD]

Hush now, that lady knows what she's about.

[ Sidles up to MARIE.]

Sir, sir, my lady has the vapors!

( Enter ROCKEFELLER, drunk.)

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
What's that? Nothing but complaints from that loony.

MARIE HYDE
Cher monsieur, my bodice is too tight. I swoon!

( She falls into AFRICA' s arms, revealing her charms. Those charms she doesn't, AFRICA does.)

AFRICA
You must help my poor mistress. You're so strong and you're the only man here.

ATTICUS ROCKEFELLER
[ Aroused]

You think so?

MARIE HYDE
[ Faintly]

Only you can do it.

[ Pointing to her breasts]

Here, here.

(ATTICUS thrusts his arms through the bars. They are immediately grasped by MARIE and AFRICA. MUNSEE rabbit-punches him into unconsciousness. With dexterity MARIE emerges from the heap with a key ring.)

MARIE HYDE
So much for endless discussion, Edouard, move it!

( The entire GROUP waits for MARIE to open the jail door. In line they join hands and start to leave. EDWARD is the last. It looks like the escape from The Road to Zanzibar. Enter MARGARETA and PASTOR VAN DAM.)

MARGARETA
Stop where you are!

[ The CORNBURY PARTY smile and continue on their way.]

I assure you, good people, it's not the hour for a stroll. My musketmen who wait outside are quick-tempered and unruly.

( The CORNBURY PARTY look to EDWARD for leadership. With a gesture that starts with "masculine" defiance and ends with "feminine" boredom, EDWARD turns around)

EDWARD HYDE
I really wasn't dressed for walking.

[ The others silently seat themselves, defeated.]

Madam, we deem it an honor that you visit us in our sordid lodgings. Pray, can we be of service?

MARGARETA
On the contrary, sir, we come to be of service to you.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
The fires of hell are waiting for you!

EDWARD HYDE
[ Ignoring the PASTOR]

How so, madam?

MARGARETA
The foment that you have inspired in our young has enraged the public conscience. The town raves openly against you, declaring your presence a pollution. We have tried to calm them, but to no avail. They call for your head.

RIP VAN DAM
[ To PASTOR]

Father, are you party to these lies?

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
You are no longer my son, sodomite!

MARGARETA
Therefore, for your own safety we have arranged for your removal to more secure quarters in Harlem.

EDWARD HYDE
Where at your leave it can be said that I was taken with a fever and so expired, or found at the foot of a stairwell, my neck broken. You will say the former governor was too fond of his port. Or perhaps I might die suddenly of apoplexy after a gluttonous meal of oysters.

MARGARETA
Surely you have more trust in me.

MARIE HYDE
Ma foi, does one trust a viper?

EDWARD HYDE
We would rather not be removed to Harlem. We have grown fond of these four walls. It was only yesterday that I remarked to my wife that fresh paint and gay hangings would make this place tolerable.

MARIE HYDE
[ To MARGARETA]

Baise mon cul royal catholique français! You have no manners, no heart, no... I pity you.

( Beat.)

MARGARETA
Candlestick wife! You have been driven mad for lack of a man. You pity me?

MARIE HYDE
On our wedding night Edouard took me five times. His conjugal attentions were more than any woman could demand.

MARGARETA
And the fruit of his endeavors, your children?

MARIE HYDE
[ Counting on her fingers]

The two oldest are with their grandfather in London, big English gargons like their papa.

EDWARD HYDE
[ Embarrassed]

Oh, Marie.

MARIE HYDE
And Charles, James, and Henrietta are with my family at Versailles. And no candlestick has fathered this new life I feel.

[ She pats her belly. AFRICA shrugs.]

MARGARETA
If this be true, six times have you cuckolded your... husband.

(EDWARD steps between the two women and takes center stage.)

EDWARD HYDE
It is ignominious to defend ourselves with children. So New World. However useful they may be to populate an empty land, in our world they serve mainly to perpetuate a noble line.

Children. The oldest awaits his father's death with a smile, the younger would gladly see the elder in the grave. And the father bitterly measures his years by the height of his offspring. Children are no proof of manhood.

[ He is playing for time, desperately looking for a chance to escape.]

What makes a man? Strength? Naked I would wrestle a bear. I assure you the victor's wreath would be mine. Horsemanship? My seat and endurance caught the eye of even the Spanish ambassador, that master of the horse, Juan Gonzaga Baltasár Carlos María de Santiago Olivares y López. The hunt? One autumn for the pleasure of His Majesty I slew a herd of wild boar. But I've since grown weary of blood and waste. La chasse is no proof of manhood. The arts of war? At the battle of the Boyne, Mars himself would have left the couch of Venus to see me worship at his gory altar. Love? A healthy appetite follows no regimen. Here a plum, there a joint of venison, here a melon, there a piquant sauce. Even you, Margareta--don't deny it--could have had a place on my menu.

[ He approaches MARGARETA.]

MARGARETA
Stand back, Cornbury.

EDWARD HYDE
Why do you loathe me? I have only admired you. The sharpness of your mind, the hunger of your curiosity, encouraged me to believe that you were the unkindled soul that I was to set aflame with the spark of civilization.

MARGARETA
Torch? Soul? Civilization? You are a lunatic. We gossiped. I was confidante to what secrets you cared to share. Oh, yes, I was rewarded by a peacock fan one month, a ruby ring another, and even a fine nightdress that you grew tired of. I listened well, and sometimes knew enough to make you laugh. You like to laugh.

In the course of our time together, sipping the chocolate you so dearly love, I became privy to a world I knew not of. How else could Margareta van Cortlandt of rude New York come to meet the great French monarch, to learn of our English majesties?

You were my tutor, my guide. You taught me that the powerful answer to none, even God, and are prepared to change allegiance--even their holy faith--as quick as the wind.

Is that what you call civilization?

EDWARD HYDE
The frailties of the mighty are sound lessons for your own advancement, dear Madam Governor Elect. In those quiet winter afternoons we spent closeted together you sipped chocolate with Civilization. You talked with Her yourself.

[ Takes center stage.]

I am Civilization! I am the vessel of the manners that you do not have. I am the ultimate arbiter of taste whether it be the hue of a ribbon or the facade of a palace. Did you know I have plans for a tiny summer palace in the Hamptons? Civilization is the nurturing breath of goodwill. I embrace everyone.

[ Everyone backs away in horror.]

In my arms there is room for Jews--a thousand years of fiscal experience. Room for the daughters of Ham--handmaidens of the lively arts. Never cease your seductive melodies. And as for the Red Man, that powerful body needs no raison d'être. Would you, Margareta de Peyster, destroy civilization, usurp my governorship, bestowed on me by the Queen, whose power comes from God?

MARGARETA
Insane hypocrite, your birth is so high that all people beneath you seem the same. If I could be your intimate, so could a black princess, a cultivated Jew, and even a savage.

PASTOR CORNELIUS VAN DAM
Cast out these devils!

MARGARETA
[ Delivering an election speech]

Do they know the price of a dry summer? Do they cultivate a frozen ground? Do they fear being flayed alive by heathen devils? To the highborn we are so much shit in the street.

But I say, what need have we of the highborn? Of what use in this land is rank, privilege, and taste? We need no masters but ourselves under a stern God.

( Meanwhile EDWARD, taking advantage of the hypnotic effect of MARGARETA' s rhetoric on PASTOR VAN DAM, steals his sword. EDWARD holds the PASTOR hostage.)

EDWARD HYDE
Set us free and give us safe conduct through your mob, madam. I hold the pastor as hostage.

MARGARETA
[ Draw's a pistol and shoots the PASTOR in the arm.]

No hostages.

[ Sighs of anguish issue from EDWARD' s party.]

Now I must insist you depart at once. If you persist in the folly of staying, I shudder to think what evils might befall your family.

EDWARD HYDE
[ Admitting defeat]

I see your point, madam. The wiser course would be for me to leave alone.

AFRICA
Don't go, my lord!

EDWARD HYDE
TO ensure that our accommodations will be suitable. I pray you, worry not.

MARIE HYDE
Je vais t'accompagner, mon cher Édouard.

EDWARD HYDE
How thoughtful, my dear, but this brief solitude will do me good.

MARIE HYDE
Édouard, they will kill you! Once you are gone I will suffer the same fate.

MARGARETA
Madam, we shall have need of the petty skills of a Frenchwoman. You can teach your courtly language and do some sewing.

MARIE HYDE
I'd rather die a martyr to my faith.

[ Crosses herself.]

MARGARETA
And as for this princess--

( She advances on AFRICA, MUNSEE bars the way.)

MUNSEE
Touch her and you die!

MARGARETA
Savage, I shall have you whipped until you beg for my Christian mercy.

MUNSEE
That you will never hear.

EDWARD HYDE
Oh, come, Margareta, 'tis me you despise. I shall do your bidding. Those with power have no need of rage.

RIP VAN DAM
Please, my lord, let me ride with you.

EDWARD HYDE
That won't be necessary.... Madam de Peyster, you will permit me a few moments to dress. It is not suitable for Lord Cornbury to ride to Harlem en déshabille.

MARGARETA
But of course.

EDWARD HYDE
Ah, me, I have nothing to wear.

[ Beat.]

But shortage puts an artist's mind to test; the very lack becomes a challenge.

(EDWARD surveys his party. The following is a ritual in which EDWARD as celebrant is dressed for a great ceremony.)

MARIE HYDE
Here, take my manto. It was you who chose it.

[ She removes her outer dress.]

AFRICA
This turban, my lord...

[ She hands him turban.]

... only I know its special knot.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Please accept my handkerchief of Venetian lace.

( He gives him a lace handkerchief. MUNSEE places his beads around EDWARD' s neck.)

RIP VAN DAM
I have nothing to give you--save my admiration.

[ He kisses EDWARD' s hand.]

EDWARD HYDE
[ Removing himself to a distance from the party.]

How do I look?

MARIE HYDE
Never better.

EDWARD HYDE
[ TO MARGARETA]

We are prepared for the journey, madam.

( Led by MARGARETA, EDWARD and PASTOR VAN DAM exit. MARIE falls to her knees and genuflects. The effect is like a baroque painting of the Magdalen: tears stream down her face, her hair is in disarray, and she lays bare her bosom.)

MARIE HYDE
Now I am truly alone.

[ She prays in French.]

SPINOZA DACOSTA
[ A cry from the heart: Psalm 30.]

"In you, O Lord, I take refuge.
Let me never be put to shame.
In your justice, set me free,
Hear me and speedily rescue me."

(AFRICA lowers her head and is comforted by MUNSEE.)

RIP VAN DAM
He was a great American.

( Suddenly a cannon salute shakes the theater, then a trumpet fanfare and the shouts of a cheering CROWD. Enter EDWARD on the arm of LORD RICHARD LOVELACE, followed by the now obsequious DE PEYSTER PARTY.)

SIR RICHARD LOVELACE
[ He looks like Louis Hayward in full court costume. His elegance is dazzling.]

... and so, my dear Edward, Sarah Churchill was livid, her husband in disgrace again, and she herself supplanted in the Queen's affection by that drab Abigail Hill.

EDWARD HYDE
You must have a million stories. But how are they doing their hair?

SIR RICHARD LOVELACE
Oh, Edward, there's not so variable a thing in nature as a lady's headdress.

EDWARD HYDE
My lord Lovelace, you know my wife.

MARIE HYDE
[ Curtsies.]

Welcome to New York, my lord.

SIR RICHARD LOVELACE
I fear, my lord and my lady Cornbury, I am the bearer of sad news. You are no longer Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, but Edward, Earl of Clarendon. Your father died four months ago.

MARIE HYDE
Enfin!

EDWARD HYDE
It's into black again.

SIR RICHARD LOVELACE
And you must make haste back to England to settle your vast inheritance.

( All congratulate EDWARD.)

MARIE HYDE
Who would have thought that the humble Marie Bouvier would one day be the Countess Clarendon?

SIR RICHARD LOVELACE
And now for the bad news.

[ Silence. All look at LOVELACE.]

I'm the new governor, and I order you, my lord Clarendon, to pay all your debts. Her Majesty herself told me, this time you've gone too far.

EDWARD HYDE
Her Majesty's wishes shall be obeyed.

MARGARETA
He owes me three thousand pounds! The swindler!

SIR RICHARD LOVELACE
Silence! Pursue your claims at the proper time. Can't you see his lordship is crushed by grief? Let us proceed to a less cramped abode.

[ Everyone leaves except EDWARD, LOVELACE, and RIP.]

Three months on that ship --I thought I'd go out of my mind! Now tell me everything.

[RIP diplomatically starts to take his leave.]

Who is he?

EDWARD HYDE
Master van Dam.

RIP VAN DAM
[ Approaches.]

Sir?

EDWARD HYDE
Governor Lovelace, allow me to present a most loyal friend and devoted protégé: Rip van Dam.

RIP VAN DAM
[ Bows.]

Your servant, sir.

SIR RICHARD LOVELACE
A friend of his lordship's should be a friend of mine. Will you do me the honor of attending the banquet this evening at the governor's mansion?

RIP VAN DAM
'Twill be a service I gladly perform.

[ As LOVELACE and RIP exit arm in arm... ]

SIR RICHARD LOVELACE
[ TO RIP]

You ride, of course. I've brought my favorite hunter with me. A roan with a white flame on her forehead. I call her Dawn....

EDWARD HYDE
[ Alone on stage. He picks up an hourglass.]

First a bath, then a rest-
'Tis this new-made earl's request.
Robed in mourning black as night,
Yet my fortune rises bright.

I'll need some rouge to pass this day;
So close to death, yet now I play.
A patch or two would fix my face;
To hide these jowls a bit of lace.

Virtue wins by merest whim;
Life proceeds by margins slim.
Governor Lovelace, wait for me! There's not a words I want to miss!

( He exits. Up immediately the end of Korngold's swashbuckling Seahawk music, which continues under the following Epilogue. A blue scrim and netting lower, suggesting a sailing ship. We hear sea bells and gulls and the sound of waves, also shouts such as "Draw up the anchor, mi'lads," "Heave ho, my hearties," and "Let her catch the wind." We are suddenly catapulted from the prison to the final scene of Rouben Mamoulian's Queen Christina -MGM, 1933.)

Epilogue
Enter MARIE and AFRICA in identical traveling cloaks.

MARIE HYDE
[ Now friendly to AFRICA]

There are so many sights, Princesse, that I wish to show you. Your début at court will be extraordinaire.

AFRICA
[ Fluently]

Merci mille fois, ma chère Marie. But don't you look forward to the benefits of a sea voyage! after so much excitement? Lord Lovelace was a most generous host. Last night's banquet proved splendid.

MARIE HYDE
Marred only by the news of the untimely death of Margareta de Peyster.

AFRICA
One must be careful of what one eats.

( They turn to each other and smile. Enter SPINOZA in the same kind of cloak.)

MARIE AND AFRICA
[ To SPINOZA]

Bonjour, monsieur.

[ He bows.]

MARIE HYDE
We voyage only to England but you go much farther, to the land holy to both of us. Pray, sir, a request.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Certainly, madam.

MARIE HYDE
That I receive from Jerusalem a piece of the True Cross.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
I shall do my utmost, my dear lady.

[ Enter MUNSEE in cloak.]

But grant me this wish.

MUNSEE
I wish to see the world.

SPINOZA DACOSTA
Take him under your protection.

MARIE HYDE
The glamour attached to such patronage will resound to my credit. An African princess and a Red Indian prince. Quelle triomphe!

( Enter EDWARD in cloak with MOLLY, who carries a wicker basket.)

MOLLY
... remember, your grace, a lemon a day keeps the scurvy away. Watch out for the swine fever! If the countess feels poorly, these jams will bring her around.

EDWARD HYDE
Thank you, my friend.

MOLLY
And don't forget, Your Grace, my sister Henrietta --she lives above the Boar and Rose--they all know her. Tell her not to come here. New York is scarce ready for her yet. I best be off, or I shall start to cry.

[ She attempts to curtsy and leaves.]

EDWARD HYDE
[ Standing center stage]

Adieu. We're on our way at last!

[ The audience becomes the people on shore and the sights of New York harbor. All wave good-bye.]

Look, Marie, the steeple of Trinity Church!

The Brooklyn Ferry.

MUNSEE
The East River.

EDWARD HYDE
[ Like Garbo in Queen Christina, the wind ruffling his hair. The music gradually swells.]

You know, my friends, no matter what the vicissitudes that fate will bring--corruption, crowding, the overexuberance of

spirits that strangers mistake for rude manners--I believe that someday New York will be great. It will always rise Phoenix-like from disasters. With its great towers it will be the envy of its sister cities, a beacon to the Old World, and a gateway to the New.... Pray, do you think History will remember us?

( A deafening cannon salute.)

MARIE HYDE
Hear, Édouard, how they love us!
