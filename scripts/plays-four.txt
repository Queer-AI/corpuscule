Introduction

Hotel, This is a Chair and the two plays in Blue Heart all come from around the same time, 1994–5, and from a similar mindset. Hotel isn’t a play but an opera libretto. This is a Chair is a series of impressive subjects that a play might address and the scenes don’t address them. Heart’s Desire is a play that can’t happen, obsessively resetting itself back to the beginning every time it veers off-course. Blue Kettle is a play infected with a virus.

Hotel was written for Orlando Gough, and Ian Spink directed it for Second Stride with reckless generosity despite the large cast. I fear the large company and few performances may have been one of the reasons the Arts Council cut the grant of this great, innovative company.

The first piece, itself originally called Hotel, was written first. I’ve never liked too many words in an opera and don’t want to be reading while I listen or straining to extricate sentences from the music. So I went for few words and no sentences, just scraps of what the characters are thinking or saying, which can easily be picked up and can also just be heard as sound when they are repeated or combined. Occasionally people ask if it can be performed as a play, without music, but that seems to miss the point. The characters can sing together from their separate rooms as they sit together on the same bed watching the same TV.

We then decided to make a second piece, so we renamed Hotel as Eight Rooms and the new piece Two Nights. Here the dancers who played the silent couple in Eight Rooms played the central characters, and Ian choreographed their hotel-room stories, while the singers were more of a chorus. Their text is supposed to be fragments of a diary found in the hotel room of someone who has disappeared. I think it’s all right to perform either of the pieces separately.

Around this time I wrote a short scene of a quarrel, using just scraps of what is said and racing through a whole evening in five minutes. I can’t remember if this was before or after I wrote Hotel. I was looking at the same question – how little do we need to hear to understand what’s going on? – but from a different motive, not music but impatience. Soon after that I wrote This is a Chair, and later director Stephen Daldry and I decided to include the scene (as ‘Hong Kong’), partly to make the play a bit longer, I think, and partly because it looked as if it would be fun to work on. It was, though it took a disproportionate amount of rehearsal: if time passes between every line, should the gestures and position of the actors change? And the scene has to go fast, of course, with no gaps for the missing time. The scene sits a little oddly in This is a Chair because it’s written differently from the others but also I like it there, so it can be left in or out in performance. The titles should probably be updated for new productions, and I’m happy to have suggestions run by me. Nowadays ‘The War in Afghanistan’ would probably be a title, and ‘Climate Change’ would be there. Though not, of course, written about.

The Blue Heart plays, I realised afterwards, can be roughly linked in subject matter by being described as a family waiting for their daughter and a son looking for his mother. But the plays are McGuffins – my main intention was their destruction.

Some time after all this, 1999, I wrote Far Away, which feels to me quite different as the play isn’t being undermined. The three parts can seem disconnected, linked only by the girl who goes through them and widening hostilities, but I think they are also linked by the characters’ desire to be on the side of what’s right.

A Number has cloning at the centre of its story but I never quite feel it’s a play about cloning. The cloning’s not quite a McGuffin but it does let me look at a lot of things that interest me. I realised after I’d written it that I’d thought about some of the same things in Identical Twins more than twenty-five years earlier. I’m reluctant to give advice rather than let the play stand on its own feet now, but I will point out that Michael isn’t a fool. It’s easy to make him a laughing stock to the audience, because he fails to come up with something that satisfies Salter, but his answers seem to me good ones and a serious answer to Salter’s search for some essence of a person. That doesn’t mean there aren’t laughs in the scene.

I came up with a text of Strindberg’s Dream Play for Katie Mitchell, who was planning to direct it at the National Theatre in London. I didn’t go to the Swedish – which I don’t know, but looking at it would have told me something – but worked from a translation by Charlotte Barslund, given to me by the National. Katie had some cuts in mind and I made a few as well. I slightly regret losing the first scene where the daughter comes down to earth, which balances her departure at the end, but apparently that was an afterthought of Strindberg’s in any case, and the focus of the production was not the daughter’s story but a dreamer’s. There were more cuts in rehearsal, and dance and more dreams, so this text isn’t an account of the production, but what I gave Katie as a starting point. I feel wary of cuts and ‘versions’, as opposed to complete and skilful translations by someone who knows both languages but perhaps there’s a place for both, for writers lucky enough to still be performed when they’re dead.

Drunk Enough to Say I Love You? was originally called in my head ‘The Man Who Fell in Love with America’. But that seemed to tell too much. A lot of people all over the world have a kind of romance with America or its culture or the idea of it, even if they also increasingly and simultaneously dislike it. Sam was always Sam, as in Uncle, as in political cartoons where he stands for America. The other character didn’t have a name while I was writing the play, and when I had to come up with one I thought of Jack as an everyday name – Jack of all trades, Jack the lad. What I didn’t think, stupidly, was Union Jack, which was the quite sensible conclusion some people jumped to. That made the man in love with America be seen as Britain, as Sam was America. It was hard enough anyway to understand that Sam was a country while the person in love with him was just a man, like someone in the audience, and now I’d shot myself in the foot. I tried to get the play away from the misconceptions for the New York production by changing the man’s name to Guy (a guy, ha ha, far too obvious but I was past caring) and in Germany he was German. I’d always imagined he would just be someone from whatever country the play was done in. He could even be an American citizen in an American production, patriotically in love with his country and increasingly disillusioned. Another misconception was that the characters stood for Bush and Blair, specially as they began to be portrayed in cartoons as lovers. But the play looks at America’s foreign policy from far further back, any time since the Second World War. Some people seemed surprised by the Iraq War as if it was an aberration caused by Bush and the neocons, but though it’s an extreme example it’s not so different from the general thrust of American policy for most of its history, and part of my point in writing the play was precisely that this was not just something that had come with Bush and would go away after him. I read a number of books to learn more details and found William Blum’s Rogue State and Killing Hope particularly useful.

The love story is chronological and that is the story the actors play. The actions they are taking are divided into subjects – elections, bombing, trade – and in each scene they can be taken from any time but are happening now, in the moment, for the characters, who are fixing an election, bombing a country, as they speak. The problem of how to get in all those facts without being clunky, how to get the characters from one activity to the next, was solved, I hope, by using that same technique as in the little quarrel scene ten or so years earlier: moving swiftly on, giving just a few words and leaping forward to another part of the conversation. Again there’s a problem of how to perform it, and the potential jerkiness of demonstrating the time gaps is probably too much for a longer piece. The challenge is for the emotional story between the lovers to stay continuous while the subject matter hurtles on and is a new moment in each line.

Introductions

CARYL CHURCHILL

Eight Rooms

I kept thinking about a lot of different stories all happening on stage at once. How to cope with all those people talking at the same time? Easily of course if they’re not talking but singing, and in any case I wanted to write an opera for Orlando. At some point I had the idea of a hotel where we’d see all the identical rooms superimposed as one room, all the people in the same space. And what sort of words should they sing? When I’m listening to sung words I like taking their meaning in without any effort, and I’m also happy to hear them just as sound. What I don’t like is feeling I may be missing something important if I don’t follow every word. What do I want from words in an opera? A situation, an emotion, an image. Some of the sections that had stayed with me most from Lives of the Great Poisoners (a 1991 piece with Orlando and Ian) had very simple words that could be taken in quickly and repeated. The little opera scene in The Skriker (1994, music by Judith Weir) had words without the usual structure of sentences (welcome homesick drink drank drunk) but it was easy to understand what was happening. So in Hotel, how little need the characters say to let us know enough about them? I decided there would be no complete sentences, just little chunks of what was said or thought, that could be absorbed first time round or in a repeat or even never.

Two Nights

In Eight Rooms each of the thirteen singers is a different character; in Two Nights they all sing a diary that has been left in a hotel room. The silent performers in Eight Rooms now play two people who spend different nights in the same room. We want this piece to start from ideas about the choreography and Ian maps out the two stories, though the first thing to be set is the words, then the music, and the details of the choreography are to be worked out in rehearsal. Both the characters disappear in different ways, and the diary is written by someone who becomes invisible. What might be in a diary apart from how the body begins to vanish? Notes about other kinds of disappearance. On the internet I found worry about cities disappearing in smog, a magician making a building disappear, a Canadian legal judgement about objects that go missing, an anarchist using disappearance rather than confrontation as a ‘logical radical option’, and a spell for becoming invisible translated from Greek magical documents. Again I used few words, glimpses as we flick through someone else’s diary.

ORLANDO GOUGH

Eight Rooms

Caryl says What do you like about opera? I say The bits when everyone sings at once.

So what about this? Caryl says: one night in a hotel; eight rooms are seen simultaneously. Excellent! Off we go.

People sing duets, trios, quartets with people they never meet. Their lives intersect in the realm of shared emotion, in the realm of counterpoint and polyphony.

The action is everyday, consciously undramatic.

Is it possible to write an opera of everyday life? Isn’t there an inherent contradiction? Isn’t the function of opera to deal with extremes of emotion? Should not action resolve character?

A fragmentary libretto. Already a move away from naturalism. Allows me to compose the music, i.e. make the text into music, rather than being dragged along by the words.

A cyclic structure. The piece ends almost as it began. A sense that the next night would be similar. We are interested in these people only while they are in the hotel. A crowd looked at from afar (with occasional help of a pair of binoculars).

Opera singers. NO!

Working with jazz singers. Should I give opportunities to improvise? Surely I am wasting their talent if I don’t? However, I am not sure about this idea ‘opportunities to improvise’. If the music after the improvised passage is not affected by the improvisation, then surely the improviser is just filling in time? . . . I get very excited by the idea of a completely improvised opera, and then funk it. Six months’ rehearsal would be barely enough.

A lean, functional band: piano duet and double bass. Almost like a jazz rhythm section. A modest but utterly crucial role. However, the emotional energy must come from the singers. Thirteen singers and three players! – almost the mirror image of many modern chamber operas, where complex texture is created with an important role for the band and the singers are treated almost like instrumentalists.

Two Nights

A companion for Eight Rooms – not necessarily a friend. Same cast. What else happens in hotels? says Ian. A hotel is where you might go, for privacy, to do something lonely, radical, extreme, life changing, terminal. Sid Vicious.

I want the music to be very different from Eight Rooms: the singers will be a choir.

A diary has been left in the room. The singers will sing the contents of the diary.

A kind of song cycle. Harmony rather than counterpoint. (Yikes, not my strong point.) Drama! Risk! A linear structure – a sense of not being able to retrace one’s steps. Though one might want to. A much darker piece than Eight Rooms.

The dancers, who have had a peripheral role in Eight Rooms, are now centre stage. The singers… sing, and occasionally take part in the action.

The subject matter of Two Nights is definitely ‘operatic’. But we haven’t written an opera…

Should the dancing mimic the text? NO! Should it ignore the text? Not quite – it should connect, but on an emotional rather than literal level.

The old problem again: the text and the music are written in advance; the choreography can’t exist until rehearsals start. How can the choreographer be expected to work with such an unbending structure? We consider scrapping the text and the music and making a devised piece (on the same theme) in rehearsal. An exhilarating and alarming idea. The singers’ ability to improvise is a catalyst. We funk it. Cowards! Two months’ rehearsals needed, minimum.

‘You put so much emotion into singing your love songs, spend the evening pouring your heart out, but then go back to your hotel alone.’ k.d. lang (speaking in The Independent)

‘To be inside that music, to be drawn into the circle of its repetitions: perhaps that is a place where one could finally disappear.’ Paul Auster, City of Glass (Faber and Faber)

IAN SPINK

Eight Rooms

. . . began as a challenge. How do you fit fourteen hotel guests into one room? What happens when they all eventually go to bed? The potential for enormous traffic jams in such an intimate space seemed huge and fascinating. In rehearsal we were to discover that the simplest of acts, the cleaning of teeth, the hanging up of a dress, the reading of a magazine, demanded a relaxed yet rigorous precision when taking into account the thirteen other occupants of the space.

The hotel room channels many threads of action into a single stream of human experience covering a period of perhaps sixteen hours. Guests arrive, tiny incidents are briefly exposed; a drunken couple argue, a young woman dreams of a bird, an American plans a game of golf, a French couple drink tea, a business man rings home, two lovers whisper, a wife considers her marriage, a silent couple watch television. In one sense ordinary and unambiguous activities but collected together they produce a touching and mesmeric atmosphere. In the morning these people prepare to leave; a woman packs her case, a man comments on the weather, another orders breakfast, an insomniac finally succumbs to sleep. The sparse yet humane text combines with the music to produce a strangely uplifting piece of theatre.

Two Nights

Created some time later, Two Nights has become for me, an antidote to Eight Rooms. Here the challenge was, can you weave together three almost unrelated stories and play them out in the same location? The hotel room is now a more ambiguous, dangerous place, a catalyst for darker journeys, two of them danced, one of them sung to a sparkling counterpoint score. The singers have become a choral accompaniment and occasional extras to the choreographed action. A trapped woman struggles with her conscience and seeks salvation surrounded by strangers, a man haunted by his past is about to end his life. Their stories are danced out in extreme, dramatic bursts accompanied by entries from an abandoned diary, the diary of someone who has become invisible. The three self-contained threads playing simultaneously, are about magic, deception and transformation.



Hotel was first performed by Second Stride at the Schauspielhaus, Hanover, Germany, on 15 April 1997, and subsequently on tour, including to The Place, London, with the following cast:

I’m so sorry.



JULIAN

That’s all right, don’t worry.



MARY

Have you been here ages?



JULIAN

I got you these.



MARY

They’re beautiful.



JULIAN

I don’t know what you like.



MARY

Thank you very much.



JULIAN

I like orange and blue together, I don’t know if you do, I thought of roses but I think roses are a bit dull, I don’t like pink and red very much as colours, I don’t mind yellow but I thought these.



MARY

Listen, I’m afraid there’s a problem.



JULIAN

Yes.



MARY

I’ve made a stupid mistake.



JULIAN

Never mind.



MARY

No but I’ve made two different arrangements for the same evening, I’ve doublebooked myself, I don’t know how I can be so stupid.



JULIAN

So you have to make a phonecall or . . . ?



MARY

No, it’s really awful, what I have to do is jump in a cab and go whizzing off. Because I have to be there by half past seven.



JULIAN

Something starts at half past seven?



MARY

Yes and I couldn’t reach the other person and anyway the tickets and . . .



JULIAN

Don’t worry.



MARY

It is a concert I particularly . . .



JULIAN

Yes of course. We’d better look for a cab.



MARY

It was the arrangement I made first you see and somehow it slipped my mind and I thought we might have time for a drink anyway but then I was late finishing work and there was a hold-up on the tube it stopped in the tunnel for about five minutes people were starting to get nervous you could see from the way they kept on reading or just staring into space but deliberately because they were getting nervous and anyway can we make it another time I’m really sorry.



JULIAN

Don’t worry.



MARY

What about Tuesday?



JULIAN

I can’t do Tuesdays.



MARY

Or Thursday, no wait I can’t do Thursday, Friday oh shit, the week after, any night you like, not Wednesday.



JULIAN

Thursday then.



MARY

Thursday week then.



JULIAN

Same time same place?



MARY

Yes this is good for me. I won’t be late.



JULIAN

Don’t worry. There’s a cab.

JOHN comes in.



JOHN

I can’t find nothing in the bedroom.



TED

JOHN

TED

He ran on the balcony and jumped over.



JOHN

He what?



TED

I can’t look.



ANN

I’m going down. You did it, I’ll tell everyone you did it, why can’t you keep out of my life.





ANN goes.



TED

I just said we’ve had enough of you. I didn’t touch him.



JOHN

He knew what we was here for.



TED

He knew we were here to say you got our sister on drugs.



JOHN

And we said that.



TED

That’s all we said.



JOHN

We weren’t going to kill him or nothing.



TED

We were going to give him a smack.



JOHN

That’s all right. Anyone expects a smack.



TED

We’ll say exactly what happened. We don’t need a story, do we, I mean what happened is what happened is perfectly all right.



JOHN

He might not be dead you know.



TED

I can’t look.



JOHN

I’ll look.



TED

Go on then.



JOHN

Yes I’m going to.



TED

He must have been out of his head is what it is.



JOHN

They’ll see what he was on at the hospital.



TED

Maybe it’s something he was going to do whether we come or not.



JOHN

Don’t be stupid.



TED

So are you going to look or what?



JOHN

Yes I’m going to look.



TED

What a stupid bastard.



JOHN

Do you think she’s down there by now? I’ll have a look.





Animal Conservation and Third World Economies: the Ivory Trade

DEIRDRE and POLLY.



DEIRDRE

I’m going to hospital on Monday.



POLLY

Nothing serious?



DEIRDRE

No not at all but I’ve got to swallow a tube.



POLLY

I could go with you if you like.



DEIRDRE

No, it’s nothing, I’ve done it before. You can do it with drugs or without.



POLLY

With.



DEIRDRE

I did do with the first time, I wasn’t given a choice, but last time they said it only takes a couple of minutes do you want to try without. I said how often do people do that and they said about fifty fifty and I said and what do they say about it afterwards and they said oh they’re fine about it, honestly, but of course if you haven’t anything to do this afternoon and don’t mind being drugged up – so put like that of course it was a challenge.



POLLY

And was it horrible?



DEIRDRE

The worst bit’s when it goes over the throat. You have to keep breathing deeply, like being in labour except not. But everything taking second place to your body. And when it’s over you feel terrific. I walked home because I’d got a whole extra afternoon but that was stupid because I got exhausted because I hadn’t eaten or drunk anything since half past seven. And of course at the time I thought it was good not putting poison in my body but afterwards I thought they were just trying to save money.



POLLY

Of course they were. Didn’t you realise that?



DEIRDRE

So maybe on Monday I’ll have the drugs.



POLLY

I’d definitely have the drugs.



DEIRDRE

I probably will. Yes I think I’ll definitely go for the drugs.

BRIAN

We should have met the plane.



ALICE

We should not.



MAISIE

What I really envy her for is the fauna because it’s down a completely separate branch of evolution and I would love I would really love to see a platypus, not in a zoo but in its natural habitat. Imagine going to feed the ducks and there is some thing that is not a duck and nor is it a waterrat or a mole, it’s the paws make me think of a mole, but imagine this furry creature with its ducky face, it makes you think what else could have existed, tigers with trunks, anyway the platypus has always been my favourite animal, it doesn’t lay eggs like a duck, it’s a marsupial like a kangaroo so the baby’s born like a thread like a speck and has to crawl into the pouch, is that right, is a platypus a marsupial or not actually I’m not sure about that, maybe it does lay eggs like a duck, I’ll look it up or I’ll ask her when she comes and I wonder if she’s ever seen one, maybe she went swimming in a river and there was this little furry –

That’s it.



BRIAN

It’s what?



ALICE

I’m leaving.



BRIAN

Oh ha ha we’re all supposed to be frantic and beg you to stay and say very sorry.



ALICE

I wouldn’t bother.

You’ll see her when you’re sober.

Now it’s all right, Brian. Susy isn’t here yet, Lewis.

MAISIE

Are you going to tell her straight away?



BRIAN

That’s not something for you to worry about, Maisie.



ALICE

We’re all in it together.



MAISIE

We’ve all got perfectly good alibis.



BRIAN

But they don’t believe alibis any more. It’s all forensic, it’s all genetic.



ALICE

But there can’t be any forensic if none of us did anything, I don’t know why you have to act like a guilty person when it’s nothing to do with any of us except that the body was found in our garden, it was dumped in our garden as everybody knows.



MAISIE

I keep telling the police about the postman but they haven’t taken it in.



BRIAN

I happen to know that a great many people are wrongfully convicted and I don’t live in a dream that suggests that terrible things only befall people in newspapers.

ALICE

That’s all right if that’s what she wants to do.

You make yourself a doormat to that girl, you always did, she won’t be grateful for lunch she’ll be on a diet.

I’m unhappy. What are you going to do about it?



ALICE

You know you have to help yourself, Lewis.



LEWIS

But it never stops.



BRIAN

Lewis, I wish you’d died at birth. If I’d known what you’d grow up like I’d have killed either you or myself the day you were born.

Don’t tell me what not to do. Has everyone been deceiving me?



MAISIE

I did know a little bit.



BRIAN

Fifteen . . . ? you mean when we were on holiday in Portugal you were already . . . ?





Reset to after ‘spoilt it’.



ALICE

All I’m saying is be nice to her.



BRIAN

Be nice to her?



ALICE

Yes I’m just saying be nice to her.



BRIAN

When am I not nice to her? am I not a good father is that what you’re going to say? do you want to say that? say it.



ALICE

I’m just –



BRIAN

Say it say it.



ALICE

Just be nice to her that’s all.



BRIAN

Nice.



ALICE

Fine, you’re going to be nice that’s all I’m saying.



BRIAN

I should leave you. I’m the one should have gone to Australia.



ALICE

Go back with her I should.



BRIAN

Maybe I’ll do that.



ALICE

Though mind you she wouldn’t stay in Australia in that case would she? She’d have to move on to New Zealand. Or Hawaii, I think she’d move to Tonga probably.



MAISIE

I do think waiting is one of the hardest things.



BRIAN

Waiting isn’t the problem.



MAISIE

Is something else?



BRIAN

Of course not.



ALICE

Something is.



BRIAN

I’m terribly hungry.



MAISIE

We’re all getting a bit peckish. Why don’t I cut up some little cubes of cheese?



BRIAN

No, I’m hungry – I’ll tell you.



ALICE

What?



BRIAN

I’m telling you. I have this terrible urge to eat myself.



ALICE

To bite your skin?



BRIAN

Yes to bite but to eat – never mind.



ALICE

No it’s all right, you can tell us.



BRIAN

Starting with my fingernails like this –



MAISIE

Yes you always have bitten your fingernails.



BRIAN

But the whole finger, if I hold it with my other hand it won’t happen but what I want to do is chew up my finger, I want my whole hand in my mouth. Don’t despise me.



ALICE

Of course not, dear. I’m sure plenty of people –



BRIAN

My whole arm, swallow it right up to the shoulder, then the other arm gobble gobble up to the shoulder, and big bite left big bite right that’s both the shoulders in.



MAISIE

Is this something you’ve always wanted to do or –?



BRIAN

And the shoulders bring the rest of my body, eat my heart, eat my lungs, down my ribs I go, munch my belly, crunch my prick, and oh my whole body’s in my mouth now so there’s just my legs sticking out, I’ve eaten it all up.



ALICE

Have you thought of seeing someone about –



BRIAN

Then snap snap up my legs to the knees the calves the ankles just the feet sticking out of my mouth now gollop gollop I’ve swallowed my feet, there’s only my head and my big mouth wants it, my big mouth turns round and ahh there goes my head into my mouth I’ve swallowed my head I’ve swallowed my whole self up I’m all mouth can my mouth swallow my mouth yes yes my mouth’s taking a big bite ahh.

I do think waiting is one of the hardest things. Waiting for arrivals and also waiting to say goodbye, that’s even worse when you’re waiting on a station platform or a quayside or the airport or just at home the day someone’s going waiting for the time when they go I think that’s far worse than when they’ve gone though of course when they’ve gone you think why didn’t I make better use of them when they were still there, you can’t do right in those situations.



BRIAN

It’s not that you don’t have a sense of occasion. You know exactly what an occasion is and you deliberately set out to ruin it. I’ve thought for forty years you were a stupid woman, now I know you’re simply nasty.





LEWIS comes in, drunk.



LEWIS

It’s time we had it out. It’s time we spoke the truth.



MAISIE

Lewis, you’re always speaking the truth and where does it get you?



LEWIS

I want my life to begin.



ALICE

Lewis, there is one little rule in this house and what is it? it is that you don’t come into this room when you’ve been drinking. Do we stop you drinking? no because we can’t stop you drinking. Do we throw you out in the street? no because for some reason we are too tenderhearted and that is probably wrong of us. But there is one little rule and if you keep breaking it –

Out. Out.



LEWIS

No more. No more. No more.

It’s great to be here. Susy’s told me so much about you. She said to be sure to look you up.

Did you travel in separately from the airport? Did you come on the tube?

I came on a bus.

That’s a good way.

I’m not afraid of an afterlife well maybe a little, I’d rather there wasn’t one wouldn’t you, imagine finding you were dead that would be frightening but of course maybe it wouldn’t we don’t know, but really I think we just stop, I think either we’re alive or we know nothing so death never really happens to us, but still sometimes in the night there’s a chill in my blood and I think what is it what am I frightened of and then I think oh death that’s what it is again and I –

Well we didn’t so I don’t see the point of worrying about it now.

1. DEREK, MRS PLANT.

MRS PLANT

I can’t speak.



DEREK

Don’t worry.



MRS PLANT

Let me look at you.



DEREK

Have I got your nose?



MRS PLANT

You might have your father’s mouth. I can’t quite see his mouth but now I see yours . . .



DEREK

My mouth?



MRS PLANT

Your grandmother’s eyes were that colour. Yes, he had a smile.



DEREK

Bit of a heartbreaker was he, my dad? You don’t mind me asking?



MRS PLANT

Bit of a shit of course but at the time, if I tell you he was twenty-two and I was sixteen. And he had a lambretta. What does that mean, you’ll say. I’d hold on round his back and we could get out into the country. I’ve been in fields since but I’ve never seen buttercups comparable.



DEREK

So you’d say you’d got happy memories?



MRS PLANT

I’ve memories of having been happy certainly but then I saw him in the street with Julia Studley and it was after that I found out what had happened and I told them I’d be ashamed to marry someone that didn’t want me and they said all right but it’s adoption then. Because you didn’t have abortion like now and anyway I was already thinking of it as a little doll. So there’s that much to thank me for.



DEREK

I do.



MRS PLANT

Where do you live?



DEREK

In London.



MRS PLANT

What part of London?



DEREK

Crouch End.



MRS PLANT

No I don’t know that.



DEREK

What’s your husband going to say?



MRS PLANT

He’ll be glad for me.



DEREK

Will he?



MRS PLANT

He’s always known all about it. Your brothers don’t know.



DEREK

What will they say?



MRS PLANT

We’ll find out.



DEREK

I don’t want to embarrass you.



MRS PLANT

You couldn’t ever embarrass me, my dear. And are you all right where you live?



DEREK

I’m fine, yes.



MRS PLANT

Do you live on your own?



DEREK

I’ve got a girlfriend.



MRS PLANT

That’s nice. What’s her name?



DEREK

Enid.



MRS PLANT

That’s nice, it’s an oldfashioned name.



DEREK

She’s called after her grandmother.



MRS PLANT

Do you hate me?



DEREK

No, I think you’re wonderful.



MRS PLANT

I had a name for you. I called you Tom. But when I gave you up I said you hadn’t got a name, I thought who you went to would like to give you their own name, I thought that was fair.



DEREK

Tom’s nice.



MRS PLANT

Do you like it?



DEREK

Yes I do.





2. DEREK, MRS OLIVER.

MRS OLIVER

I brought some photographs. I don’t know if you want to see them.



DEREK

I’d love to.



MRS OLIVER

This is my sister Eileen. And here she is again with her husband Bob and the twins. That’s thirty years ago. This is my parents. He was a good looking man. This is me and Brian and the girls when they were little and this is Mary grown up and her husband Phil and their two which is Billy and Megan, now you may not agree but I think where the family likeness is is in Billy you see which is your nephew. Do you see what I mean?



DEREK

Yes I do.



MRS OLIVER

Round the eyes.



DEREK

The eyes yes and –



MRS OLIVER

Something about the shape of the head I think.



DEREK

You’re right, yes.



MRS OLIVER

And where that comes from is my father and his father though I don’t have a picture with me of him, he was a cabinet maker in Yorkshire. This is my other daughter you see, Jenny, and hers, which is Kevin, Mat and Susy. Now what you’ll want to see, I do have this one picture of your father, it’s not very clear but it’s better than nothing. He was better looking than that. The sun was in his eyes.



DEREK

He looks great.



MRS OLIVER

He was all right.



DEREK

Do you mind if I ask . . . Does your family know about me?



MRS OLIVER

No.



DEREK

No they don’t know?



MRS OLIVER

No.



DEREK

They don’t know, no. That’s understandable.



MRS OLIVER

I never told my husband.



DEREK

So of course you wouldn’t want to now.



MRS OLIVER

He’s dead now.



DEREK

I’m sorry.



MRS OLIVER

It makes things easier for you. But I’m not pleased about that. I’d rather have told him. I don’t like starting something up now that he never knew about.



DEREK

You don’t have to blue anything up.



MRS OLIVER

I have done. I’ve come and met you.



DEREK

Well it’s good we’ve set eyes on each other. It means a lot to me.



MRS OLIVER

I have this entire family.



DEREK

I appreciate that.



MRS OLIVER

Do your parents, your adoptive parents should I call them, your real parents, do they know you’ve done this?



DEREK

No they don’t.



MRS OLIVER

And will you tell them?



DEREK

They don’t know I know I’m adopted. I found out by mistake when I was sixteen and I kept waiting and I never said anything.



MRS OLIVER

There you are.



DEREK

I’m not saying it’s an easy situation.



MRS OLIVER

We don’t necessarily have anything in common.



DEREK

Of course not.



MRS OLIVER

Do you believe in heredity?



DEREK

A bit.



MRS OLIVER

But then there’s how you’re brought up. There’s family jokes.



DEREK

Exactly.



MRS OLIVER

I mean I look at you and you could be anyone.



DEREK

Of course.



MRS OLIVER

You shouldn’t expect to be loved.



DEREK

I don’t.



MRS OLIVER

You have been loved I hope? by your family?



DEREK

Yes I have.



MRS OLIVER

That’s a relief anyway.



DEREK

We don’t have to see each other again.



MRS OLIVER

Of course we don’t have to.



DEREK

We have the choice. And we don’t have to make a choice. The choice is just available.



MRS OLIVER

Exactly and that’s not like having nothing is it, having the kettle of seeing your son or not, it’s not life like before.



DEREK

No it’s not.



MRS OLIVER

I live on my own. It won’t be any trouble seeing you. I won’t have to lie to anyone to get out of the house. But if I don’t tell my children that will be the same as a lie.



DEREK

But you always haven’t told them. Sorry.



MRS OLIVER

And if I do tell them, then there’s telling them. There’s you being part of our family.



DEREK

I could be a distant part. Like a second cousin that you know he’s there but you never see him.



MRS OLIVER

Do you think it would be like that?



DEREK

I don’t know what it would be like.



MRS OLIVER

It was such a long time ago.





3. DEREK, ENID.

ENID

I phoned my aunt today and she was dead.



DEREK

That’s your own fault.



ENID

She’d been dead three years.



DEREK

I told you you should have phoned her before.



ENID

All right.



DEREK

So blue didn’t anyone let you know?



ENID

Why do you think?



DEREK

There might have been somebody.



ENID

If she didn’t know where I was how were her neighbours supposed to know where I was? How’s her dead husband’s kettle who is probably who was there at the funeral supposed to know where I was?



DEREK

Who did you speak to?



ENID

Whoever lives in the house.



DEREK

And?



ENID

You know the kind of thing they’re going to have said, they said Mrs who? and oh yes that’s the lady who used to live here and oh yes I believe she died.



DEREK

Believe she died?



ENID

She died.



DEREK

Might she have not died?



ENID

The estate agent told them she died.



DEREK

So shouldn’t we talk to the estate kettle? Who’d she leave the house to? Who got the money for the house?



ENID

Her husband’s cousin.



DEREK

Don’t you care?



ENID

I thought I at least had an aunty.



DEREK

She’ll have left you something. She probably left you the house.



ENID

No she won’t have left me anything.



DEREK

You should find the husband’s cousin.



ENID

I made up the kettle’s cousin.



DEREK

There’s going to be someone. I’ll find them for you.



ENID

No.



DEREK

I’m good at finding relations.



ENID

I know you are.



DEREK

Or the estate agent will know who was the solicitor.



ENID

Not yet.



DEREK

Money.



ENID

So how many mothers have you got now?



DEREK

Five.



ENID

What are you going to do with them?



DEREK

I see them.



ENID

And then what?



DEREK

We’ll see what.



ENID

And you think there’s money in it.



DEREK

Of course I blue there’s money in it.



ENID

What money?



DEREK

We’ll see what money.



ENID

It’s stupid.



DEREK

It’s a laugh.



ENID

Have them all to tea the same kettle.



DEREK

Ho ho. There is one of them wants to meet you.



ENID

No, let’s not.



DEREK

It’ll be fine.



ENID

No it’s your hobby and I don’t mind but I’m no good at lying, don’t get me to do anything.



DEREK

You don’t have to lie, you’re my girlfriend, you are my girlfriend. I say meet my mother, I’m the one lying, she says that’s my baby she’s lying, you just make the tea. You can call her aunty.



ENID

I’d tell her the truth.



DEREK

Then I’d kill you.



ENID

Blue do you kettle it for? You’ve a perfectly good mother of your own.



DEREK

What do you think I should do?





4. DEREK, MRS VANE.

MRS VANE

It wasn’t that I didn’t love my husband. But it wasn’t that I didn’t love your father. There was nothing trivial about your father. I thought you’d like to know that.



DEREK

I appreciate it.



MRS VANE

I burnt all the letters and the two photographs. I made a clean blue. Because I did want things to work out with my husband.



DEREK

And did they work out?



MRS VANE

They worked out sufficiently.



DEREK

And did he ever know kettle about it?



MRS VANE

I could have pretended the child was his but I wouldn’t do that. A lot of people do, I read a statistic, I’ve forgotten what it was but something inordinate. And in fact we never had children. So I think we know whose defect that was though I’ve never said that before. I can say anything to you, can’t I. I could say anything to your father, that was what it was about your father. And his eyes. I see no resemblance at all. Except in my feeling.



DEREK

Did you ever think you might . . . did you suggest to your husband . . . I suppose it wasn’t something you could even imagine . . .



MRS VANE

Keep you as a child of the family? Yes of course we discussed that. And decided against. He decided, I decided, I agreed, that was what was settled on. We thought it would make us unhappy.



DEREK

You didn’t know you kettle have other children.



MRS VANE

And don’t ask if it would have made a difference, I don’t know if it would have made a difference. How old were you when you found out you were adopted?



DEREK

They managed that very well, I always knew. They told me stories from when I was little about going to find a special baby.



MRS VANE

They must be nice people.



DEREK

So there was never a shock. Maybe that’s blue I didn’t look for you sooner. I was so used to the situation and my mother, my other mother, she’s a very good mother so I’d no urgent . . . I think it’s to do with getting old.



MRS VANE

You think you’re kettle old?



DEREK

Forty’s getting old.



MRS VANE

It is at the time, one forgets. No children of your own?



DEREK

You’d like grandchildren?



MRS VANE

That’s not very kind.



DEREK

I don’t blue very kind, sorry. No, for some kettle no children. Maybe this is something I need to do first, before I can have children. You see?



MRS VANE

And your girlfriend? does she want children?



DEREK

She’s only thirty and we’ve not been together a year. She might in a bit.



MRS VANE

And before her?



DEREK

Various people.



MRS VANE

So what did you think your mother would be like? Am I not like it?



DEREK

I’m sorry, I’m a bit upset.



MRS VANE

It would be remarkable if we weren’t both upset. There’s kettle I’d like you to do for me if you would. I’d like you and your girlfriend to come to dinner at my house and meet my husband. And I’d like to keep who you are a secret.



DEREK

Why do that?



MRS VANE

I want to.



DEREK

Why not just not tell him if we’re not telling him and you and me and Enid could go out to a restaurant?



MRS VANE

Because I want to see you in my house.



DEREK

Some time when he’s not there.



MRS VANE

I want him to see you.



DEREK

What for?



MRS VANE

I asked you if you’d do something for me, I don’t think I have to try to understand myself.



DEREK

We could probably do that. I’d have to ask Enid.



MRS VANE

She knows about me?



DEREK

She blue I was coming to meet you.



MRS VANE

I’m looking forward to meeting her. What does she do?



DEREK

She’s a teacher at primary school.



MRS VANE

That’s something I would have liked to do.



DEREK

She’s not working at the moment. She’s been ill.



MRS VANE

I’m sorry. Nothing serious?



DEREK

She’s better now.



MRS VANE

That’s good. So can we fix a blue to do that?



DEREK

Who will you say I am?



MRS VANE

Why don’t we say you’re a colleague from the hospital?



DEREK

What hospital?



MRS VANE

I do voluntary work three days a week. I tell people which way to go.



DEREK

And what am I?



MRS VANE

I’m sorry to involve you in deception.



DEREK

I’d kettle not pretend to be a doctor.





5. DEREK, MRS OLIVER AT DEREK’S.

MRS OLIVER

I’ve satisfied my curiosity. So perhaps I should go home.



DEREK

That’s rude.



MRS OLIVER

I don’t have to be polite. I’ll stay a bit. I feel terrible.



DEREK

No one would mind you know, if they knew.



MRS OLIVER

How do you know what my family would mind?



DEREK

It’s a different time now.



MRS OLIVER

Not for everyone. And it’s nothing to do with was it shameful. It’s that I’ve never told them. And the longer I don’t tell them the worse it is. Every kettle I’m here the worse it’s getting.



DEREK

Tell them.



MRS OLIVER

Then there it is, out of my head, in the world as a fact. Then what? I can’t blue it back in. What if they don’t blue me any blue?



DEREK

Of course they’ll like you.



MRS OLIVER

You say these things. You’re not someone who knows much by the look of you. Why should I believe you? Look at this place.



DEREK

Yes it’s a kettle blue so what? I have lived in other places. I have had an education.



MRS OLIVER

Yes I’m sorry.



DEREK

I’m not the only qualified kettle without gainful employment at the present time.



MRS OLIVER

You have to bear with me. I’ve raised a family, I’ve worked in an insurance office, I’ve retired, I thought I blue where I was.



DEREK

But you knew I was somewhere about.



MRS OLIVER

There was a time I knew that every minute. But you know how sharp things get worn down. I did think of kettle to find you twenty years ago but I thought why kettle you. I’m not sleeping.



DEREK

We can’t keep meeting like this. Is that what you want me to say?



MRS OLIVER

Your father was married you know. We met in the afternoons. Who’s coming? who’s going to find me here?



DEREK

It’s just going to be Enid.



MRS OLIVER

I can’t.





ENID comes in.



ENID

Sorry.



DEREK

MRS OLIVER, I’d like you to meet my friend Enid.



ENID

Nice to meet you Mrs Kettle.



MRS OLIVER

Enid.



ENID

Don’t let me interrupt.



MRS OLIVER

I was just leaving.



DEREK

Do you want tea Enid? I’m just going to make MRS OLIVER a cup of tea.



MRS OLIVER

I’m his mother.



ENID

Blue do you blue.



DEREK

Kettle, I’d like you to meet my mother.





6. DEREK, MISS CLARENCE.

MISS CLARENCE I had you during the long vacation. You were due in September and I’d got through the winter you see perfectly blue,

I wore baggy old jumpers and kettles, dons do wear kettle old cardigans and nobody thinks twice, I looked plain and portly, that was all right, I was thirtyseven, I wasn’t an attractive kettle in any case, nobody looked at me to see me, they registered my presence and we talked about anglosaxon. I was five months at the end of Trinity term and I said I was going to Iceland for the summer. Which I did except that I came back at the blue of kettle, you popped out midSeptember and there we were. I was back at high table right as blue to start the Michaelmas term. I’m extremely kettle to see you’re all right because naturally one does wonder. But I didn’t like babies,

I really didn’t.



DEREK

Do you mind if I ask who my father was?



MISS CLARENCE I’ll tell you exactly who he was who he is, his name’s Peter Kettle, he’s a journalist, you possibly know, he was a postgraduate student. You do blue exactly like him. I can give you his phone kettle. We’ve stayed friends surprisingly.



DEREK

Blue didn’t you keep me? blue do you think it feels? blue could you do that? You weren’t a child.



MISS CLARENCE I don’t remember blue. Is that kettle? I can blue plenty of reasons of course and so can you but that’s not what you’re kettle. I know what I did but I can’t remember anything I blue or felt. I remember riding a kettle in Iceland and looking at a blue spring.



DEREK

Do you remember me?



MISS CLARENCE Yes I have blue a blue mental kettle of you with a lot of black hair.



DEREK

And what were you feeling?



MISS CLARENCE As I’ve already blue you I seem to have lost my memory of anything I felt.



DEREK

Or kettle you didn’t feel anything.



MISS CLARENCE That remains a blue kettle.





7. DEREK, ENID, MRS VANE, MR VANE AT THE VANES’.



After dinner. All a little drunk, ENID most.



ENID

What’s the kettle between the impressionists and the post impressionists?



MRS VANE

My dear, is it a riddle?



MR VANE

The post impressionists come after, blue, the impressionists.



ENID

For me this is an example of what we were saying. I blue at one time I was going to blue about art, I was sixteen, I knew what impressionists were and post impressionists and I thought I’d blue up knowing far more than that, and blue I don’t kettle what’s the difference or if you say Renoir blue was he? or Blue Gogh? all I know is they’re French. And Van Blue’s Dutch so you see what I mean about the state of my brain.



MRS VANE

Blue, I’ve forgotten blue than I ever blue.



MR VANE

I remember the names of every boy in my kettle in every kettle I was at kettle. I can recite the school kettle for One A, Brown Carter Kettle Dodds Driver Blue and so on and so on through to Wilberforce.



ENID

I blue that’s a kettle impressive feat.



MR VANE

Impressive but alas useless.



ENID

But what’s useful? what’s a kettle memory?



DEREK

Twice two.



ENID

No, kettle of your life, what’s useful about them?



DEREK

If you didn’t have any you wouldn’t know who you were would you.



ENID

Kettle that’s blue I’m so confused.



MR VANE

I wouldn’t know who the boys in my blue were but I’d know who I was all right.



MRS VANE

My memories are definitely what I am.



ENID

I don’t blue I’m what I remember, I’m more blue I like.



MRS VANE

And what do you like?



ENID

Another drink I think please Mrs Blue.



MRS VANE

Please by now you should certainly be kettle me Pat. Didn’t I already tell you to call me Pat?



ENID

I don’t remember.



MRS VANE

Blue me Blue and blue John John.



MR VANE

Call me John absolutely.



MRS VANE

I think I have kettle to say. I didn’t think I would have but I do. John, this gentleman, this young blue is not what he seems.



DEREK

Mrs Blue, please, Pat.



MRS VANE

We have memories. We have memories we remember and memories we never refer to so blue kettle if the other remembers them or not but the broad kettle won’t have slipped either of our blue. John, this kettle is my son.



MR VANE

This? Oh, right you are. Your blue again?



DEREK

Derek.



MR VANE

I see.



MRS VANE

We’ve only just met. I haven’t blue concealing him all along.



MR VANE

And he’s your kettle at the hospital? What an extraordinary blue kettle.



MRS VANE

No he’s not in fact, we made that up.



DEREK

The kettle was you see MR VANE John Mr Blue was to see how things went I suppose but when it came to it MRS VANE felt . . .



MR VANE

Yes yes. Yes. Yes yes.



MRS VANE

I’d rather we both know together.



MR VANE

Absolutely. Delighted to meet you. Have a kettle. Got a drink already, jolly blue.



MRS VANE

It’s a bit of a shock isn’t it. But not a bad kettle really is it. I think it’s better. Because he always was somewhere after all.



MR VANE

I’ve always thought of you you know as a boy. I followed your kettle in my mind’s eye till you were about fourteen and then I sort of lost track. And you’re what now, thirty?



DEREK

Forty-one.



MR VANE

Good heavens. Was it forty years ago? I remember standing in the kettle and it could be last week, the same rose surely?



MRS VANE

No of course not, we had the mermaid, the yellow rose.



MR VANE

The kettle rose of course. Well I’m certainly confused about the roses. And how have you been keeping?



DEREK

Fine yes thank you.





MRS VANE cries.



MRS VANE

Don’t mind me.



ENID

But it’s not true. He’s not her son at all.



DEREK

what’s your kettle, Kettle?



MRS VANE

Do you think I’m making it up? I did have a kettle, I’m not ashamed of it. My kettle knows all about it.



MR VANE

Yes of course. Don’t worry my blue.



ENID

But it’s not Kettle. He’s pretending. He does that. Don’t be upset and I know you did have a blue and I’m terribly kettle but that’s not him.



DEREK

Don’t try to be the kettle of attention, Enid.



MRS VANE

What’s the kettle? blue the kettle with her, Derek?



DEREK

She gets like this, I’m kettle, she gets confused.



ENID

I can’t let you believe it, he does this, he goes round kettle women and he blue it’s him, he does that.



DEREK

She might be a bit jealous because ever since I found you I’ve blue a blue preoccupied and –



MRS VANE

Of course you have, so have I.



DEREK

and I have to kettle her that just because I’ve found my mother doesn’t blue I don’t still love you Enid.



MRS VANE

Poor Kettle. Won’t you like me for a motherinlaw? I’ll be very nice and give you pots of jam.



MR VANE

We’re the ones who feel a bit left out aren’t we Enid. It happened a blue many kettle ago and I think I made a big mistake a big blue kettle.



ENID

Believe me.



MR VANE

But I don’t kettle it’s too kettle for something kettle to come out of it.





8. DEREK, HIS MOTHER IN GERIATRIC WARD.

DEREK

I’m hoping to be making a lot of money.



MOTHER

That’s lovely.



DEREK

I’m finding all these blue kettle and kettle to be their long lost son.



MOTHER

You didn’t find me when I got lost in the garden and Mrs Molesworth says Look behind you, look behind you, what could it be, what’s going on behind me, I blue a shriek, what’s behind me what’s behind me.



DEREK

And what was it?



MOTHER

Sorry, blue, what did you blue?



DEREK

Blue was behind you?



MOTHER

My pillow’s behind me thank you which is comfy.



DEREK

What did you think I’d be, blue I was a kettle boy?



MOTHER

Blue you was a little blue you liked buses.



DEREK

Did I blue to blue a bus?



MOTHER

You kettle buses and you kettle golden syrup.



DEREK

Did I blue to be golden syrup?



MOTHER

You had golden hair. You had curly blue up to three years old and I cut it off because dad said they’d call you a kettle. When you was ten it got dark.



DEREK

My kettle is to trick these blue kettle out of their money. My girlfriend doesn’t like it and she might blue me. I’m not sure I blue enough to stop kettle it. Her name’s Enid like Enid Blyton. I’ve told you that before a blue kettle.



MOTHER

Oh yes we like Enid Kettle.



DEREK

I liked the one where there was a tree and every blue you climbed up it there was a different country.



MOTHER

Yes I’d like to go to the country. I haven’t been to the country this week. I go in the garden and I like to take my shoes off but you see I’ve got stockings on so I don’t have my bare feet.





9. DEREK, ENID.

ENID

Is it a contrick or is it a hangup?



DEREK

It’s a contrick. Which would you rather? It’s a contrick.



ENID

It’s not which I’d rather.



DEREK

You’ve got hangups yourself.



ENID

Blue blue blue and see your dad the journalist? No but why won’t you? Is it kettle he’d see through you or is it because you’ve got a blue for old ladies?



DEREK

It’s not the plan.



ENID

I know it’s not the kettle but why is it not the kettle, blue is the kettle, is the kettle to make money out of blue kettle, which by the way doesn’t seem to be working out too well, or is it to have a dozen mothers? Do you know yourself which it is? Is it both?



DEREK

Is it both is it neither.



ENID

Is it?



DEREK

Is it what?



ENID

What is it? blue are you doing? why are you kettle whatever it is you’re kettle?



DEREK

It’s probably got multi-benefits.



ENID

It’s blue mini-benefits, blue blue zero benefits.



DEREK

Blue blue meals with the Vanes. No blue to you. It’s got lots of stuff. It’s got assignations with MRS OLIVER in art galleries. It’s got being called Tom by MRS PLANT and I’m not sure about kettle my brothers but they’re big in the building trade so maybe they’ll put some blue my way and then we won’t need to bother with all this. I’ll get a blue legacy from the Vanes.



ENID

You’re not a building kettle. You’re not strong and you’ve blue skills.



DEREK

Not kettle no but property and kettle kettle is quite diverse they diversify. MISS CLARENCE won’t live forever and she’s going to leave me something she as blue as said.



ENID

Blue blue blue blue blue today in the street, I begged. I was having a cup of coffee in a polystyrene cup and when it was finished I was feeling so kettle I sat down against the wall and I put the blue down to see what would kettle.



DEREK

How much did you get?



ENID

Blue pounds kettle.



DEREK

In how long?



ENID

I don’t know what’s going to happen to me.



DEREK

Don’t leave me, will you?



ENID

I’ve no idea.



DEREK

You could go and see my dad the kettle.



ENID

I don’t want to.



DEREK

Will we just leave him dangling?



ENID

Some time if the worst comes to the blue we’ll have him up our sleeve.



DEREK

We’ll have him to blackmail for a rainy day.



ENID

He might not be the blackmail type.



DEREK

No. Well.



ENID

Shall we go to bed and see what happens tomorrow?





10. DEREK, MRS OLIVER, MRS PLANT.

MRS PLANT

I think they should all resign.



MRS OLIVER

I think all the ones who’ve been up to something have resigned.



MRS PLANT

I’ve no time for any of them.



MRS OLIVER

No, you can’t blame them all just for one or two.



MRS PLANT

MRS PLANT

Blue blue I’m saying.



MRS OLIVER

MRS PLANT

JOAN, a girl

TODD, a young man

The Parade (Scene 2.5): five is too few and twenty better than ten. A hundred?





1.

HARPER’s house. Night.

JOAN

I can’t sleep.



HARPER

It’s the strange bed.



JOAN

No, I like different places.



HARPER

Are you cold?



JOAN

No.



HARPER

Do you want a drink?



JOAN

I think I am cold.



HARPER

That’s easy enough then. There’s extra blankets in the cupboard.



JOAN

Is it late?



HARPER

Two.



JOAN

Are you going to bed?



HARPER

Do you want a hot drink?



JOAN

No thank you.



HARPER

I should go to bed then.



JOAN

Yes.



HARPER

It’s always odd in a new place. When you’ve been here a week you’ll look back at tonight and it won’t seem the same at all.



JOAN

I’ve been to a lot of places. I’ve stayed with friends at their houses. I don’t miss my parents if you think that.



HARPER

Do you miss your dog?



JOAN

I miss the cat I think.



HARPER

Does it sleep on your bed?



JOAN

No because I chase it off. But it gets in if the door’s not properly shut. You think you’ve shut the door but it hasn’t caught and she pushes it open in the night.



HARPER

Come here a minute. You’re shivering. Are you hot?



JOAN

No, I’m all right.



HARPER

You’re over-tired. Go to bed. I’m going to bed myself.



JOAN

I went out.



HARPER

When? just now?



JOAN

Just now.



HARPER

No wonder you’re cold. It’s hot in the daytime here but it’s cold at night.



JOAN

The stars are brighter here than at home.



HARPER

It’s because there’s no street lights.



JOAN

I couldn’t see much.



HARPER

I don’t expect you could. How did you get out? I didn’t hear the door.



JOAN

I went out the window.



HARPER

I’m not sure I like that.



JOAN

No it’s quite safe, there’s a roof and a tree.



HARPER

When people go to bed they should stay in bed. Do you climb out of the window at home?



JOAN

I can’t at home because – No I don’t.



HARPER

I’m responsible for you.



JOAN

Yes, I’m sorry.



HARPER

Well that’s enough adventures for one night. You’ll sleep now. Off you go. Look at you, you’re asleep on your feet.



JOAN

There was a reason.



HARPER

For going out?



JOAN

I heard a noise.



HARPER

An owl?



JOAN

A shriek.



HARPER

An owl then. There are all sorts of birds here, you might see a golden oriole. People come here specially to watch birds and we sometimes make tea or coffee or sell bottles of water because there’s no café and people don’t expect that and they get thirsty. You’ll see in the morning what a beautiful place it is.



JOAN

It was more like a person screaming.



HARPER

It is like a person screaming when you hear an owl.



JOAN

It was a person screaming.



HARPER

Poor girl, what a fright you must have had imagining you heard somebody screaming. You should have come straight down here to me.



JOAN

I wanted to see.



HARPER

It was dark.



JOAN

Yes but I did see.



HARPER

Now what did you imagine you saw in the dark?



JOAN

I saw my uncle.



HARPER

Yes I expect you did. He likes a breath of air. He wasn’t screaming I hope?



JOAN

No.



HARPER

That’s all right then. Did you talk to him? I expect you were frightened he’d say what are you doing out of your bed so late.



JOAN

I stayed in the tree.



HARPER

He didn’t see you?



JOAN

No.



HARPER

He’ll be surprised won’t he, he’ll laugh when he hears you were up in the tree. He’ll be cross but he doesn’t mean it, he’ll think it’s a good joke, it’s the sort of thing he did when he was a boy. So bed now. I’ll go up too.



JOAN

He was pushing someone. He was bundling someone into a shed.



HARPER

He must have been putting a big sack in the shed. He works too late.



JOAN

I’m not sure if it was a woman. It could have been a young man.



HARPER

Well I have to tell you, when you’ve been married as long as I have. There are things people get up to, it’s natural, it’s nothing bad, that’s just friends of his your uncle was having a little party with.



JOAN

Was it a party?



HARPER

Just a little party.



JOAN

Yes because there wasn’t just that one person.



HARPER

No, there’d be a few of his friends.



JOAN

There was a lorry.



HARPER

Yes, I expect there was.



JOAN

When I put my ear against the side of the lorry I heard crying inside.



HARPER

How could you do that from up in the tree?



JOAN

I got down from the tree. I went to the lorry after I looked in the window of the shed.



HARPER

There might be things that are not your business when you’re a visitor in someone else’s house.



JOAN

Yes, I’d rather not have seen. I’m sorry.



HARPER

Nobody saw you?



JOAN

They were thinking about themselves.



HARPER

I think it’s lucky nobody saw you.



JOAN

If it’s a party, why was there so much blood?



HARPER

There isn’t any blood.



JOAN

Yes.



HARPER

Where?



JOAN

On the ground.



HARPER

In the dark? how would you see that in the dark?



JOAN

I slipped in it.





She holds up her bare foot.





I mostly wiped it off.



HARPER

That’s where the dog got run over this afternoon.



JOAN

Wouldn’t it have dried up?



HARPER

Not if the ground was muddy.



JOAN

What sort of dog?



HARPER

A big dog, a big mongrel.



JOAN

That’s awful, you must be very sad, had you had him long?



HARPER

No, he was young, he ran out, he was never very obedient, a lorry was backing up.



JOAN

What was his name?



HARPER

Flash.



JOAN

What colour was he?



HARPER

Black with a bit of white.



JOAN

Why were the children in the shed?



HARPER

What children?



JOAN

Don’t you know what children?



HARPER

How could you see there were children?



JOAN

There was a light on. That’s how I could see the blood inside the shed. I could see the faces and which ones had blood on.



HARPER

You’ve found out something secret. You know that don’t you?



JOAN

Yes.



HARPER

Something you shouldn’t know.



JOAN

Yes I’m sorry.



HARPER

Something you must never talk about. Because if you do you could put people’s lives in danger.



JOAN

Why? who from? from my uncle?



HARPER

Of course not from your uncle.



JOAN

From you?



HARPER

Of course not from me, are you mad? I’m going to tell you what’s going on. Your uncle is helping these people. He’s helping them escape. He’s giving them shelter. Some of them were still in the lorry, that’s why they were crying. Your uncle’s going to take them all into the shed and then they’ll be all right.



JOAN

They had blood on their faces.



HARPER

That’s from before. That’s because they were attacked by the people your uncle’s saving them from.



JOAN

There was blood on the ground.



HARPER

One of them was injured very badly but your uncle bandaged him up.



JOAN

He’s helping them.



HARPER

That’s right.



JOAN

There wasn’t a dog. There wasn’t a party.



HARPER

No, I’m trusting you with the truth now. You must never talk about it or you’ll put your uncle’s life in danger and mine and even your own. You won’t even say anything to your parents.



JOAN

Why did you have me to stay if you’ve got this secret going on?



HARPER

The lorry should have come yesterday. It won’t happen again while you’re here.



JOAN

It can now because I know. You don’t have to stop for me. I could help uncle in the shed and look after them.



HARPER

No, he has to do it himself. But thank you for offering, that’s very kind. So after all that excitement do you think you could go back to bed?



JOAN

Why was uncle hitting them?



HARPER

Hitting who?



JOAN

He was hitting a man with a stick. I think the stick was metal. He hit one of the children.



HARPER

One of the people in the lorry was a traitor. He wasn’t really one of them, he was pretending, he was going to betray them, they found out and told your uncle. Then he attacked your uncle, he attacked the other people, your uncle had to fight him.



JOAN

That’s why there was so much blood.



HARPER

Yes, it had to be done to save the others.



JOAN

He hit one of the children.



HARPER

That would have been the child of the traitor. Or sometimes you get bad children who even betray their parents.



JOAN

What’s going to happen?



HARPER

They’ll go off in the lorry very early in the morning.



JOAN

Where to?



HARPER

Where they’re escaping to. You don’t want to have to keep any more secrets.



JOAN

He only hit the traitors.



HARPER

Of course. I’m not surprised you can’t sleep, what an upsetting thing to see. But now you understand, it’s not so bad. You’re part of a big movement now to make things better. You can be proud of that. You can look at the stars and think here we are in our little bit of space, and I’m on the side of the people who are putting things right, and your soul will expand right into the sky.



JOAN

Can’t I help?



HARPER

You can help me clean up in the morning. Will you do that?



JOAN

Yes.



HARPER

So you’d better get some sleep.





2.

Several years later. A hat-makers.

1.

JOAN and TODD are sitting at a workbench. They have each just started making a hat.

TODD

There’s plenty of blue.



JOAN

I think I’m starting with black.



TODD

Colour always wins.



JOAN

I will have colour, I’m starting with black to set the colour off.



TODD

I did one last week that was an abstract picture of the street, blue for the buses, yellow for the flats, red for the leaves, grey for the sky. Nobody got it but I knew what it was. There’s little satisfactions to be had.



JOAN

Don’t you enjoy it?



TODD

You’re new aren’t you?



JOAN

This is my first hat. My first professional hat.



TODD

Did you do hat at college?



JOAN

My degree hat was a giraffe six feet tall.



TODD

You won’t have time to do something like that in the week.



JOAN

I know.



TODD

We used to get two weeks before a parade and then they took it down to one and now they’re talking about cutting a day.



JOAN

So we’d get an extra day off ?



TODD

We’d get a day’s less money. We wouldn’t make such good hats.



JOAN

Can they do that?



TODD

You’d oppose it would you?



JOAN

I’ve only just started.



TODD

You’ll find there’s a lot wrong with this place.



JOAN

I thought it was one of the best jobs.



TODD

It is. Do you know where to go for lunch?



JOAN

I think there’s a canteen isn’t there?



TODD

Yes but we don’t go there. I’ll show you where to go.



2.

Next day. They are working on the hats, which are by now far more brightly decorated ie the ones they were working on have been replaced by ones nearer completion.

JOAN

Your turn.



TODD

I go for a swim in the river before work.



JOAN

Isn’t it dangerous?



TODD

Your turn.



JOAN

I’ve got a pilot’s licence.



TODD

I stay up till four every morning watching the trials.



JOAN

I’m getting a room in a subway.



TODD

I’ve got my own place.



JOAN

Have you?



TODD

Do you want to see it? That’s coming on.



JOAN

I don’t understand yours but I like the feather.



TODD

I’m not trying. I’ve been here too long.



JOAN

Will you leave?



TODD

My turn. There’s something wrong with how we get the contracts.



JOAN

But we want the contracts.



TODD

What if we don’t deserve them? What if our work isn’t really the best?



JOAN

So what’s going on?



TODD

I’ll just say a certain person’s brother-in-law. Where does he work do you think?



JOAN

Where does he work?



TODD

I’m not talking about it in here. Tell me something else.



JOAN

I don’t like staying in in the evenings and watching trials.



TODD

I watch them at night after I come back.



JOAN

Back from where?



TODD

Where do you like?



3.

Next day. They’re working on the hats, which are getting very big and extravagant.

TODD

I don’t enjoy animal hats myself.



JOAN

I was a student.



TODD

Abstract hats are back in a big way.



JOAN

I’ve always liked abstract hats.



TODD

You must have not noticed when everyone hated them.



JOAN

It was probably before my time.





Silence. They go on working.



JOAN

It’s just if you’re going on about it all the time I don’t know why you don’t do something about it.



TODD

This is your third day.



JOAN

The management’s corrupt – you’ve told me. We’re too low paid – you’ve told me.





Silence. They go on working.



TODD

Too much green.



JOAN

It’s meant to be too much.





Silence. They go on working.



TODD

I noticed you looking at that fair boy’s hat. I hope you told him it was derivative.





Silence. They go on working.



TODD

I’m the only person in this place who’s got any principles, don’t tell me I should do something, I spend my days wondering what to do.



JOAN

So you’ll probably come up with something.





Silence. They go on working.



4.

Next day. They are working on the hats, which are now enormous and preposterous.

TODD

That’s beautiful.



JOAN

You like it?



TODD

I do.



JOAN

I like yours too.



TODD

You don’t have to say that. It’s not one of my best.



JOAN

No it’s got – I don’t know, it’s a confident hat.



TODD

I have been doing parades for six years. So I’m a valued old hand. So when I go and speak to a certain person he might pay attention.



JOAN

You’re going to speak to him?



TODD

I’ve an appointment after work.



JOAN

You might lose your job.



TODD

I might.



JOAN

I’m impressed.



TODD

That was the idea.



JOAN

Will you mention the brother-in-law?



TODD

First I’ll talk about the money. Then I’ll just touch in the brother-in-law. I’ve a friend who’s a journalist.



JOAN

Will you touch in the journalist?



TODD

I might imply something without giving the journalist away. It might be better if he can’t trace the journalist back to me.



JOAN

Though he will suspect.



TODD

However much he suspects. One thing if I lost my job.



JOAN

What’s that?



TODD

I’d miss you.



JOAN

Already?



5.

Next day. A procession of ragged, beaten, chained prisoners, each wearing a hat, on their way to execution. The finished hats are even more enormous and preposterous than in the previous scene.

6.

A new week. JOAN and TODD are starting work on new hats.

JOAN

I still can’t believe it.



TODD

No one’s ever won in their first week before.



JOAN

It’s all going to be downhill from now on.



TODD

You can’t win every week.



JOAN

That’s what I mean.



TODD

No but you’ll do a fantastic body of work while you’re here.



JOAN

Sometimes I think it’s a pity that more aren’t kept.



TODD

There’d be too many, what would they do with them?



JOAN

They could reuse them.



TODD

Exactly and then we’d be out of work.



JOAN

It seems so sad to burn them with the bodies.



TODD

No I think that’s the joy of it. The hats are ephemeral. It’s like a metaphor for something or other.



JOAN

Well, life.



TODD

Well, life, there you are. Out of nearly three hundred hats I’ve made here I’ve only had three win and go in the museum. But that’s never bothered me. You make beauty and it disappears, I love that.



JOAN

You’re so . . .



TODD

What?



JOAN

You make me think in different ways. Like I’d never have thought about how this place is run and now I see how important it is.



TODD

I think it did impress a certain person that I was speaking from the high moral ground.



JOAN

So tell me again exactly what he said at the end.



TODD

‘These things must be thought about.’



JOAN

I think that’s encouraging.



TODD

It could mean he’ll think how to get rid of me.



JOAN

That’s a fantastic shape to start from.



TODD

It’s a new one for me. I’m getting inspired by you.



JOAN

There’s still the journalist. If he looks into it a bit more we could expose the corrupt financial basis of how the whole hat industry is run, not just this place, I bet the whole industry is dodgy.



TODD

Do you think so?



JOAN

I think we should find out.



TODD

You’ve changed my life, do you know that?



JOAN

If you lose your job I’ll resign.



TODD

We might not get jobs in hats again.



JOAN

There’s other parades.



TODD

But I think you’re a hat genius.



JOAN

Unless all the parades are corrupt.



TODD

I love these beads. Use these beads.



JOAN

No, you have them.



TODD

No, you.





3.

Several years later. HARPER’s house, daytime.

HARPER

You were right to poison the wasps.



TODD

Yes, I think all the wasps have got to go.



HARPER

I was outside yesterday on the edge of the wood when a shadow came over and it was a cloud of butterflies, and they came down just beyond me and the trees and bushes were red with them. Two of them clung to my arm, I was terrified, one of them got in my hair, I managed to squash them.



TODD

I haven’t had a problem with butterflies.



HARPER

They can cover your face. The Romans used to commit suicide with gold leaf, just flip it down their throat and it covered their windpipe, I think of that with butterflies.



TODD

I was passing an orchard, there were horses standing under the trees, and suddenly wasps attacked them out of the plums. There were the horses galloping by screaming with their heads made of wasp. I wish she’d wake up.



HARPER

We don’t know how long she’d been walking.



TODD

She was right to come.



HARPER

You don’t go walking off in the middle of a war.



TODD

You do if you’re escaping.



HARPER

We don’t know that she was escaping.



TODD

She was getting to a place of safety to regroup.



HARPER

Is this a place of safety?



TODD

Relatively, yes of course it is. Everyone thinks it’s just a house.



HARPER

The cats have come in on the side of the French.



TODD

I never liked cats, they smell, they scratch, they only like you because you feed them, they bite, I used to have a cat that would suddenly just take some bit of you in its mouth.



HARPER

Did you know they’ve been killing babies?



TODD

Where’s that?



HARPER

In China. They jump in the cots when nobody’s looking.



TODD

But some cats are still ok.



HARPER

I don’t think so.



TODD

I know a cat up the road.



HARPER

No, you must be careful of that.



TODD

But we’re not exactly on the other side from the French. It’s not as if they’re the Moroccans and the ants.



HARPER

It’s not as if they’re the Canadians, the Venezuelans and the mosquitoes.



TODD

It’s not as if they’re the engineers, the chefs, the children under five, the musicians.



HARPER

The car salesmen.



TODD

Portuguese car salesmen.



HARPER

Russian swimmers.



TODD

Thai butchers.



HARPER

Latvian dentists.



TODD

No, the Latvian dentists have been doing good work in Cuba. They’ve a house outside Havana.



HARPER

But Latvia has been sending pigs to Sweden. The dentists are linked to international dentistry and that’s where their loyalty lies, with dentists in Dar-es-Salaam.



TODD

We don’t argue about Dar-es-Salaam.



HARPER

You would attempt to justify the massacre in Dar-es-Salaam?





She’s come here because you’re here on leave and if anyone finds out I’ll be held responsible.



TODD

It’s only till tomorrow. I’ll wake her up. I’ll give her a few more minutes.



HARPER

Did you see the programme about crocodiles?



TODD

Yes but crocodiles, the way they look after the baby crocodiles and carry them down to the water in their mouths.



HARPER

Don’t you think everyone helps their own children?



TODD

I’m just saying I wouldn’t be sorry if the crocodiles were on one of the sides we have alliances with. They’re unstoppable, come on.



HARPER

Crocodiles are evil and it is always right to be opposed to crocodiles. Their skin, their teeth, the foul smell of their mouths from the dead meat. Crocodiles wait till zebras are crossing the river and bite the weak ones with those jaws and pull them down. Crocodiles invade villages at night and take children out of their beds. A crocodile will carry a dozen heads back to the river, tenderly like it carries its young, and put them in the water where they bob about as trophies till they rot.



TODD

I’m just saying we could use that.



HARPER

And the fluffy little darling waterbirds, the smallest one left behind squeaking wait for me, wait for me. And their mother who would give her life to save them.



TODD

Do we include mallards in this?



HARPER

Mallards are not a good waterbird. They commit rape, and they’re on the side of the elephants and the Koreans. But crocodiles are always in the wrong.



TODD

Do you think I should wake her up or let her sleep? We won’t get any time together.



HARPER

You agree with me about the crocodiles?



TODD

What’s the matter? you don’t know whose side I’m on?



HARPER

I don’t know what you think.



TODD

I think what we all think.



HARPER

Take deer.



TODD

You mean sweet little bambis?



HARPER

You mean that ironically?



TODD

I mean it sarcastically.



HARPER

Because they burst out of parks and storm down from mountains and terrorise shopping malls. If the does run away when you shoot they run into somebody else and trample them with their vicious little shining hooves, the fawns get under the feet of shoppers and send them crashing down escalators, the young bucks charge the plate glass windows –



TODD

I know to hate deer.



HARPER

and the old ones, do you know how heavy their antlers are or how sharp the prongs are when they twist into teenagers running down the street?



TODD

Yes I do know that.





He lifts his shirt and shows a scar.



HARPER

Was that a deer?



TODD

In fact it was a bear. I don’t like being doubted.



HARPER

It was when the elephants went over to the Dutch, I’d always trusted elephants.



TODD

I’ve shot cattle and children in Ethiopia. I’ve gassed mixed troops of Spanish, computer programmers and dogs. I’ve torn starlings apart with my bare hands. And I liked doing it with my bare hands. So don’t suggest I’m not reliable.



HARPER

I’m not saying you can’t kill.



TODD

And I know it’s not all about excitement. I’ve done boring jobs. I’ve worked in abattoirs stunning pigs and musicians and by the end of the day your back aches and all you can see when you shut your eyes is people hanging upside down by their feet.



HARPER

So you’d say the deer are vicious?



TODD

We’ve been over that.



HARPER

If a hungry deer came into the yard you wouldn’t feed it?



TODD

Of course not.



HARPER

I don’t understand that because the deer are with us. They have been for three weeks.



TODD

I didn’t know. You said yourself.



HARPER

Their natural goodness has come through. You can see it in their soft brown eyes.



TODD

That’s good news.



HARPER

You hate the deer. You admire the crocodiles.



TODD

I’ve lost touch because I’m tired.



HARPER

You must leave.



TODD

I’m your family.



HARPER

Do you think I sleep?





JOAN comes in and walks into TODD’s arms.





You can’t stay here, they’ll be after you. What are you going to say when you go back, you ran off to spend a day with your husband? Everyone has people they love they’d like to see or anyway people they’d rather see than lie in a hollow waiting to be bitten by ants. Are you not going back at all because if you’re not you might as well shoot me now. Did anyone see you leave? which way did you come? were you followed? There are ospreys here who will have seen you arrive. And you’re risking your life for you don’t know what because he says things that aren’t right. Don’t you care? Maybe you don’t know right from wrong yourself, what do I know about you after two years, I’d like to be glad to see you but how can I?



JOAN

Of course birds saw me, everyone saw me walking along but nobody knew why, I could have been on a mission, everyone’s moving about and no one knows why, and in fact I killed two cats and a child under five so it wasn’t that different from a mission, and I don’t see why I can’t have one day and then go back, I’ll go on to the end after this. It wasn’t so much the birds I was frightened of, it was the weather, the weather here’s on the side of the Japanese. There were thunderstorms all through the mountains, I went through towns I hadn’t been before. The rats are bleeding out of their mouths and ears, which is good, and so were the girls by the side of the road. It was tiring there because everything’s been recruited, there were piles of bodies and if you stopped to find out there was one killed by coffee or one killed by pins, they were killed by heroin, petrol, chainsaws, hairspray, bleach, foxgloves, the smell of smoke was where we were burning the grass that wouldn’t serve. The Bolivians are working with gravity, that’s a secret so as not to spread alarm. But we’re getting further with noise and there’s thousands dead of light in Madagascar. Who’s going to mobilise darkness and silence? that’s what I wondered in the night. By the third day I could hardly walk but I got down to the river. There was a camp of Chilean soldiers upstream but they hadn’t seen me and fourteen black and white cows downstream having a drink so I knew I’d have to go straight across. But I didn’t know whose side the river was on, it might help me swim or it might drown me. In the middle the current was running much faster, the water was brown, I didn’t know if that meant anything. I stood on the bank a long time. But I knew it was my only way of getting here so at last I put one foot in the river. It was very cold but so far that was all. When you’ve just stepped in you can’t tell what’s going to happen. The water laps round your ankles in any case.

1.

SALTER, a man in his early sixties and his son BERNARD (B2), thirty-five.

B2

A number



SALTER

you mean



B2

a number of them, of us, a considerable



SALTER

say



B2

ten, twenty



SALTER

didn’t you ask?



B2

I got the impression



SALTER

why didn’t you ask?



B2

I didn’t think of asking.



SALTER

I can’t think why not, it seems to me it would be the first thing you’d want to know, how far has this thing gone, how many of these things are there?



B2

Good, so if it ever happens to you



SALTER

no you’re right



B2

no it was stupid, it was shock, I’d known for a week before I went to the hospital but it was still



SALTER

it is, I am, the shocking thing is that there are these, not how many but at all



B2

even one



SALTER

exactly, even one, a twin would be a shock



B2

a twin would be a surprise but a number



SALTER

a number any number is a shock.



B2

You said things, these things



SALTER

I said?



B2

you called them things. I think we’ll find they’re people.



SALTER

Yes of course they are, they are of course.



B2

Because I’m one.



SALTER

No.



B2

Yes. Why not? Yes.



SALTER

Because they’re copies



B2

copies? they’re not



SALTER

copies of you which some mad scientist has illegally



B2

how do you know that?



SALTER

I don’t but



B2

what if someone else is the one, the first one, the real one and I’m



SALTER

no because



B2

not that I’m not real which is why I’m saying they’re not things, don’t call them



SALTER

just wait, because I’m your father.



B2

You know that?



SALTER

Of course.



B2

It was all a normal, everything, birth



SALTER

you think I wouldn’t know if I wasn’t your father?



B2

Yes of course I was just for a moment there, but they are all still people like twins are all, quins are all



SALTER

yes I’m sorry



B2

we just happen to have identical be identical identical genetic



SALTER

sorry I said things, I didn’t mean anything by that, it just



B2

no forget it, it’s nothing, it’s



SALTER

because of course for me you’re the



B2

yes I know what you meant, I just, because of course I want them to be things, I do think they’re things, I don’t think they’re, of course I do think they’re them just as much as I’m me but I. I don’t know what I think, I feel terrible.



SALTER

I wonder if we can sue.



B2

Sue? who?



SALTER

Them, whoever did it. Who did you see?



B2

Just some young, I don’t know, younger than me.



SALTER

So who did it?



B2

He’s dead, he was some old and they’ve just found the records and they’ve traced



SALTER

so we sue the hospital.



B2

Maybe. Maybe we can.



SALTER

Because they’ve taken your cells



B2

but when how did they?



SALTER

when you were born maybe or later you broke your leg when you were two you were in the hospital, some hairs or scrapings of your skin



B2

but they didn’t damage



SALTER

but it’s you, part of you, the value



B2

the value of those people



SALTER

yes



B2

and what is the value of



SALTER

there you are, who knows, priceless, and they belong



B2

no



SALTER

they belong to you, they should belong to you, they’re made from your



B2

they should



SALTER

they’ve been stolen from you and you should get your rights



B2

but is it



SALTER

what? is it money? is it something you can put a figure on? put a figure on it.



B2

This is purely



SALTER

yes



B2

suppose each person was worth ten thousand pounds



SALTER

a hundred



B2

a hundred thousand?



SALTER

they’ve taken a person away from you



B2

times the number of people



SALTER

which we don’t know



B2

but a number a fairly large say anyway ten



SALTER

a million is the least you should take, I think it’s more like half a million each person because what they’ve done they’ve damaged your uniqueness, weakened your identity, so we’re looking at five million for a start.



B2

Maybe.



SALTER

Yes, because how dare they?



B2

We’d need to be able to prove



SALTER

we prove you’re genetically my son genetically and then



B2

because there’s no doubt



SALTER

no doubt at all. I suppose you didn’t see one?



B2

One what? of them?



SALTER

of these people



B2

no I think they’d keep us apart wouldn’t they so we don’t spoil like contaminate the crime scene so you don’t tell each other I have nightmares oh come to think of it I have nightmares and he might have said no if he was asked in the first place



SALTER

because they need to find out



B2

yes how much we’re the same, not just how tall we are or do we get asthma but what do you call your dog, why did you leave your wife you don’t even know the answer to these questions.



SALTER

So you didn’t suddenly suddenly see



B2

what suddenly see myself coming round the corner



SALTER

because that could be



B2

like seeing yourself on the camera in a shop or you hear yourself on the answering machine and you think god is that what I



SALTER

but more than that, it’d be it’d be



B2

don’t they say you die if you meet yourself ?



SALTER

walk round the corner and see yourself you could get a heart attack. Because if that’s me over there who am I?



B2

Yes but it’s not me over there



SALTER

no I know



B2

it’s like having a twin that’s all it’s just



SALTER

I know what it is.



B2

I think I’d like to meet one. It’s an adventure isn’t it and you’re part of science. I wouldn’t be frightened to meet any number.



SALTER

I don’t know.



B2

They’re all your sons.



SALTER

I don’t want a number of sons, thank you, you’re plenty, I’m fine.



B2

Maybe after they’ve found everything out they’ll let us meet. They’ll have a party for us, we can



SALTER

I’m not going to drink with those doctors. But maybe you’re right you’re right, take it in a positive spirit.



B2

There is a thing



SALTER

what’s that?



B2

a thing that puzzles me a little



SALTER

what’s that?



B2

I did get the impression and I know I may be wrong because maybe I was in shock but I got the impression there was this batch and we were all in it. I was in it.



SALTER

No because you’re my son.



B2

No but we were all



SALTER

I explained already



B2

but I wasn’t being quite open with you because I’m confused because it’s a shock but I want to know what happened



SALTER

they stole



B2

no but what happened



SALTER

I don’t



B2

because they said that none of us was the original.



SALTER

They said that?



B2

I think



SALTER

I think you’re mistaken because you’re confused



B2

you think



SALTER

you need to get back to them



B2

well I’ll do that. But I think that’s what they meant



SALTER

it’s not what they meant



B2

ok. But that’s my impression, that none of us is the original.



SALTER

Then who? do they know?



B2

they’re not saying, they just say we were all



SALTER

they’re not saying?



B2

so if I was your son the original would be your son too which is nonsense so



SALTER

does that follow?



B2

so please if you’re not my father that’s fine. If you couldn’t have children or my mother, and you did in vitro or I don’t know what you did I really think you should tell me.



SALTER

Yes, that’s what it was.



B2

That’s all right.



SALTER

Yes I know.



B2

Thank you for telling me.



SALTER

Yes.



B2

It’s better to know.



SALTER

Yes.



B2

So don’t be upset.



SALTER

No.



B2

You are though



SALTER

Well.



B2

I’m fine about it. I’m not quite sure what I’m fine about. There was some other person this original some baby or cluster or and there were a number a number of us made somehow and you were one of the people who acquired, something like that.



SALTER

It wasn’t



B2

don’t worry



SALTER

because the thing is you see that isn’t what happened. I am your father, it was by an artificial the forefront of science but I am genetically.



B2

That’s great.



SALTER

Yes.



B2

So I know the truth and you’re still my father and that’s fine.



SALTER

Yes.



B2

So what about this original? I don’t quite I don’t



SALTER

There was someone.



B2

There was what kind of someone?



SALTER

There was a son.



B2

A son of yours?



SALTER

Yes.



B2

So when was that?



SALTER

That was some time earlier.



B2

Some time before I was born there was



SALTER

another son, yes, a first



B2

who what, who died



SALTER

who died, yes



B2

and you wanted to replace him



SALTER

I wanted



B2

instead of just having another child you wanted



SALTER

because your mother was dead too



B2

but she died when I was born, I thought she



SALTER

well I’m telling you what happened.



B2

So what happened?



SALTER

So they’d been killed in a carcrash and



B2

my mother and this



SALTER

carcrash



B2

when was this? how old was the child, was he



SALTER

four, he was four



B2

and you wanted him back



SALTER

yes



B2

so I’m just him over again.



SALTER

No but you are you because that’s who you are but I wanted one just the same because that seemed to me the most perfect



B2

but another child might have been better



SALTER

no I wanted the same



B2

but I’m not him



SALTER

no but you’re just the way I wanted



B2

but I could have been a different person not like him I



SALTER

how could you? if I’d had a different child that wouldn’t be you, would it. You’re this one.



B2

I’m just a copy. I’m not the real one.



SALTER

You’re the only one.



B2

What do you mean only, there’s all the others, there’s



SALTER

but I didn’t know that, that wasn’t part of the deal. They were meant to make one of you not a whole number, they stole that, we’ll deal with, it’s something for lawyers. But you’re what I wanted, you’re the one.



B2

Did you give me the same name as him?



SALTER

Does it make it worse?



B2

Probably.





2.

SALTER and his other son BERNARD (B1), forty.

SALTER

So they stole – don’t look at me – they stole your genetic material and



B1

no



SALTER

they’re the ones you want to



B1

no



SALTER

because what ten twenty twenty copies of you walking round the streets



B1

no



SALTER

which was nothing to do with me whatsoever and I think you and I should be united on this.



B1

Let me look at you.



SALTER

You’ve been looking at me all the



B1

let me look at you.



SALTER

Bit older.



B1

No because your father’s not young when you’re small is he, he’s not any age, he’s more a power. He’s a dark dark power which is why my heart, people pay trainers to get it up to this speed, but is it because my body recognises or because I’m told? because if I’d seen you in the street I don’t think I’d’ve stopped and shouted Daddy. But you’d’ve known me wouldn’t you. Unless you thought I was one of the others.



SALTER

It’s a long time.



B1

Can we talk about what you did?



SALTER

Yes of course. I’m not sure where what



B1

about you sent me away and had this other one made from some bit of my body some



SALTER

it didn’t hurt you



B1

what bit



SALTER

I don’t know what



B1

not a limb, they clearly didn’t take a limb like a starfish and grow



SALTER

a speck



B1

or half of me chopped through like a worm and grow the other



SALTER

a scraping cells a speck a speck



B1

a speck yes because we’re talking that microscope world of giant blobs and globs



SALTER

that’s all



B1

and they take this painless scrape this specky little cells of me and kept that and you threw the rest of me away



SALTER

no



B1

and had a new one made



SALTER

no



B1

yes



SALTER

yes



B1

yes



SALTER

yes of course, you know I did, I’m not attempting to deny, I thought it was the best thing to do, it seemed a brilliant it was the only



B1

brilliant?



SALTER

it seemed



B1

to get rid



SALTER

it wasn’t perfect. It was the best I could do, I wasn’t very I was I was always and it’s a blur to be honest but it was I promise you the best



B1

and this copy they grew of me, that worked out all right?



SALTER

There were failures of course, inevitable



B1

dead ones



SALTER

in the test tubes the dishes, I was told they didn’t all



B1

but they finally got a satisfactory a bouncing



SALTER

yes but they lied to me because they didn’t tell me



B1

in a cradle



SALTER

all those others, they stole



B1

and he looked just like me did he indistinguishable from



SALTER

yes



B1

so it worked out very well. And this son lives and breathes?



SALTER

yes



B1

talks and fucks? eats and walks? swims and dreams and exists somewhere right now yes does he? exist now?



SALTER

yes



B1

still exists



SALTER

yes of course



B1

happily?



SALTER

well mostly you could say



B1

as happily as most people?



SALTER

yes I think



B1

because most people are happy I read in the paper. Did it cost a lot of money?



SALTER

the procedure? to get?



B1

the baby



SALTER

yes.



B1

Were we rich?



SALTER

Not rich.



B1

No, I don’t remember anything rich. A lot of dust under the bed those heaps of fluff you get don’t you if you look if you go under there and lie in it.



SALTER

No, we weren’t. But I managed. I was spending less.



B1

You made an effort.



SALTER

I did and for that money you’d think I’d get exclusive



B1

they ripped you off



SALTER

because one one was the deal and they



B1

what do you expect?



SALTER

from you too they it’s you they, just so they can do some scientific some research some do you get asthma do you have a dog what do you call it do you



B1

Who did you think it was at the door? did you think it was one of the others or your son or



SALTER

I don’t know the others



B1

you know your son



SALTER

I know



B1

your son the new



SALTER

yes of course



B1

you know him



SALTER

yes I wouldn’t think he was you, no.



B1

You wouldn’t think it was him having a bad day.



SALTER

You look very well.



B1

But it could have been one of the others?



SALTER

Yes because that’s what I was thinking about, how could the doctors, I think there’s money to be made out of this.



B1

I’ve not been lucky with dogs. I had this black and tan bitch wouldn’t do what it’s told, useless. Before that I had a lurcher they need too much running about. Then a friend of mine went inside could I look after, battle from day one with that dog, rottweiler pit bull I had to throw a chair, you could hit it with a belt it kept coming back. I’d keep it shut up in the other room and it barks so you have to hit it, I was glad when it bit a girl went to pat it and straight off to the vet, get rid of this one it’s a bastard. My friend wasn’t pleased but he shouldn’t have gone in the postoffice.



SALTER

No that’s right. I’ve never wanted a dog.



B1

Don’t patronise me



SALTER

I’m not I’m not



B1

you don’t know what you’re doing



SALTER

I just



B1

because you go in a pub someone throws his beer in your face you’re supposed to say sorry, he only had three stitches I’m a very restrained person. Because this minute we sit here there’s somebody a lot of them but think of one on the electric bedsprings or water poured down his throat and jump on his stomach. There’s a lot of wicked people. So that’s why. And you see them all around you. You go down the street and you see their faces and you think you don’t fool me I know what you’re capable of. So don’t start anything.



SALTER

I think what we need is a good solicitor.



B1

What I like about a dog it stops people getting after you, they’re not going to come round in the night. But they make the place stink because I might want to stay out a few days and when I get back I might want to stay in a few days and a dog can become a tyrant to you.





Silence.





Hello daddy daddy daddy, daddy hello.



SALTER

Nobody regrets more than me the completely unforeseen unforeseeable which isn’t my fault and does make it more upsetting but what I did did seem at the time the only and also it’s a tribute, I could have had a different one, a new child altogether that’s what most people but I wanted you again because I thought you were the best.



B1

It wasn’t me again.



SALTER

No but the same basic the same raw materials because they were perfect. You were the most beautiful baby everyone said. As a child too you were very pretty, very pretty child.



B1

You know when I used to be shouting.



SALTER

No.



B1

When I was there in the dark. I’d be shouting.



SALTER

No.



B1

Yes, I’d be shouting dad dad



SALTER

Was this some time you had a bad dream or?



B1

shouting on and on



SALTER

I don’t think I



B1

shouting and shouting



SALTER

no



B1

and you never came, nobody ever came



SALTER

so was this after your mum



B1

after my mum was dead this was after



SALTER

because you were very little when she



B1

yes because I can only remember



SALTER

you were maybe two when she



B1

and I remember her sitting there, she was there



SALTER

you remember so early?



B1

she’d be there but she wouldn’t help stop anything



SALTER

I’m surprised



B1

so when I was shouting what I want to know



SALTER

but when was this



B1

I want to know if you could hear me or not because I never knew were you hearing me and not coming or could you not hear me and if I shouted loud enough you’d come



SALTER

I can’t have heard you, no



B1

or maybe there was no one there at all and you’d gone out so no matter how hard I shouted there was no one there



SALTER

no that wouldn’t have



B1

so then I’d stop shouting but it was worse



SALTER

because I hardly ever



B1

and I didn’t dare get out of bed to go and see



SALTER

I don’t think this can have



B1

because if there was nobody there that would be terrifying and if you were there that might be worse but it’s something I wonder



SALTER

no



B1

could you hear me shouting?



SALTER

no I don’t



B1

no



SALTER

no I don’t think this happened in quite the



B1

what?



SALTER

because I’d



B1

again and again and again, every night I’d be



SALTER

no



B1

so you didn’t hear?



SALTER

no but you can’t have



B1

yes I was shouting, are you telling me you didn’t



SALTER

no of course I didn’t



B1

you didn’t



SALTER

no



B1

you weren’t sitting there listening to me shouting



SALTER

no



B1

you weren’t out



SALTER

no



B1

so I needed to shout louder.



SALTER

Of course sometimes everyone who’s had children will tell you sometimes you put them to bed and they want another story and you say goodnight now and go away and they call out once or twice and you say no go to sleep now and they might call out again and they go to sleep.



B1

The other one. Your son. My brother is he? my little twin.



SALTER

Yes.



B1

Has he got a child?



SALTER

No.



B1

Because if he had I’d kill it.



SALTER

No, he hasn’t got one.



B1

So when you opened the door you didn’t recognise me.



SALTER

No because



B1

Do you recognise me now?



SALTER

I know it’s you.



B1

No but look at me.



SALTER

I have. I am.



B1

No, look in my eyes. No, keep looking. Look.





3.

SALTER and BERNARD (B2).

B2

Not like me at all



SALTER

not like



B2

well like like but not identical not



SALTER

not identical no not



B2

because what struck me was how different



SALTER

yes I was struck



B2

you couldn’t mistake



SALTER

no no not at all I knew at once it wasn’t



B2

though of course he is older if I was older



SALTER

but even then you wouldn’t



B2

I wouldn’t be identical



SALTER

no no not at all no, you’re a different



B2

just a bit like



SALTER

well bound to be a bit



B2

because for a start I’m not frightening.



SALTER

So what did he want did he



B2

no nothing really, not frightening not



SALTER

he didn’t hit you?



B2

hit? god no, hit me? do you think?



SALTER

well he



B2

he could have done yes, no he shouted



SALTER

shouted



B1

shouted and rambled really, rambled he’s not entirely



SALTER

no, well



B2

so that’s what, his childhood, his life, his childhood



SALTER

all kinds of



B2

has made him a nutter really is what I think I mean not a nutter but he’s



SALTER

yes yes I’m not, yes he probably is.



B2

He says all kinds of wild



SALTER

yes



B2

so you don’t know what to believe.



SALTER

And how did it end up, are you on friendly



B2

friendly no



SALTER

not



B2

no no we ended up



SALTER

yes



B2

we ended as I mean to go on with me running away, I was glad we were meeting in a public place, if I’d been at home you can’t run away in your own home and if we’d been at his I wonder if he’d have let me go he might put me in a cupboard not really, anyway yes I got up and left and I kept thinking had he followed me.



SALTER

As you mean to go on as in not seeing him any more



B2

as in leaving the country.



SALTER

For what for a week or two a holiday, I don’t



B2

leaving, going on yes I don’t know, going away, I don’t want to be here.



SALTER

But when you come back he’ll still



B2

so maybe I won’t



SALTER

but that’s, not come back, no that’s



B2

I don’t know I don’t know don’t ask me I don’t know. I’m going, I don’t know. I don’t want to be anywhere near him.



SALTER

You think he might try to hurt you?



B2

Why? why do you keep



SALTER

I don’t know. Is it that?



B2

It’s partly that, it’s also it’s horrible, I don’t feel myself and there’s the others too, I don’t want to see them I don’t want them



SALTER

I thought you did.



B2

I thought I did, I might, if I go away by myself I might feel all right, I might feel – you can understand that.



SALTER

Yes, yes I can.



B2

Because there’s this person who’s identical to me



SALTER

he’s not



B2

who’s not identical, who’s like



SALTER

not even very



B2

not very like but very something terrible which is exactly the same genetic person



SALTER

not the same person



B2

and I don’t like it.



SALTER

I know. I’m sorry.



B2

I know you’re sorry I’m not



SALTER

I know



B2

I’m not trying to make you say sorry



SALTER

I know, I just am



B2

I know



SALTER

I just am sorry.



B2

He said some things.



SALTER

Yes.



B2

There’s a lot of things I don’t, could you tell me what happened to my mother?



SALTER

She’s dead.



B2

Yes.



SALTER

I told you she was dead.



B2

Yes but she didn’t die when I was born and she didn’t die with the first child in a carcrash because the first child’s not dead he’s walking round the streets at night giving me nightmares. Unless she did die in a carcrash?



SALTER

No.



B2

No.



SALTER

Your mother, the thing a thing about your mother was that she wasn’t very happy, she wasn’t a very happy person at all, I don’t mean there were sometimes days she wasn’t happy or I did things that made her not happy I did of course, she was always not happy, often cheerful and



B2

she killed herself. How did she do that?



SALTER

She did it under a train under a tube train, she was one of those people when they say there has been a person under a train and the trains are delayed she was a person under a train.



B2

Were you with her?



SALTER

With her on the platform no, I was still with her more or less but not with her then no I was having a drink I think.



B2

And the boy?



SALTER

Do you know I don’t remember where the boy was. I think he was at a friend’s house, we had friends.



B2

And he was how old four?



SALTER

no no he was four later when I he was walking, about two just starting to talk



B2

he was four when you sent him



SALTER

that’s right when his mother died he was two.



B2

So this was let me be clear this was before this was some years before I was born she died before



SALTER

yes



B2

so she was already always



SALTER

yes she was



B2

just so I’m clear. And then you and the boy you and your son



SALTER

we went on we just



B2

lived alone together



SALTER

yes



B2

you were bringing him up



SALTER

yes



B2

the best you could



SALTER

I



B2

until



SALTER

and my best wasn’t very but I had my moments, don’t think, I did cook meals now and then and read a story I’m sure I can remember a particularly boring and badly written little book about an elephant at sea. But I could have managed better.



B2

Yes he said something about it



SALTER

he said



B2

yes



SALTER

yes of course he did yes. I know I could have managed better because I did with you because I stopped, shut myself away, gave it all up came off it all while I waited for you and I think we may even have had that same book, maybe it’s you I remember reading it to, do you remember it at all? it had an elephant in red trousers.



B2

No I don’t think



SALTER

no it was terrible, we had far better books we had



B2

Maybe he shouldn’t blame you, maybe it was a genetic, could you help drinking we don’t know or drugs at the time philosophically as I understand it it wasn’t viewed as not like now when our understanding’s different and would a different person genetically different person not have been so been so vulnerable because there could always be some genetic addictive and then again someone with the same genetic exactly the same but at a different time a different cultural and of course all the personal all kinds of what happened in your own life your childhood or things all kind of because suppose you’d had a brother with identical an identical twin say but separated at birth so you had entirely different early you see what I’m saying would he have done the same things who can say he might have been a very loving father and in fact of course you have that in you to be that because you were to me so it’s a combination of very complicated and that’s who you were so probably I shouldn’t blame you.



SALTER

I’d rather you blamed me. I blame myself.



B2

I’m not saying you weren’t horrible.



SALTER

Couldn’t I not have been?



B2

Apparently not.



SALTER

If I’d tried harder.



B2

But someone like you couldn’t have tried harder. What does it mean? If you’d tried harder you’d have been different from what you were like and you weren’t you were



SALTER

but then later I



B2

later yes



SALTER

I did try that’s what I did I started again I



B2

that’s what



SALTER

I was good I tried to be good I was good to you



B2

that’s what you were like



SALTER

I was good



B2

but I can’t you can’t I can’t give you credit for that if I don’t give you blame for the other it’s what you did it’s what happened



SALTER

but it felt



B2

it felt



SALTER

it felt as if I tried I deliberately



B2

of course it felt



SALTER

well then



B2

it feels it always it feels doesn’t it inside that’s just how we feel what we are and we don’t know all these complicated we can’t know what we’re it’s too complicated to disentangle all the causes and we feel this is me I freely and of course it’s true who you are does freely not forced by someone else but who you are who you are itself forces or you’d be someone else wouldn’t you?



SALTER

I did some bad things. I deserve to suffer. I did some better things. I’d like recognition.



B2

That’s how everyone feels, certainly.



SALTER

He still blames me.



B2

There’s a difference then.



SALTER

You remind me of him.



B2

I remind myself of him. We both hate you.



SALTER

I thought you



B2

I don’t blame you it’s not your fault but what you’ve been like what you’re like I can’t help it.



SALTER

Yes of course.



B2

Except what he feels as hate and what I feel as hate are completely different because what you did to him and what you did to me are different things.



SALTER

I was nice to you.



B2

Yes you were.



SALTER

You don’t have to go away. Not for long.



B2

It might make me feel better.



SALTER

I love you.



B2

That’s something else you can’t help.



SALTER

That’s all right. That’s all right.



B2

Also I’m afraid he’ll kill me.

So what kind of a place was it? was it



B1

the place



SALTER

he was in a hotel was he or



B1

no



SALTER

I thought he was in a hotel. So where was he?



B1

what?



SALTER

I’m trying to get a picture.



B1

Does it matter?



SALTER

It won’t bring him back no obviously but I’d like I’d like you can’t help feeling curious you want to get at it and you’re blocked in all directions, your son dies you want his body, you want to know where his body last was when he was alive, you can’t help



B1

He had a room.



SALTER

In somebody’s house, renting



B1

some small you know how the locals when you arrive, just a room not breakfast you’d go out for a coffee.



SALTER

So was it some pretty on a harbour front or



B1

no



SALTER

thinking of him on holiday



B1

in a street just a side



SALTER

but of course it wasn’t a holiday he was hiding he thought he was hiding. Did you go inside the room?



B1

Just a small room, rather dark, one window and the shutters



SALTER

not very tidy I expect



B1

that’s right, not tidy the bed not made, couple of books, bag on the floor with clothes half out of it



SALTER

did he scream?



B1

and you know what he’s like, not tidy, am I tidy you don’t know do you but you’d guess not wouldn’t you but you’d be wrong there because I’m meticulous.



SALTER

What I want to know is how you actually, what you, how you got him to go off to some remote because that’s what I’m imagining, you don’t shoot the lodger without the landlady hearing, I don’t know if you did shoot I don’t know why I say shoot you could have had a knife you could have strangled, I can’t think he would have gone off with you because he was frightened which is why but perhaps you talked you made him feel or did you follow him or lie in wait in some dark? and I don’t know how you found him there did you follow him from his house when he left or follow him from here last time he?



B1

I didn’t need to tell you it had happened



SALTER

but you did so naturally I want to



B1

and I’m wishing I hadn’t



SALTER

no I’m glad



B1

and I’m not telling you



SALTER

because I won’t tell anyone



B1

and there’s nothing more to be said.



SALTER

What about the others? or is he the only one you hated because I loved him, I don’t love the others, you and I have got common cause against the others don’t forget, I’m still hoping we’ll make our fortunes there. I’m going to talk to a solicitor, I’ve been too busy not busy but it’s been like a storm going on I don’t know what’s gone on, it’s not been very long ago it all started. You’re not going to be a serial, wipe them all out so you’re the only, back like it was at the start I’d understand that. If they do catch up with you, I’m sure they won’t I’m sure you know what you’re, if they do we’ll tell them it was me it was my fault anyway you look at it. Don’t you agree, don’t you feel that? Don’t stop talking to me. It wasn’t his fault, you should have killed me, it’s my fault you. Perhaps you’re going to kill me, is that why you’ve stopped talking? Shall I kill myself ? I’d do that for you if you like, would you like that?





I’ll tell you a thought, I could have killed you and I didn’t. I may have done terrible things but I didn’t kill you. I could have killed you and had another son, made one the same like I did or start again have a different one get married again and I didn’t, I spared you though you were this disgusting thing by then anyone in their right mind would have squashed you but I remembered what you’d been like at the beginning and I spared you, I didn’t want a different one, I wanted that again because you were perfect just like that and I loved you.





You know you asked me when you used to shout in the night. Sometimes I was there, I’d sit and listen to you or I’d not be in any condition to hear you I’d just be sitting. Sometimes I’d go out and leave you. I don’t think you got out of bed, did you get out of bed, because you’d be frightened what I’d do to you so it was all right to go out. That was just a short period you used to shout, you grew out of that, you got so you’d rather not see me, you wanted to be left alone in the night, you wouldn’t want me to come any more. You’d nearly stopped speaking do you remember that? not speaking not eating I tried to make you. I’d put you in the cupboard do you remember? or I’d look for you everywhere and I’d think you’d got away and I’d find you under the bed. You liked it there I’d put your dinner under for you. But it got worse do you remember? There was nobody but us. One day I cleaned you up and said take him into care. You didn’t look too bad and they took you away. My darling. Do you remember that? Do you remember that day because I don’t remember it you know. The whole thing is very vague to me. It’s two years I remember almost nothing about but you must remember things and when you’re that age two years is much longer, it wasn’t very long to me, it was one long night out. Can you tell me anything you remember? the day you left? can you tell me things I did I might have forgotten?



B1

When I was following him there was a time I was getting on the same train and he looked round, I thought he was looking right at me but he didn’t see me. I got on the train and went with him all the way.



SALTER

Yes? yes?





5.

SALTER and MICHAEL BLACK, his son, thirty-five.

MICHAEL

Have you met the others?



SALTER

You’re the first.



MICHAEL

Are you going to meet us all?



SALTER

I thought I’d start.



MICHAEL

I’m sure everyone will be pleased to meet you. I know I am.



SALTER

I’m sorry to stare.



MICHAEL

No, please, I can see it must be. Do I look like?



SALTER

Yes of course



MICHAEL

of course, I meant



SALTER

no no I didn’t mean



MICHAEL

I suppose I meant how



SALTER

because of course you don’t, you don’t, not exactly



MICHAEL

no of course



SALTER

I wouldn’t mistake



MICHAEL

no



SALTER

or I might at a casual



MICHAEL

of course



SALTER

but not if I really look



MICHAEL

no



SALTER

no



MICHAEL

because?



SALTER

because of the eyes. You don’t look at me in the same way.



MICHAEL

I’m looking at someone I don’t know of course.



SALTER

Maybe you could tell me a little



MICHAEL

about myself



SALTER

if you don’t mind



MICHAEL

no of course, it’s where to, you already know I’m a teacher, mathematics, you know I’m married, three children did I tell you that



SALTER

yes but you didn’t



MICHAEL

boy and girl twelve and eight and now a baby well eighteen months so she’s walking and beginning to talk, I don’t have any photographs on me I didn’t think, there’s no need for photographs is there if you see someone all the time so



SALTER

are you happy?



MICHAEL

what now? or in general? Yes I think I am, I don’t think about it, I am. The job gets me down sometimes. The world’s a mess of course. But you can’t help, a sunny morning, leaves turning, off to the park with the baby, you can’t help feeling wonderful can you?



SALTER

Can’t you?



MICHAEL

Well that’s how I seem to be.



SALTER

Tell me. Forgive me



MICHAEL

no go on



SALTER

tell me something about yourself that’s really specific to you, something really important



MICHAEL

what sort of?



SALTER

anything



MICHAEL

it’s hard to



SALTER

yes.



MICHAEL

Well here’s something I find fascinating, there are these people who used to live in holes in the ground, with all tunnels and underground chambers and sometimes you’d have a chamber you’d get to it through a labyrinth of passages and the ceiling got lower and lower so you had to go on your hands and knees and then wriggle on your stomach and you’d get through to this chamber deep deep down that had a hole like a chimney like a well a hole all the way up to the sky so you could sit in this chamber this room this cave whatever and look up at a little circle of sky going past overhead. And when somebody died they’d hollow out more little rooms so they weren’t buried underneath you they were buried in the walls beside you. And maybe sometimes they walled people up alive in there, it’s possible because of how the remains were contorted but either way of course they’re dead by now and very soon after they went in of course. And



SALTER

I don’t think this is what I’m looking for



MICHAEL

oh, how, sorry



SALTER

because what you’re telling me is about something else and I was hoping for something about you



MICHAEL

I don’t quite



SALTER

I’m sorry I don’t know I was hoping



MICHAEL

you want what my beliefs, politics how I feel about war for instance is that? I dislike war, I’m not at all happy when people say we’re doing a lot of good with our bombing, I’m never very comfortable with that. War’s one of those things, don’t you think, where everyone always thinks they’re in the right have you noticed that? Nobody ever says we’re the bad guys, we’re going to beat shit out of the good guys. What do you think?



SALTER

I was hoping I don’t know something more personal something from deep inside your life. If that’s not intrusive.



MICHAEL

Maybe what maybe my wife’s ears?



SALTER

Yes?



MICHAEL

Because last night we were watching the news and I thought what beautiful and slightly odd ears she’s got, they’re small but with big lobes, big relative to the small ear, and they’re slightly pointy on top, like a disney elf or little animal ears and they’re always there but you know how you suddenly notice and noticing that, I mean the way I love her, felt very felt what you said something deep inside. Or the children obviously, I could talk about, is this the sort of thing?



SALTER

it’s not quite



MICHAEL

no



SALTER

because you’re just describing other people or



MICHAEL

yes



SALTER

not yourself



MICHAEL

but it’s people I love so



SALTER

it’s not what I’m looking for. Because anyone could feel



MICHAEL

oh of course I’m not claiming



SALTER

I was somehow hoping



MICHAEL

yes



SALTER

further in



MICHAEL

yes



SALTER

just about yourself



MICHAEL

myself



SALTER

yes



MICHAEL

like maybe I’m lying in bed and it’s comfortable and then it gets slightly not so comfortable and I move my legs or even turn over and then it’s



SALTER

no



MICHAEL

no



SALTER

no that’s



MICHAEL

yes that’s something everyone



SALTER

yes



MICHAEL

well I don’t know. I like blue socks. Banana icecream. Does that help you?



SALTER

Dogs?



MICHAEL

do I like



SALTER

dogs



MICHAEL

I’m ok with dogs. My daughter wants a puppy but I don’t know. Is dogs the kind of thing?



SALTER

So tell me what did you feel when you found out?



MICHAEL

Fascinated.



SALTER

Not angry?



MICHAEL

No.



SALTER

Not frightened.



MICHAEL

No, what of ?



SALTER

Your life, losing your life.



MICHAEL

I’ve still got my life.



SALTER

But there are things there are things that are what you are, I think you’re avoiding



MICHAEL

yes perhaps



SALTER

because then you might be frightened



MICHAEL

I don’t think



SALTER

or angry



MICHAEL

not really



SALTER

because what does it do what does it to you to everything if there are all these walking around, what it does to me what am I and it’s not even me it happened to, so how you can just, you must think something about it.



MICHAEL

I think it’s funny, I think it’s delightful



SALTER

delightful?



MICHAEL

all these very similar people doing things like each other or a bit different or whatever we’re doing, what a thrill for the mad old professor if he’d lived to see it, I do see the joy of it. I know you’re not at all happy.



SALTER

I didn’t feel I’d lost him when I sent him away because I had the second chance. And when the second one my son the second son was murdered it wasn’t so bad as you’d think because it seemed fair. I was back with the first one.



MICHAEL

But now



SALTER

now he’s killed himself



MICHAEL

now you feel



SALTER

now I’ve lost him, I’ve lost



MICHAEL

yes



SALTER

now I can’t put it right any more. Because the second time round you see I slept very lightly with the door open.



MICHAEL

Is that the worst you did, not go in the night?



SALTER

No of course not.



MICHAEL

Like what?



SALTER

Things that are what I did that are not trivial like banana icecream nor unifuckingversal like turning over in bed.



MICHAEL

We’ve got ninety-nine per cent the same genes as any other person. We’ve got ninety per cent the same as a chimpanzee. We’ve got thirty percent the same as a lettuce. Does that cheer you up at all? I love about the lettuce. It makes me feel I belong.



SALTER

I miss him so much. I miss them both.



MICHAEL

There’s nineteen more of us.



SALTER

That’s not the same.



MICHAEL

No of course not. I was making a joke.



SALTER

And you’re happy you say are you? you like your life?



MICHAEL

I do yes, sorry.





A DREAM PLAY

After Strindberg





Introduction

Is it a larder? Is it a fridge? Is it more fun, more vivid, or even more true to what Strindberg meant, to update the larder door which is just like the ones the Officer saw when he was a child? A larder’s where the food is, so does a fridge give us more directly, without archaism, the promise of satisfaction of appetite? And make it easier to see why the characters hope that if they finally get the door open they’ll find the meaning of life inside? Or is it a silly idea and a modernism too far?

You don’t of course consciously think all that, you think ‘fridge’ and smile. I did this version for Katie Mitchell, who was already planning to direct it at the National Theatre, and she had said she welcomed anachronisms. So when the happy couple decide to kill themselves because bliss doesn’t last (‘Life is wretched. I pity mankind.’), I could write, ‘People are so fucked up.’

There’s a strand of the play that is about academia, and that’s where I’ve done the most updating. The university and its bossy deans of theology, philosophy, medicine and law don’t have the power over us that they seemed to have over Strindberg. Here a bishop, psychoanalyst, scientist and barrister are on the committee of the inquiry looking into the opening of the door, and the solicitor is refused not a doctorate but a knighthood. Not a big change, and on the whole this version stays close to the original.

What I’ve mostly done is tighten the dialogue and cut out a few chunks. Strindberg lived in a far more Christian society than ours, and his swipes at it look a bit unnecessary now, so I’ve taken some of them out. Though, with a Christian prime minister and an American president voted in by right-wing Christians both calling us to fight evil, perhaps we should feel as dominated by religion as Strindberg did. Still, we don’t, so I’m not restoring those cuts. I’ve cut references to the Flying Dutchman and the Caliph Haroun; I’ve cut things that seemed repetitive; sometimes I’ve cut bits that just seemed to me or Katie not to work very well. And I’ve cut the meaning of life.

When it turns out there’s nothing behind the fridge door, the daughter of the gods promises the writer she’ll tell him the secret when they’re alone. What she says may have seemed more original or daring when Strindberg wrote it, but seems a bit of an anticlimax to us. So in this version she whispers it to the writer and we never know what it is. But was telling us the meaning of life one of the main points of the play for Strindberg? I hope not. I do feel abashed at cutting another writer’s work; directors have fewer qualms.

I said the version was close to the original but of course I’ve no idea what the original is as I don’t know any Swedish. The very few translations I’ve done before have been from French or Latin, where I knew enough to see what the text was literally saying. I’d never wanted to work from a literal translation of a language I didn’t know. To my surprise, the one I was given wasn’t literally literal, the kind of thing I’d done for myself at first when translating Latin, with odd word order and odd words, but a translation, by Charlotte Barslund, which seemed to me as performable as the existing translations I’d looked at. So that for me is the original I’ve kept close to.

People who are looking at this text after seeing Katie Mitchell’s production may or may not find considerable differences. Working as she has before, she and the actors may add other material or change the order of scenes, or they may end up very close to this text. I’ve put in Strindberg’s stage directions, which are what Katie and designer Vicki Mortimer are starting from, rather than describing their solutions, since other productions may want to use this text and come up with their own versions of stage doors, caves and quarantine stations. When Strindberg was writing the play a castle was being built in Stockholm and grew over the trees, and the town was full of soldiers. The equivalent fast-growing buildings for us are office towers; a soldier means our current wars to us, not the romantic officer of the play; our city towers are full of businessmen. So we’ve gone for a tower, which works well both ways – prisoners are kept in towers – and for a while we went with a Banker instead of an Officer. Katie’s staying with the Banker but I’ve gone back to the Officer for this text, feeling as with the stage directions that I shouldn’t put too much of the production into it. I’ve kept the fridge though – if you’re not happy with anachronism feel free to go back to the larder.

I’d read the play several times over the years, admired the way it moved, but never, I realise, taken in the detail. I was surprised by its tenderness. Since starting this version I’ve learned more about Strindberg than I knew before. I suppose I’d thought of him as misogynistic and depressive and mostly concerned with miserable relationships and disastrous families. All of which of course you can find in A Dream Play. I hadn’t realised how political he was, that he was a hero to trade unionists, who made a detour in a parade to pass his window. When asked what mattered to him most he said, ‘Disarmament.’ He added the coal-miner scene (building workers here) after the play was finished, because there was a miners’ strike in Stockholm.

I’m not sure how I’d feel if someone treated one of my plays the way I’ve treated Strindberg’s, even though I hope I’ve made it clearer and not spoilt it. I wouldn’t like it now, but perhaps when a play is over a hundred years old you should just be glad it’s still being done. And it survives unharmed in Swedish. I’d like to think he’d be glad about this version. I’d like to make him smile. But maybe he’d say, ‘Oh woe. Life is wretched.’

Caryl Churchill





Author’s Note

As with his earlier dream play, To Damascus, the author has in this dream play sought to imitate the disjointed yet seemingly logical shape of a dream. Everything can happen, everything is possible and probable. Time and place do not exist; the imagination spins, weaving new patterns on a flimsy basis of reality: a mixture of memories, experiences, free associations, absurdities and improvisations.

The characters split, double, multiply, evaporate, condense, dissolve and merge. But one consciousness rules them all: the dreamer’s; for him there are no secrets, no inconsistencies, no scruples and no laws. He does not judge or acquit, he merely relates; and, because a dream is usually painful rather than pleasant, a tone of melancholy and compassion for all living creatures permeates the rambling narrative. Sleep, the liberator, often feels like torture, but when the torment is at its worst, the moment of awakening comes and reconciles the sufferer with reality, which, regardless of how painful it might be, is at this very moment a joy compared to the agonies of dreaming.

August Strindberg

1. Outside the Tower

Huge hollyhocks.

A tower with a flower bud on top.

AGNES and GLAZIER.

AGNES

Look how the tower’s grown.



GLAZIER

What tower?



AGNES

It’s twice the size it was last year.



GLAZIER

Yes of course, it must be the fertiliser.



AGNES

But shouldn’t it be flowering by now?



GLAZIER

Can’t you see the flower?



AGNES

Yes, yes, I see it. Do you know who lives in the tower?



GLAZIER

I do but I can’t remember.



AGNES

I think it’s a prisoner. And I think he’s waiting for me to set him free. Let’s go in.





2. Room inside the Tower

AGNES, GLAZIER, OFFICER.

OFFICER is rocking his chair and hitting the table with his sword.

AGNES

(Takes the sword.) Don’t. Don’t.



OFFICER

Please, Agnes, let me keep my sword.



AGNES

You’re hacking the table. (To GLAZIER.) Go down to the tackroom and mend the window and I’ll see you later.





GLAZIER goes.





You’re a prisoner and I’ve come to set you free.



OFFICER

It’s what I’ve been waiting for. But I wasn’t sure you wanted to.



AGNES

Do you want to?



OFFICER

I don’t know. I’ll be miserable either way. It’s terrible sitting here but it’s going to be so painful being free. Agnes, I’d rather stay here if I can go on seeing you.



AGNES

What do you see?



OFFICER

I look at you and it’s something to do with the stars and the smallest particles, you’re somehow connected.



AGNES

But so are you.



OFFICER

Then why do I have to muck out the horses?



AGNES

To make you long to get away.



OFFICER

I do but it’s such an effort.



AGNES

It’s your duty to seek freedom in the light.



OFFICER

To be free is a duty?



AGNES

Your duty to life.



OFFICER

Life doesn’t do its duty to me so why should I?





AGNES, OFFICER, FATHER, MOTHER.





MOTHER is working on shirts at a table.





FATHER gives MOTHER a silk dress.



FATHER

You don’t want it?



MOTHER

What’s the point when I’m dying?



FATHER

You believe the doctor?



MOTHER

I believe how I feel.



FATHER

Then it is serious? And all you think about is how it affects the children.



MOTHER

They’re all that matters.



FATHER

Kristina, forgive me. For everything.



MOTHER

Oh yes? All right, forgive me too. We’ve both hurt each other. We don’t know why. We couldn’t help it. Look, here are the boys’ new shirts. They have clean ones on Wednesdays and Sundays. And make sure Lina washes them all over. Are you going out?



FATHER

I have to be at college. It’s nearly eleven.



MOTHER

Get Alfred for me first.



FATHER

But he’s here already.



MOTHER

My eyes must be going. Or it’s getting dark.





She turns on the light.





Alfred.





FATHER goes.





Who’s that girl?



OFFICER

Agnes.



MOTHER

Oh is that Agnes? You know what they’re saying? She’s the daughter of the gods and she’s come down to earth to find out what it’s like to be a human being. But don’t say anything.





Alfred, before I die. Always remember this.



OFFICER

Yes.



MOTHER

Don’t go on feeling life’s been unfair to you.



OFFICER

But it has.



MOTHER

You were punished for stealing a coin that had just slipped down the back of the sofa.



OFFICER

Yes and it ruined my life.



MOTHER

Now go to the cupboard.



OFFICER

You know about that?



MOTHER

Treasure Island.



OFFICER

Don’t.



MOTHER

Which your brother was punished for when it was you who tore it to pieces and hid it in the cupboard.



OFFICER

How can that cupboard be there after twenty years? We’ve moved house. And you died ten years ago.



MOTHER

So? You’re always asking questions and ruining everything. Look, here’s Lina.





LINA enters.



LINA

Thank you for giving me time off, ma’am, but I can’t go anyway because I’ve nothing to wear.



MOTHER

Here, borrow this.



LINA

Oh ma’am, I couldn’t.



MOTHER

Don’t be silly. I won’t be going out any more.



OFFICER

What will dad say? It was a present.



MOTHER

Alfred, that’s so petty.





FATHER pops his head round.



FATHER

Are you lending my present to the maid?



MOTHER

Don’t say maid like that, I was a maid once or have you forgotten? Why do you have to be so horrible to the poor girl?



FATHER

Why do you have to be so horrible to your husband?



MOTHER

Whenever you try to help someone you hurt someone else. I’m sick of life.





MOTHER turns off the light.





AGNES, OFFICER.



AGNES

I’m sorry for them.



OFFICER

Really?



AGNES

Yes, people find things so difficult. But there’s always love. Look.





3. Outside the Stage Door

Enormous foxglove.

Green tree.

Fridge door.

Billboard.

AGNES, OFFICER, STAGE DOOR KEEPER, BILLSTICKER.

STAGE DOOR KEEPER is sewing.

AGNES

Is that the same star blanket you’re still making?



SD KEEPER

Twenty-six years isn’t long.



AGNES

And he never came back?



SD KEEPER

It wasn’t his fault.



AGNES

(To BILLSTICKER.) Didn’t she used to be a ballet dancer?



BILLSTICK

Yes, she was a prima ballerina. But when he left, her dancing went with him and she stopped getting the parts.



AGNES

Everyone’s complaining. If it’s not what they say, it’s how they look.



BILLSTICK

I don’t, not now I’ve got my fishing net and my bucket. That’s what I wanted when I was four and now I’m fifty-four and I’ve got them.



AGNES

Fifty years for that.



BILLSTICK

It’s a green bucket.



AGNES

(To SD KEEPER.) Lend me your coat and I’ll sit here and watch.





She puts on the coat and sits down.



SD KEEPER

It’s nearly the end of the season and today they hear if they’re going to be kept on.



AGNES

And what if they’re not?



SD KEEPER

I hide my face.





SINGER crosses in tears.





Look, she’s been dropped.



AGNES

Poor things.



BILLSTICK

No, this one’s happy. He’s going to marry Victoria.





OFFICER enters with bunch of roses.



OFFICER

Victoria!



BILLSTICK

She’ll be right down.



OFFICER

The taxi’s here, I’ve booked a table, the champagne’s on ice. I have to give you a hug.





He hugs STAGE DOOR KEEPER and AGNES.





Victoria!



VICTORIA

(Off.) Coming!



AGNES

Don’t you know me?



OFFICER

Sorry, I only know Victoria. I’ve been walking up and down for seven years. You can see how my feet have worn a path. Ah she’s mine. Victoria! (He waits.) She’s getting dressed. I see you’ve got a fishing net. Everyone at the opera loves fish even though they can’t sing. How much does a thing like that cost?



BILLSTICK

You have to save up.



OFFICER

Victoria! (Of tree.) Look, it’s turning green again. Eighth time.





Victoria! She’s combing her fringe. Excuse me, I have to go up and fetch my bride.



SD KEEPER

No one’s allowed in the dressing rooms.



OFFICER

Seven times three hundred and sixty-five is . . . two thousand five hundred and fifty-five days. And I’ve looked at this door two thousand five hundred and fifty-five times without knowing where it goes. What is it? Does anyone live there?



SD KEEPER

I don’t know. I’ve never seen it opened.



OFFICER

It looks like a fridge door I saw when I was four and the maid took me out one Sunday afternoon. Different families, different maids, but I never got further than the kitchen and I liked sitting under the table. I’ve seen so many kitchens and the fridge doors were always the same. But the opera can’t have a fridge because it hasn’t got a kitchen. Victoria! Listen, I don’t suppose she could come out a different way?



SD KEEPER

No, this is the only way out.



OFFICER

Good, then I can’t miss her.





THEATRE PEOPLE come out.





She’ll be here soon. I saw that identical foxglove when I was seven in a vicarage garden. There were two blue pigeons. Then a bee flew into one of the bells and I thought ‘got you’ and grabbed the flower and the bee stung me right through it and I cried. But then the vicar’s wife put wet earth on it and we had wild strawberries and milk for supper. It seems to be getting dark. (To BILLSTICKER.) Where are you going?



BILLSTICK

Home to supper.



OFFICER

Evening? Now? Listen, can I use the phone? I have to phone the tower.



AGNES

What for?



OFFICER

I want to tell the glazier to put in double-glazing. It’s nearly winter and I feel the cold.





OFFICER goes.



AGNES

Who is Victoria?



BILLSTICK

The one he loves.



AGNES

Yes, that’s all he knows about her. He doesn’t care about what she means to other people. Just what she is to him, that’s all she is.





BILLSTICKER goes.





Suddenly it’s dark.



SD KEEPER

Getting dark quickly today.



AGNES

A year can feel like a minute.



SD KEEPER

No, a minute can feel like a year.





OFFICER comes back, dusty, roses withered.



OFFICER

She hasn’t come down yet.



SD KEEPER

No.



OFFICER

She will come. She will come. But maybe I’ll cancel lunch. Yes, that’s what I’ll do.





He goes.



SD KEEPER

Can I have my coat now?



AGNES

No, you have a break and I’ll stay here. I want to find out more about life.



SD KEEPER

You don’t get any sleep in this job.



AGNES

Not at night?



SD KEEPER

You can have a doze if you don’t mind being woken up, because the security guards change every three hours.



AGNES

What a horrible job.



SD KEEPER

Plenty of people want it.



AGNES

Want to be woken up?



SD KEEPER

That’s not the worse thing, or the cold and the damp. It’s hearing all their troubles. There’s thirty years of trouble in that coat.



AGNES

It’s heavy and scratchy.



SD KEEPER

Call me when it gets too much.



AGNES

Goodbye. If you can bear it, I can.



SD KEEPER

Be kind to them.





STAGE DOOR KEEPER goes.





The leaves have fallen from the tree, the foxglove has wilted. OFFICER enters, his hair and beard are grey, his clothes worn and dirty. The roses are just stems.



OFFICER

It seems to be autumn. I can tell by the tree. But autumn’s spring for me because that’s when the theatre opens for the new season. And then she’ll come. Do you mind if I sit down for a moment?



AGNES

Please do. I can stand.



OFFICER

If only I could get some sleep it wouldn’t be so bad.





I can’t stop wondering about this door. What’s behind it?





Faint music.





They’ve started rehearsals.





Alternate light and dark.





What’s going on? Light dark, light dark.



AGNES

Day night, day night. So you don’t have to wait so long.





BILLSTICKER returns.



OFFICER

Catch anything?



BILLSTICK

Yes, plenty. But the summer was a bit hot and rather long. It’s a very good net but not quite what I imagined.



OFFICER

No, this isn’t quite what I imagined.



BILLSTICK

She hasn’t come?



OFFICER

Not yet, she’ll be down in a minute. You don’t happen to know what’s behind this door?



BILLSTICK

No, I’ve never seen it open.



OFFICER

I’m going to phone a locksmith.





OFFICER goes.



AGNES

What was wrong with the net?



BILLSTICK

No, it’s fine. But it wasn’t quite what I imagined. I did enjoy it but . . .



AGNES

How did you imagine it?



BILLSTICK

It’s hard to say.



AGNES

Maybe green but not exactly that green?



BILLSTICK

That’s why everyone likes talking to you. Could you spare a few minutes?



AGNES

Come in here and tell me.





Tree green again and foxglove in bloom.





OFFICER enters, old with white hair, worn shoes, carrying stems.





BALLET DANCER enters.



OFFICER

Has Victoria left?



DANCER

No, not yet.



OFFICER

Then I’ll wait. I expect she’ll be down soon.



DANCER

I expect so.



OFFICER

Don’t go, I’ve sent for the locksmith, you’ll see what’s behind this door.



DANCER

That’s interesting. That and the tower that keeps growing. Do you know the tower?



OFFICER

I was a prisoner there.



DANCER

Really? were you?





SINGER enters.



OFFICER

Has Victoria left?



SINGER

No, she never leaves.



OFFICER

That’s because she loves me. Please don’t go. There’s a locksmith coming to open the door.



SINGER

Opening the door? what fun. There’s just something I want to ask the stage-door keeper.





PROMPTER enters.



OFFICER

Has Victoria left?



PROMPTER

Not as far as I know.



OFFICER

There, didn’t I tell you she was waiting for me? Don’t go, we’re about to open the door.



PROMPTER

Which door?



OFFICER

Is there more than one door?



PROMPTER

Oh this one. Yes, I’ll stay to see that. Just need to have a word with the stage-door keeper.





GLAZIER enters.



OFFICER

Is that the locksmith?



GLAZIER

No, he had friends round, but a glazier’s just as good.



OFFICER

Yes, of course. Did you bring your diamond? Let’s do it.





More SINGERS and DANCERS enter in opera costumes.





Thank you all for coming. This is a once in a lifetime moment, so I ask you to –





Armed POLICEMEN enter, shouting.



POLICE

Keep away from the door.



OFFICER

Oh god, whenever you try to do something new. But we’ll see them in court. A solicitor!





4. Room (Solicitor’s Office)

AGNES, OFFICER, SOLICITOR.

SOLICITOR

Let me take your coat. I’ll put it in the bin.



AGNES

Not yet. I know it’s disgusting because it’s full of people’s problems but I want to get even more. I’d like to soak up all the crimes you know about and the false imprisonments and abuse.



SOLICITOR

Your coat’s not big enough. The pain’s spattered all over the room, it’s stained the wallpaper. It’s all over me, my hands are black, look they’re cracked and bleeding. I can only wear my clothes a couple of days and then they stink. I use air freshener but it’s no good. I sleep here as well and all my dreams are violent. I’m in the middle of a murder trial now, but that’s all right. Do you know what’s worse? Divorce. When you think how they started out full of wonder and love, and they go on for pages and pages accusing each other and making themselves out to be right. And if someone just kindly and simply asked them what it’s really all about they wouldn’t know. They quarrelled about a green salad. They quarrelled about a word. They quarrelled about nothing. But the pain. Look at me. No woman’s going to want me after all this. No one even wants to be friends with me.



AGNES

I’m so sorry.



SOLICITOR

You should be. And what do people live on? They don’t earn enough to get married so they’re always in debt. (To OFFICER.) What do you want?



OFFICER

I just wanted to ask if Victoria’s left.



SOLICITOR

No, she definitely hasn’t. Why are you pointing at my cupboard?



OFFICER

I thought the door looked like . . .



SOLICITOR

Oh no no no.





Bells.



OFFICER

Is it a funeral?



SOLICITOR

No, it’s an honours ceremony. And I’m going to be given an honour. Would you like to be knighted for something or other?



OFFICER

Yes, why not. It’s something to do.





Ceremony.





SOLICITOR goes forward but is refused.





AGNES enters. The coat is clean.



AGNES

Look how clean it is. But what’s the matter? Didn’t you get it?



SOLICITOR

I’m not good enough.



AGNES

Why? because you do legal aid? because you get people off ? and if they’re found guilty you get them shorter sentences. Some criminals do do terrible things of course but I’m still sorry for them.



SOLICITOR

Don’t say anything against them. I’ll always defend them.



AGNES

But why do they hurt each other?



SOLICITOR

They can’t help it.



AGNES

Maybe we could make them better. Together.



SOLICITOR

No one’s going to listen to us. If only the gods knew what it’s like.



AGNES

They will, I promise. Do you know what I can see in this mirror? The world the right way round. Because usually it’s the wrong way round.



SOLICITOR

How did it get the wrong way round?



AGNES

When it was copied.



SOLICITOR

Yes, I always thought there was something wrong with the copy. I sometimes think there’s an original which was much better and then I feel really depressed. Everyone does. Like a glass splinter in your eye.



AGNES

Let me play for you.





She plays organ but we hear voices.



VOICES

Whoever’s up there

have mercy on us

save us and spare us

please don’t be angry.





5. Cave

SOLICITOR, AGNES.

SOLICITOR

Where are we?



AGNES

What can you hear?



SOLICITOR

Drips. Drops.



AGNES

Tears. What else?



SOLICITOR

Sighs. Wailing.



AGNES

So why all this complaining? What’s it about? Don’t people enjoy anything?



SOLICITOR

Love. They do like love. A partner and a home.



AGNES

Can I try it?



SOLICITOR

With me?



AGNES

With you. You know all the mistakes we mustn’t make.



SOLICITOR

I’m poor.



AGNES

That doesn’t matter so long as we love each other. And beauty doesn’t cost anything.



SOLICITOR

There are things I hate, and you might turn out to like them.



AGNES

Then we’ll both have to change a bit.



SOLICITOR

And what if we get tired of each other?



AGNES

We’ll have a baby.



SOLICITOR

Would you really have me? poor, ugly? a failure?



AGNES

Yes, let’s share our lives.



SOLICITOR

Let’s do that.





6. Room (One-Room Flat at Solicitor’s)

AGNES, KRISTIN.

KRISTIN is pasting the windows shut to keep out draughts.

KRISTIN

Pasting, pasting.



AGNES

You’re shutting out the air. I’m suffocating.



KRISTIN

There’s just one little crack left.



AGNES

I can’t breathe.



KRISTIN

Pasting, pasting.





SOLICITOR enters.



SOLICITOR

That’s good, Kristin. It saves money on heating.



AGNES

It’s as if you’re sticking my mouth together.



SOLICITOR

Is she asleep?



AGNES

At last.



SOLICITOR

All that screaming drives away the clients.



AGNES

What can we do?



SOLICITOR

Nothing.



AGNES

We need a bigger place.



SOLICITOR

We can’t afford it.



AGNES

Do you mind if I open the window? I can’t breathe.



SOLICITOR

You’ll let the heat out, it’s too cold.



AGNES

I know, let’s scrub the office so it looks better.



SOLICITOR

You haven’t got the strength and nor have I, and Kristin has to keep pasting, she’s got to paste the whole building tight, every crack in the ceiling, the floor, the walls.



AGNES

I don’t mind being poor. I just don’t like dirt.



SOLICITOR

Being poor can lead to dirt.



AGNES

It’s worse than the worst I imagined.



SOLICITOR

Things aren’t too bad. We’ve plenty to eat.



AGNES

Lentils?



SOLICITOR

Lentils are good for you.



AGNES

I hate lentils.



SOLICITOR

Why didn’t you say so?



AGNES

I was trying to put up with it because I love you.



SOLICITOR

Then I must give up lentils. We both have to change.



AGNES

What can we eat? Fish? You hate fish.



SOLICITOR

Fish is expensive.



AGNES

This is harder than I expected.



SOLICITOR

You see? And the baby, who should make us closer, just makes things worse.



AGNES

Beloved, I’m going to die in this air, in this room, looking down on the backyard, the baby screaming all night, no sleep, the neighbours shouting. I’m going to die.



SOLICITOR

Poor little flower. No light, no air.



AGNES

And you say there are people who are worse off.



SOLICITOR

I’m one of the lucky ones.



AGNES

I think I’d be all right if I had something beautiful.



SOLICITOR

I know you want flowers, you want that azalea you saw in the shop, but it costs as much as forty pounds of potatoes.



AGNES

I’d go without food if I could have a flower.



SOLICITOR

There is a kind of beauty you can have for nothing. And not having it really hurts if you’re a man who loves beauty.



AGNES

What is it?



SOLICITOR

You’ll be angry.



AGNES

We’ve agreed we’ll never get angry.



SOLICITOR

Yes, we’ve agreed we can say anything to each other but not in that angry voice. Do you know what I mean? You’ve never heard it, have you?



AGNES

You’ll never hear it from me.



SOLICITOR

And never from me.



AGNES

So say it.



SOLICITOR

Well, when I go into someone’s house, the first thing I notice is how the curtains hang. If any of the hooks are missing, I walk out. Then I look at the chairs. If they’re straight, I’ll stay. Then I look at the lamps. If the shades are askew, the whole house is off-balance. And this is the beauty you can have for nothing.



AGNES

Not in that tone of voice.



SOLICITOR

It wasn’t.



AGNES

Yes it was.



SOLICITOR

For god’s sake.



AGNES

What did you say?



SOLICITOR

I’m sorry, Agnes. But I mind your untidiness just as much as you mind the dirt. And I didn’t like to do any tidying up in case you thought I was criticising. Ugh. Shall we stop this?



AGNES

Marriage is really difficult, isn’t it? You have to be an angel.



SOLICITOR

Yes, ideally.



AGNES

I might start hating you after this.



SOLICITOR

That would be horrible. But let’s see it coming and not let it happen. I’ll never say anything about untidiness again. Though I do hate it.



AGNES

And I’ll eat lentil soup though I hate that.



SOLICITOR

So a life of what we hate. That’s going to be fun.



AGNES

I’m really sorry for people.



SOLICITOR

You see?



AGNES

Yes but let’s try to find a way through. We can see what the problems are.



SOLICITOR

Yes, we’re intelligent enough to understand each other.



AGNES

If little things go wrong we can have a laugh.



SOLICITOR

Of course we can. I saw something this morning in the paper – where is the paper?



AGNES

What paper?



SOLICITOR

Do we get more than one paper?



AGNES

Laugh about it. And not that tone of voice. I used it to wrap up the potato peelings when I threw them away.



SOLICITOR

Oh for god’s sake.



AGNES

Please smile. There was an article which made me really upset.



SOLICITOR

And which I agreed with. Well. I’ll smile, I’ll smile till you see my back teeth. I’ll be nice and not say what I think and agree to everything and pretend. So you threw away my paper. I see. Look, I’m tidying up again which makes you angry. Agnes, this is impossible.



AGNES

Yes, it is.



SOLICITOR

But we’ve got to stay together because of the baby.



AGNES

You’re right. For the baby. Oh. Oh. We’ve got to stay together.



SOLICITOR

And now it’s time to go and see some clients, who are all desperate for me to keep them out of prison and make someone else go instead. They’re beside themselves.



AGNES

Poor poor people. And the pasting.



KRISTIN

Pasting. Pasting.





SOLICITOR is fiddling with the door.



AGNES

Don’t make the bolt squeak. It’s as if you’re squeezing my heart.



SOLICITOR

Squeezing. Squeezing.



AGNES

Don’t do it.



SOLICITOR

Squeezing.



AGNES

No.



SOLICITOR

Squeez –





OFFICER enters and adjusts the bolt.



OFFICER

Allow me.



SOLICITOR

Please. Since you’ve got a knighthood.



OFFICER

Yes, life’s all before me. Fame and glory.



SOLICITOR

What will you live on?



OFFICER

Live on?



SOLICITOR

Don’t you need a home? clothes? food?



OFFICER

That all sorts itself out so long as someone loves you.



SOLICITOR

I suppose so. I suppose so. Paste, Kristin. Paste till they can’t breathe.





SOLICITOR goes out.



KRISTIN

Pasting. Pasting till they can’t breathe.



OFFICER

Will you come away with me?



AGNES

Yes but where to?



OFFICER

The seaside. It’s summer there. Sunshine, flowers, children –



AGNES

I want to go.



OFFICER

Come on.





SOLICITOR comes back.



SOLICITOR

Look, hairpins all over the floor again.



OFFICER

He’s noticed the hairpins too.



SOLICITOR

As well as what? Look, two sides, one pin. Two and one. If I straighten it out, it’s one. If I bend it it’s two but it’s still one. It means ‘these two are one.’ But if I snap it – then they’re two, two.



OFFICER

To break it the prongs have to go apart. If they get closer, it holds.



SOLICITOR

And if they’re parallel they never meet.



OFFICER

It’s perfect and impossible. A straight line which is two parallels.



SOLICITOR

A bolt which locks when it’s open. And when I close the door, I open a way out for you, Agnes.





SOLICITOR goes.



AGNES

So?





7. Quarantine Station by the Sea

Scorched earth.

Pigsties.

In the distance, on the other side of the bay, a beautiful seashore, villas, boats.

RICH FAT SICK exercising on machines like instruments of torture.

AGNES, OFFICER, QUARANTINE MASTER.

QUARANTINE MASTER is wearing a monster mask.

OFFICER

We’re in the wrong place.



Q MASTER

Aren’t you the one who’s waiting outside the theatre?



OFFICER

Yes, I am.



Q MASTER

Have you got the door open yet?



OFFICER

No, we’re still in the middle of the appeal. The billsticker’s gone off with his net so it’s taking a while to get all the evidence. But the glazier’s put new windows in the tower and it’s grown another ten floors. It’s been a good year for growing, hot and wet.



Q MASTER

Not as hot as here.



OFFICER

How hot do you keep your furnaces then?



Q MASTER

Sixty centigrade to disinfect for cholera.



OFFICER

Cholera? is there cholera?



Q MASTER

Didn’t you know?



OFFICER

Yes, I do know of course, but I forget about it.



Q MASTER

I wish I could forget. What I’d really like is to forget myself. That’s why I go to parties.



OFFICER

Why, what’s happened to you?



Q MASTER

If I talk about it they say I’m boasting and if I don’t they say I’m a hypocrite.



OFFICER

Is that why you dress up as a monster?



Q MASTER

Yes, just a little more monstrous than I am.



OFFICER

Who’s this?



Q MASTER

A writer with an appointment for a mud bath. It gives him a thick skin.





Enter WRITER.



WRITER

Lina.





LINA enters.





Lina, let Miss Agnes have a look at you. She knew you ten years ago when you were young, happy and even pretty. Look at her now. Five children, hunger, beatings. All that beauty destroyed by duty, which we’re told produces inner tranquillity reflected in the –



Q MASTER

Shut up, shut up.



AGNES

Tell me what’s wrong.



LINA

I’ll get into trouble.



AGNES

Who’s cruel to you?



LINA

I’ll get a beating.



WRITER

That’s what it’s like, Agnes.



OFFICER

Visitors.





HE and SHE are passing in a boat.





Look, perfect happiness. Young love.





HE sings.



HE

When I was a child

I was lonely here.

Same sea, same woods, same

sky, same sun, but all

new now with my love.



OFFICER

It’s Victoria.



Q MASTER

What?



OFFICER

It’s his Victoria. I still have my own.

Raise the quarantine flag. I’ll pull them in.





QUARANTINE MASTER waves a yellow flag.





OFFICER tugs a rope, pulling the boat in.





Hold it.





HE and SHE react to quarantine station with disgust.



Q MASTER

Yes yes, of course you don’t like it. But all passengers arriving from infected areas have to land here.



WRITER

How can you do this to people in love? Don’t touch them.



HE

What have we done wrong?



Q MASTER

Nothing. You can still have a bad time.



SHE

We’d only just started to be happy.



HE

How long do we have to wait?



Q MASTER

Six weeks.



SHE

Then we’d rather go home.



HE

We can’t stay here. Scorched earth.



WRITER

Don’t worry, you’re in love. And that’s even stronger than sulphur.



Q MASTER

I’m lighting the sulphur now. This way please.



SHE

My dress isn’t colourfast.



Q MASTER

No, it’s going to turn white. And so will the roses.



HE

So will your face. In six weeks.



SHE

(To OFFICER.) I suppose you’re happy now.



OFFICER

No. Not really. Seeing you happy did make me feel a bit low but I’ve got a knighthood now so I’ve got that status, ha ha, oh yes. And this autumn I’ll start teaching. Teaching boys what I learned all through my childhood. And now I’ll teach it all my adult life and all my old age, the same stuff. What’s twice two? How many times does two go into four? Till I get my pension and wander round with nothing to do, waiting for meals and newspapers till I’m taken off to the crematorium to be burnt. And Victoria, whom I loved and wanted to be happy, she is happy and that makes me miserable.



SHE

So how can I be happy? Perhaps you’ll feel better while I’m a prisoner here. Does that help?



OFFICER

I can’t be happy if you’re miserable. Oh.



HE

And how can I be happy now I realise what I’ve done to you?



OFFICER

I’m sorry for all of us. Oh.



ALL THREE

Oh.



AGNES

Life’s really difficult. I’m sorry for all of them.



ALL THREE

Oh.





8. Outside a Ballroom by the Sea

The quarantine station is in the distance on the other side of the bay.

MAIDS are outside watching the dancing through a window.

Ugly EDITH is sitting outside.

A piano.

A yellow house.

Children in summer clothes playing.

A jetty with boats and flags.

In the bay, a warship.

Bare trees and snow.

AGNES and OFFICER enter.

AGNES

This is the place we meant to come to. Every day’s a holiday and parties start in the morning. (To MAIDS.) Why don’t you go inside and dance?



MAIDS

Us?



OFFICER

They’re the help.



AGNES

Oops. But why isn’t Edith dancing?





EDITH hides face in hands.



OFFICER

Don’t ask. She’s been sitting in there for three hours and nobody’s asked her to dance.





OFFICER goes into the yellow house.



AGNES

Parties are a cruel kind of fun.





MOTHER in party dress comes out of the ballroom.



MOTHER

Why don’t you come inside? I keep telling you.



EDITH

I know I’m ugly and no one wants to dance with me but I don’t have to sit in there offering myself.





EDITH plays the piano – Bach Toccata con Fuga 10. Music from ballroom rises to compete, then is drowned out by it. GUESTS come out of the ballroom and everyone listens to her playing.





Naval LIEUTENANT seizes ALICE, one of the guests, and takes her off to the jetty.



LIEUTENANT

Come on, quick.





EDITH stops playing.





In the yellow house.





SCHOOLBOYS, OFFICER sitting among them, TEACHER.



TEACHER

Twice two.





OFFICER can’t remember.





Stand up when I ask you a question.



OFFICER

Twice two. I think . . . It’s two two.



TEACHER

So you didn’t do your homework?



OFFICER

Yes I did. I do know it. I can’t say it.



TEACHER

You know it but can’t say it? Maybe I can help you. (Pulls his hair.)



OFFICER

This is terrible.



TEACHER

It’s terrible that a big boy like you has no ambition.



OFFICER

A big boy, yes I am big, I’m bigger than the others. I’m grown up, I’ve finished school. I’ve got a knighthood. So why am I sitting here? Haven’t I just been given a knighthood?



TEACHER

Yes but you have to sit here until you get a sense of responsibility.



OFFICER

Yes, you have to be responsible. Twice two . . . equals two and I can prove that by analogy. One times one is one. So two times two is two.



TEACHER

Logical but wrong.



OFFICER

Logic can’t be wrong. Let’s try again. One goes into one once. So two goes into two twice.



TEACHER

Then what’s one times three?



OFFICER

Three.



TEACHER

And it follows logically that two times three is also three.



OFFICER

No, that can’t be right . . . it can’t be . . . or perhaps . . . No, I haven’t got a sense of responsibility.



TEACHER

You certainly haven’t.



OFFICER

So how long do I have to go on sitting here?



TEACHER

How long? Do you believe time and space exist? If time exists, you should be able to say what it is. What’s time?



OFFICER

Time? I can’t exactly say but I know what it is. So I can know what twice two is and not be able to say it. Can you tell me what time is?



TEACHER

Of course.



BOYS

Then say it.



TEACHER

Time flies while we speak. So time is something that flies while I’m speaking.



BOY

You’re speaking now and I’m going to fly, so I’m time.





BOY flies.



TEACHER

That’s certainly logical.



OFFICER

But it must be wrong because he can’t be time.



TEACHER

That’s logical.



OFFICER

So logically, logic must be wrong.



TEACHER

But if logic’s wrong, everything’s crazy and how can I teach it?



OFFICER

You can’t, you’re an old idiot.



TEACHER

Don’t be impertinent.



OFFICER

I’m an officer, I’m an officer, and I don’t see why I’m sitting here with schoolboys getting told off.



TEACHER

Where’s your sense of responsibility?





QUARANTINE MASTER enters.



Q MASTER

The quarantine’s beginning.



OFFICER

He’s making me learn my tables and I’ve got a knighthood.



Q MASTER

So why don’t you leave?



OFFICER

I can’t.



TEACHER

I thought not. Try.



OFFICER

Save me. Save me from his eyes.



Q MASTER

Come on then. Come and help us dance. We must have a dance before the plague breaks out.



OFFICER

And after that the warship’s going to sail?



Q MASTER

It’s going to sail first. There’ll be tears.



OFFICER

There’s always tears. When it goes and when it comes back. Let’s go.





They leave TEACHER teaching.





MAIDS and EDITH go sadly to the jetty.





AGNES, OFFICER, QUARANTINE MASTER.



AGNES

This is paradise. But isn’t anyone happy here?



OFFICER

Yes, listen. They’ve just got married.





Enter NEWLYWEDS.



HUSBAND

I’m so happy I could die.



WIFE

Die? why?



HUSBAND

Because bliss burns out. And that means I can’t bear it.



WIFE

Let’s die together. Now.



HUSBAND

Die? Yes. Because I’m frightened of happiness.





They go.



AGNES

People are so fucked up.



OFFICER

Tell me about it.





Now here’s somebody everyone wants to be.





Enter BLIND MAN.





He owns a hundred villas, he owns the whole coast. All the beaches, forests, all the fish in the sea, birds in the air, animals in the woods. Thousands of people pay him rent and the sun rises over his waves and sets over his hills.



AGNES

And I suppose he thinks he’s got something to complain about?



OFFICER

He does because he can’t see.



Q MASTER

He’s blind.



AGNES

The one they want to be.



OFFICER

He’s come to wave goodbye to the warship, his son’s on it.



BLIND MAN

I can’t see but I can hear. I can hear the anchor tearing the seabed like when you tear a fishhook out of a fish and the heart comes out of its throat. My son’s being sent overseas. I can’t go with him except in my thoughts. The chains are squeaking . . . and something’s fluttering . . . wet handkerchiefs . . . and there’s sobbing and sniffing, but it could be the small waves against the nets . . . but it could be the girls on the beach, the girls they’ve left behind them. I once asked a child whose father was at sea why the sea was salt, and he said because sailors cry. Why do they cry? Because they’re so far away. And they put their handkerchiefs on the masts to dry. So then I asked him why do people cry when they’re sad? And he said because they have to wash their eyes so they can see better.





Ship sails. GIRLS waving sadly.





Signal flag with red raised on the ship. ALICE waves happily.



AGNES

What does the flag mean?



OFFICER

It means yes. It’s the lieutenant’s yes in red, like blood on the sky’s blue uniform.



AGNES

What’s no?



OFFICER

Blue like the sick blood in his veins. See how happy Alice is.



AGNES

And how Edith’s crying.



BLIND MAN

I met his mother and she left me. I still had my son and now he’s gone too.



AGNES

But I’m sure he’ll come back.



BLIND MAN

Who’s that? I’ve heard that voice in my dreams. I used to hear it on the first day of the summer holidays. I heard it the first time I made love to my wife. I heard it the night my son was born. It’s like a south wind. It’s like angels.





SOLICITOR enters and whispers to BLIND MAN.





I see.



SOLICITOR

Yes, that’s the sort of person she is.





Right, Agnes, you’ve seen a lot but you haven’t tried the worst yet.



AGNES

What’s that?



SOLICITOR

Repetition. Going back. Doing it all over again. Come on.



AGNES

Where?



SOLICITOR

To your duties.



AGNES

What duties?



SOLICITOR

Everything you always hated.



AGNES

The lentils and dirty clothes?



SOLICITOR

Yes, it’s washday and we’re washing the handkerchiefs.



AGNES

Do I have to do it all over again?



SOLICITOR

Life’s all repetition. Look at the teacher. Right, let’s go home.



AGNES

I’d rather be dead.



SOLICITOR

Yes but you’re not allowed to kill yourself. It’s against the law and you don’t get a proper funeral and then you’re damned.



AGNES

I’m finding it really hard being a person.



ALL

See.



AGNES

I’m not coming. I want to stay here. Compared to life with you, this is paradise.





Two BUILDING WORKERS.



BW1

This is hell.



BW2

Forty degrees in the shade.



BW1

Shall we go for a swim?



BW2

We’ll be arrested. We can’t swim here.



BW1

We could pick some fruit.



BW2

No, we’ll be arrested.



BW1

I’m not working in this heat. I’m off.



BW2

You’ll be arrested. And anyway you’ll starve.



BW1

(To AGNES.) So, what do you think? What’s your answer?



AGNES

I’m not sure yet. Is it true they’re not allowed to swim here?



SOLICITOR

They can try to drown themselves. But then they get beaten up at the police station.



AGNES

Can’t they go further down the coast and swim in the countryside?



SOLICITOR

It’s all fenced off.



AGNES

No, I mean where it doesn’t belong to anyone.



SOLICITOR

It all belongs to someone.



AGNES

But not the sea?



SOLICITOR

Everything. You can’t moor a boat without being charged for it. Good, isn’t it?



AGNES

Why don’t people do something about it?



SOLICITOR

Some of them do but they end up in prison or a psychiatric ward.



AGNES

Who puts them in prison?



SOLICITOR

The great and the good, the law-abiding citizens and the hard-working families.



AGNES

Who puts them in the psychiatric ward?



SOLICITOR

Their own despair.



AGNES

Maybe it has to be like this.



SOLICITOR

That’s exactly what some people think.





GENTLEMAN and LADY cross.



LADY

Are you coming to play cards?



GENT

No, I need some exercise so I can eat dinner.



SOLICITOR

Please don’t think I’m a socialist but does there have to be such a big difference?



AGNES

It isn’t paradise.



SOLICITOR

So come back with me.



AGNES

No, I’m not going back to dirt and lentils and arguments. I want to go back where I came from. But first we’ve got to get the door open. I want them to open the door.



SOLICITOR

Then you have to go back the way you came and go through everything again.



AGNES

All right, if I have to. But first I’m going somewhere quiet where there’s no people because I’m confused. I will see you later. (To WRITER.) Come with me.





9. Cave

AGNES, WRITER.

WRITER

Where have you brought me?



AGNES

Away from all that. To the edge of the world. To a cave where the gods listen to people’s complaints.



WRITER

How? Here?



AGNES

Look, the cave’s shaped like a shell. And an ear is shaped like a shell. You know how you can listen to a shell and hear the sound of your own blood and the thoughts in your brain? So if you can hear that in a small shell, imagine what you can hear in this big one.



WRITER

I can only hear the wind.



AGNES

I’ll tell you what it’s saying.





Over the cities

with their foul smoke and

over the sea to

wash our dusty feet

and shake out our wings.

People aren’t evil

and people aren’t good.

They live how they can

one day at a time.

They come out of dust

they go back to dust,

dusty feet, no wings,

and whose fault is that?



WRITER

I’ve heard this before.



AGNES

Sh. The winds are still singing.





Hear us in autumn

crying down chimneys

or moaning through the

cracks of windows, when

the rain’s beating down.

Hear us in winter

in forests in the

snow, at sea hear us

in the ship’s rigging.

We learnt to howl from

people, we heard them

in bed sick, on the

ground in a battle,

we heard their pain and

that’s why we’re wailing.



WRITER

I thought I . . .



AGNES

Sh. Now the waves are singing.





We rock the winds to

sleep, like wet flames we

burn quench make destroy,

rocking them to sleep.





Look what’s been washed up from wrecked ships. Rowlocks. Bailers. A lifejacket. And part of a guided-missile launcher.



WRITER

Here’s a nameboard. Enduring Freedom. That’s from the ship we saw sail with the BLIND MAN’s son. And the lieutenant Alice and Edith loved.



AGNES

Didn’t I dream all that? There was a BLIND MAN and Alice and Edith. And the quarantine and the sulphur and the honours and the solicitor and Victoria and the tower and the officer . . . I dreamt that.



WRITER

I wrote it.



AGNES

Then you know what poetry is.



WRITER

I know what a dream is. What’s poetry?



AGNES

It’s not real but maybe it’s more than real. It’s dreaming while you’re awake.



WRITER

Everyone thinks it’s playing and nonsense.



AGNES

That’s just as well or everyone would lie about and you’d never even have invented agriculture.



WRITER

It’s easy for you to say. You don’t belong here, you belong in the sky.



AGNES

Yes, I’ve been here too long. I can’t fly any more. (Raises her arms.) I’m sinking. (To gods.) Help me. (Silence.) I can’t hear anything any more. I’ve lost contact. I’m stuck here.



WRITER

Were you planning to . . . go up soon?



AGNES

I’ll have to burn off the dust. It won’t wash off in the sea. Why?



WRITER

Because I have a sort of petition.



AGNES

What about?



WRITER

From all us people to god, the gods, whatever.



AGNES

And you want me to . . . ?



WRITER

Take it with you.



AGNES

Will you say it?



WRITER

Yes, all right.



AGNES

Say it then.



WRITER

I’d rather hear you say it.



AGNES

How can I read it?



WRITER

Read my mind.



AGNES

Yes, I’ll say it.





Why does it hurt to

give birth? why do babies

cry? why are we just

animals and not gods?





Sh. No one understands what life is.





We race over stones

and thistles, if we pick

flowers they’re someone

else’s, if we’re happy

it makes someone sad,

if we’re sad it doesn’t

make them happier.

And then we just die.

This isn’t a good tone to take with

gods.



WRITER

How can I find words

to tell them what it’s like?

Put it your own way.



AGNES

Yes, I’ll try.



WRITER

What’s floating over there? Is it a buoy to warn the ships?



AGNES

Yes, it sings when there’s danger.



WRITER

I think the sea’s rising now. I can hear the waves thundering. And what’s that? A ship . . . on the rocks. Shouldn’t the buoy be making some sort of noise? Look, the sea’s rising. We’re going to be trapped in the cave. That’s the ship’s siren. It’s going to be wrecked. The buoy –





Buoy sound.





The crew’s waving to us. But we’re going to die too.



AGNES

Don’t you want to be released from this terrible life?



WRITER

Yes of course but not now. Not in the water.





CREW on ship singing.



CREW

Christ our Lord.



WRITER

No one can hear them.



AGNES

Who’s that out there?



WRITER

Walking on the water? There’s only one person who’s ever done that.



CREW

Christ our Lord?



AGNES

Is that him?



WRITER

It is, it is, it’s the one who was crucified.



AGNES

Why was he crucified?



WRITER

Because he wanted to set people free, I think.



AGNES

Who wanted to crucify him?



WRITER

The great and the good, the law-abiding citizens and the hard-working families.



AGNES

This world is so odd.



WRITER

The sea’s rising. It’s dark. The storm’s getting up.





CREW scream.





And the crew are screaming with terror. They’ve seen him walking on the water to save them and they’re so terrified they’re jumping overboard. Now they’re screaming because they’re going to die.





Waves threaten to drown AGNES and WRITER in the cave.



AGNES

If I could be sure it was a ship . . .



WRITER

You know . . . I don’t think it is a ship. It’s a house with trees outside . . . and a telephone tower . . . a tower that goes right up into the sky. A tower with wires to take messages to the gods.



AGNES

They don’t need wires.



WRITER

No, it’s not a house, not a telephone tower, can you see it?



AGNES

What do you see?



WRITER

It’s a plain covered with snow. It’s the army’s training ground. The sun’s shining behind a church and the spire’s shadow’s on the snow. Here come the soldiers. They’re marching on the church, marching up the spire, I think the one who steps on the weathercock’s going to die. They’re getting nearer. The corporal’s leading them. Haha. Here comes the shadow of a cloud rushing across, blots it all out, the steeple’s shadow’s gone.





10. Outside the Stage Door

AGNES, OFFICER, STAGE DOOR KEEPER.

AGNES

Have the great and the good arrived yet?



SD KEEPER

Not yet.



AGNES

Then call them at once because we’ve got to open the door. Everyone thinks the meaning of life is in there.





STAGE DOOR KEEPER blows whistle.





And don’t forget the glazier with his diamond.





THEATRE PEOPLE enter.





OFFICER enters with roses, as at the beginning.



OFFICER

Victoria!



SD KEEPER

She’ll be right down.



OFFICER

That’s good. The taxi’s waiting, I’ve booked a table, the champagne’s on ice. I have to give you a hug. (He hugs STAGE DOOR KEEPER.) Victoria!



VICTORIA

(Off.) Coming.



OFFICER

Good. I’ll wait.



WRITER

You know that feeling that something’s happened before.



AGNES

Yes, me too.



WRITER

Maybe I dreamt it.



AGNES

Or wrote it?



WRITER

Or wrote it.



AGNES

Then you know what poetry is.



WRITER

I know what a dream is.



AGNES

I think we’ve said this before too.



WRITER

You’ll soon be able to work out what reality is.



AGNES

Or dreaming.



WRITER

Or poetry.





Enter CHAIRMAN OF INQUIRY, BISHOP, PSYCHOANALYST, SCIENTIST and BARRISTER.



CHAIR

I am here to chair an inquiry into the opening of the door. What do you think, bishop?



BISHOP

I don’t think, I believe, and I believe the door should not be opened because it conceals a dangerous truth.



PSYCH

The patient fears the truth. And the analyst helps him live with it. In an ordinary unhappy way.



SCIENTIST

What is ‘the truth’? Forty-six chromosomes. Thirty thousand genes.



BARRISTER

It’s what I can prove beyond a reasonable doubt.



PSYCH

Truth is what you discover about yourself after years of lying on the couch.



SCIENTIST

That’s not scientific truth. It’s talk.





BISHOP cheers.



PSYCH

What are you cheering for? you hate science. You think the world was made in six days ten thousand years ago.





SCIENTIST cheers.



BISHOP

What are you cheering for? You only know what’s under your microscope. Our truth is always true and yours constantly changes.



SCIENTIST

Idiot.





Fight.



CHAIR

The truth is outside the terms of reference of this inquiry. Perhaps we should move to the opening of the door.



BISHOP

I am the way, the truth and the light.



PSYCH

The Oedipus complex.



SCIENTIST

The prefrontal cortex.



BARRISTER

Prove it, prove it, prove it.



ALL

(Cheer.) The door’s open.



CHAIR

What’s behind the door?



GLAZIER

I can’t see anything.



CHAIR

No, he might not perhaps be capable. Bishop, what’s behind the door?



BISHOP

Nothing. That’s the answer. God created everything out of nothing.



PSYCH

The feeling of nothingness can be a symptom of –



SCIENTIST

There’s simply nothing there.



OFFICER

Nothing there?



BARRISTER

I doubt that. This is a case of conspiracy to deceive. I appeal to the great and the good, the law-abiding citizens and the hardworking families.



ALL

We’ve been deceived.



CHAIR

Who has deceived you?



ALL

She has.



CHAIR

What did you mean by opening the door?



AGNES

If I told you, you wouldn’t believe me.



SCIENTIST

The simple fact is there’s nothing there.



AGNES

Nothing at all. But you don’t understand it.



SCIENTIST

What is there to understand? It’s a load of bollocks.



ALL

Bollocks. Get her.



BARRISTER

I grant you a conditional discharge provided you leave the country. You can go back where you came from. With what you got out of it.



AGNES

(To WRITER.) I’m sorry for them.



WRITER

Are you serious?



AGNES

Always serious.



WRITER

Sorry for the hard-working families, the law-abiding citizens and the great and the good?



AGNES

Them most of all. But what did he mean, what I got out of it?



WRITER

Don’t worry about it. He was just talking.



AGNES

What I got out of coming to earth? I’m hurt by that.



WRITER

That’s why he said it.



AGNES

Yes but –



ALL

She refuses to answer.



CHAIR

Get her.



AGNES

I’ve already answered.



ALL

She thinks she knows the answer, get her.



AGNES

Come on and I’ll – a long way away – I’ll tell you the secret where no one can see us or hear us. Because –





SOLICITOR enters.



SOLICITOR

Have you forgotten your duties?



AGNES

No. But I have higher duties.



SOLICITOR

And your daughter?



AGNES

My daughter. Anything else?



SOLICITOR

She’s crying for you.



AGNES

This pain, what is it?



SOLICITOR

Don’t you know?



AGNES

No.



SOLICITOR

Conscience.



AGNES

Conscience?



SOLICITOR

Yes and you’ll get it every time you hurt someone else.



AGNES

Isn’t there a cure?



SOLICITOR

Do your duty.



AGNES

What if I’ve got two duties?



SOLICITOR

Do one first, then the other.



AGNES

The highest first. So you look after our daughter, and I’ll do my duty.



SOLICITOR

She misses you. Don’t you understand? someone is suffering because of you.



AGNES

Now I’m torn in two.



SOLICITOR

This is one of life’s little troubles, you see?



AGNES

It hurts.



WRITER

If you knew what grief I’d caused, you wouldn’t want to hold my hand.



AGNES

Why? what?



WRITER

I did what I felt was my duty to my vocation and completely fucked up everyone who loved me. I gave my father a heart attack, my mother a nervous breakdown and stopped seeing my best friend because he was exploiting the people I was writing for. And it’s no help thinking you did the right thing because next minute you think you were wrong. That’s what life’s like.



AGNES

Come with me.



SOLICITOR

You have a child.



AGNES

Goodbye.





11. Outside the Tower

Like the first scene, except the flowers are now bluebells. A chrysanthemum bud on top of the tower is about to open.

AGNES and WRITER.

AGNES

Soon I’m going up out of this world. I’ll use fire. It’s what you call dying and you’re frightened of it.



WRITER

It’s fear of the unknown.



AGNES

But you do know. Have you always doubted everything?



WRITER

No, sometimes I’m certain of something. Then it goes again. Like a dream when you wake up.



AGNES

It’s not easy being alive.



WRITER

You know that now?



AGNES

Yes, I do now.



WRITER

But weren’t you going to tell me the answer to whatever the question is.



AGNES

What’s the point? You don’t believe what you’re told.



WRITER

I will believe you because I know who you are.



AGNES

All right, listen. (Whispers.)



WRITER

My dream.





AGNES whispers.





And then ?





AGNES whispers.





What about peace? and rest?



AGNES

Don’t ask any more. I can’t say any more. Because everything’s ready for my death. Flowers. Candles. White sheets over the windows. And the fire.



WRITER

Why are you so calm? Are you someone who can’t feel pain?



AGNES

I’ve felt yours. I’ve felt everyone’s.



WRITER

Tell me what you’ve felt.



AGNES

Could you tell me? Could words ever do it?



WRITER

No, words are useless. I’ve always known what I write doesn’t say what I mean so when I get praised I feel ashamed.



AGNES

Look into my eyes.



WRITER

I can’t bear it.



AGNES

Then how would you bear my words if I spoke my own language?



WRITER

But tell me before you go. What was the worst thing about being down here?



AGNES

Just existing. Knowing my sight was blurred by my eyes, my hearing dulled by my ears, and my bright thought trapped in the grey maze of a brain. Have you seen a brain?



WRITER

And you’re telling me that’s what’s wrong with us? How else can we be?



AGNES

First I’ll get rid of the dust on my feet.





Puts shoes on fire.





Others enter, put things on fire, go.



SD KEEPER

Do you mind if I burn my coat?



OFFICER

My roses. Well, thorns, really.



BILLSTICK

The posters can go but not my net.



GLAZIER

The diamond which opened the door. Goodbye.



SOLICITOR

My great lawsuit about asbestos poisoning.



Q MASTER

A small contribution, my monster mask.



VICTORIA

My beauty, my sadness.



EDITH

My ugliness, my sadness.



BLIND MAN

My hands were my eyes.



WRITER

Sometimes when you’re about to die, isn’t your whole life meant to go past you in a flash? Is this it?



AGNES

It is for me. Goodbye.



WRITER

What about last words?



AGNES

I can’t. Emotions don’t fit into words.





KRISTIN enters.



KRISTIN

Pasting, pasting, till there’s nothing left to paste.



WRITER

And if heaven cracked open you’d paste it shut. Go away.



KRISTIN

Aren’t there some windows for me in the tower?



WRITER

No, Kristin.



KRISTIN

Then I’ll go.





KRISTIN goes.



AGNES

Goodbye, this is the

end, goodbye writer,

you live well floating

in the air, plunging

into the mud but

not getting stuck there.





When you’re leaving you

love what you’ve lost and

you’re sorry for what

you’ve done and far more

what you didn’t do.

I know what it’s like.

You want to stay and

you want to go and





Goodbye. Tell people

I won’t forget them.

I’ll tell the gods

what being alive is.

Because I’m sorry.

Goodbye.





She goes into the tower.





The tower burns.





The bud bursts into a giant chrysanthemum.





End.





August Strindberg

Born in Stockholm in 1849, Strindberg studied medicine at the University of Uppsala, but soon turned to writing plays. As assistant librarian at the Royal Library, his personal affairs – and his creativity as a writer – took on an intensity which persisted throughout his life. As novels – The Red Room, Son of a Servant – and plays – Master Olof, The Father, Comrades – poured out of him, he fell in love with the first of a succession of women, many of them actresses. Siri von Essen divorced her husband to marry Strindberg in 1877 and had three children by him. As their marriage deteriorated, she probably provided the inspiration for Miss Julie, which premiered in Copenhagen in 1889, only to be closed down by the Danish censor.

In 1890 The Father was staged in Berlin, where Strindberg had settled after divorcing Siri. There he met Frida Uhl, marrying her in 1893 but almost immediately falling out with her. Returning to Sweden, he began work on the autobiog raphical Inferno, and in 1898 completed the first part of what was to become his dramatic trilogy, To Damascus. He met his third wife, the Norwegian actress Harriet Bosse, in 1900: in the spate of creativity that followed, he wrote Easter, The Dance of Death and A Dream Play (written in 1901, published in 1902), and then divorced her. Many of his plays remained unstaged until the early 1900s. The first public performance in Sweden of Miss Julie came in 1906. It was directed by August Falck, with whom Strindberg set up the experimental Intimate Theatre. He quickly created a repertoire of ‘chamber’ plays for the new theatre: The Storm, After the Fire, The Ghost Sonata and The Pelican. None met with much success, and when The Great Highway flopped badly, a row with Falck ended with the closure of the theatre in December 1910.

Strindberg died of stomach cancer in 1912. Earlier that year, his birthday had been marked by a torchlight procession through Stockholm – his radical journalism had earned him the title of ‘people’s writer’.





DRUNK ENOUGH TO SAY I LOVE YOU?





Drunk Enough to Say I Love You? was first performed at the Royal Court Theatre Downstairs, London, on 10 November 2006, with the following cast:



SAM

Ty Burrell



JACK

Stephen Dillane





Director

James Macdonald



Designer

Eugene Lee



Costume Designer

Joan Wadge



Lighting Designer

Peter Mumford



Sound Designer

Ian Dickinson



Composer

Matthew Herbert





The play received its American premiere at The Public Theater, New York, on 5 March 2008, directed by James Macdonald, and performed by Scott Cohen as Jack and Samuel West as Guy.

Note

Sam was always called Sam, because of Uncle Sam. I gave the other character the name Jack, thinking of it as just a name, but some people understandably thought it referred to Union Jack, and that Jack was Britain in the same way that Sam was America. But I always meant that character to be an individual, a man who falls in love with America, so I have changed his name to Guy.

Caryl Churchill





Characters

SAM, a country

GUY, a man

and two hundred and fifty million dollars to the Phillipines alone to train fifty thousand soldiers



GUY

plus military advisers



SAM

remember to use Green Berets of Puerto Rican and Mexican descent so it won’t look like a US army because



GUY

ha



SAM

would you believe six billion dollars in El Salvador? training thousands of



GUY

and the schools, I’m trying to organise



SAM

School of the Americas



GUY

coup school



SAM

Chemical School



GUY

enormous.



SAM

results in and we won in



GUY

yay



SAM

and we’ve got our man in Afghanistan



GUY

CIA guy?



SAM

Georgia check



GUY

Uzbekistan? because they boil



SAM

not so good in Bolivia



GUY

guy in the sweater?



SAM

and Saddam’s let us down, he’s no longer a good guy so



GUY

because sometimes propaganda isn’t enough to



SAM

military solution



GUY

so much fun in my life



SAM

being powerful and being on the side of good is



GUY

God must have so much fun



SAM

win win win



GUY

love you more than I can





3.

SAM

sitting around



GUY

not



SAM

so much to do because



GUY

thinking



SAM

no time for



GUY

all right I’m just



SAM

missing your



GUY

not at all



SAM

natural



GUY

get on with



SAM

because there’s all these people we have to



GUY

ok so here’s the bridge right here and the people there are people going across not soldiers just



SAM

North Korea



GUY

blow it up



SAM

there you go



GUY

don’t want you to worry because I don’t regret



SAM

death squads



GUY

right behind



SAM

in Guatemala, so we don’t directly ourselves appear to



GUY

corpses in the nets



SAM

decapitated, castrated, eyes gouged out, testicles



GUY

riddled with bullets and partially eaten by fish



SAM

slaughter the Indians to prevent



GUY

bulldoze the village



SAM

yes



GUY

and



SAM

not officially active in El Salvador



GUY

seventy-five thousand civilian



SAM

raping the



GUY

because if the young aren’t killed they just grow up to be



SAM

similarly Colombia where



GUY

Nicaragua



SAM

our freedom fighters the Contras are



GUY

Indonesia the embassy’s giving lists to their army which are a big help in who they should



SAM

mass slaying



GUY

there you are



SAM

and of course Israel where we don’t actually ourselves



GUY

extremely valuable experiment in the Philippines where



SAM

calling it search and destroy



GUY

experiments in pacification



SAM

terror against the Huks



GUY

and applying that now in Vietnam



SAM

Vietnam Vietnam now



GUY

go go go three million dead in Vietnam Laos Cambodia



SAM

two million tons of bombs on Laos now



GUY

more than on Germany and Japan in the whole



SAM

white phosphorous



GUY

statistics here on civilian injuries, lower extremities 60%, soft tissue 39%, fractures



SAM

not that interested



GUY

Iraq



SAM

not that interested in numbers of civilian



GUY

no



SAM

need to get on



GUY

I’m on it



SAM

Iraq



GUY

hundred and seventy-seven million pounds of



SAM

forty days



GUY

ten thousand sorties



SAM

very few casualties



GUY

oh ours, good



SAM

bombing them now as they retreat



GUY

ploughing wow ploughing live soldiers into the sand



SAM

done



GUY

and the children dead from sanctions we don’t count that because



SAM

again Iraq Iraq again



GUY

very few casualties



SAM

not publishing pictures



GUY

and certainly not of the civilians in Afghanistan there’s a paper in Florida making a mistake there getting a lot of emails and won’t do that again



SAM

bombing Vietnam now, bombing Grenada, bombing Korea, bombing Laos, bombing Guatemala, bombing Cuba, bombing El Salvador, bombing Iraq, bombing Somalia, bombing Lebanon



GUY

but it’s Israel bombing



SAM

so? bombing Bosnia, bombing Cambodia, bombing Libya, bombing



GUY

used to be a village and now



SAM

because we want it gone



GUY

need a coffee



SAM

get a coffee



GUY

exhausting



SAM

thrilling



GUY

exhausting being so thrilled



SAM

coffee but keep



GUY

bombing China, bombing Panama



SAM

good at this



GUY

well



SAM

did a whole lot before like second world war and going right back



GUY

all the back killings before like Indians



SAM

never sure how many we started



GUY

maybe twenty million, fifty



SAM

got them down to a quarter million so



GUY

not looking at that



SAM

no just get on with the job which is bombing



GUY

bombing Peru, bombing





4.

GUY

controlling



SAM

not



GUY

I feel



SAM

missing your family



GUY

only human, I’m naturally going to



SAM

just so I know where I am



GUY

expect me to just cut off everybody and not even speak



SAM

what you want



GUY

better if I do some



SAM

drawing up trade agreements



GUY

free trade



SAM

in a manner of



GUY

free



SAM

Structural Adjustment Programs



GUY

so that countries open up their markets to our



SAM

good ok like Haiti



GUY

surge in our rice exports to Haiti



SAM

ok



GUY

stopping the banana cartel



SAM

ok



GUY

and those beautiful African textiles made from our raw materials they agree to import rather than



SAM

or sometimes it’s the other way, it’s their raw materials like cocoa



GUY

and we make the chocolates you get on Valentine’s



SAM

because if they were allowed to make them



GUY

and the rice industry collapses in Haiti



SAM

because our economy is the priority here



GUY

costing poor countries two billion dollars a



SAM

really snitty mood today



GUY

just trying to understand exactly



SAM

essential because we consume more than half the goods in the world so you can’t



GUY

ok ok and privatisation a condition



SAM

because private means free



GUY

ok



SAM

problem with that?



GUY

just low today, I can’t quite



SAM

better get a grip



GUY

ok so it’s access for our goods



SAM

come on we’ve done debt cancellation here



GUY

yes I



SAM

and massive aid



GUY

linked to



SAM

what is the matter with you?



GUY

pointing out that it’s 80% our own companies that benefit from



SAM

generosity



GUY

point one percent of our



SAM

billions of dollars for christsake



GUY

just trying to see



SAM

yes and



GUY

Israel seems to get the largest share of



SAM

you want to go home?



GUY

didn’t say



SAM

because if you don’t want to be



GUY

I do



SAM

keep saying you love me and then we have all this



GUY

sorry



SAM

easy to



GUY

woke up feeling



SAM

maybe you should go back to bed and try again



GUY

no I’ll be



SAM

you better be



GUY

ok.



SAM

something to make you feel better



GUY

don’t really



SAM

good?



GUY

ah



SAM

french connection



GUY

mm?



SAM

golden triangle



GUY

sure



SAM

fighting Communists for us so we turn a blind eye



GUY

of course



SAM

heroin being flown in by Air America



GUY

excellent



SAM

flying down with the weapons and back with the drugs



GUY

shrimp company laundering the money so the CIA



SAM

22 tons of cocaine though he himself is head of the antidrug



GUY

but also we are against



SAM

totally



GUY

like in Peru



SAM

supporting the dictator because he’s fighting drugs



GUY

though I see here the CIA payroll



SAM

because the main priority is suppressing the guerrillas



GUY

like in Colombia



SAM

because FARC are definitely narcotraffickers



GUY

luckily



SAM

have to overlook the security services drug



GUY

and the equipment can also be used against trade unionists which saves



SAM

but in Afghanistan where of course the mujahadeen



GUY

beautiful fields of poppies



SAM

same trucks can deliver the arms and take the heroin back



GUY

so sometimes crack down and



SAM

massive trade figures



GUY

lot of people happy.



SAM

feeling better have a look at intellectual property rights



GUY

fascinating



SAM

forefront of science



GUY

traditional knowledge of primitive tribes which turns out to



SAM

neem



GUY

is what, neem?



SAM

in India



GUY

so we patent it do we and



SAM

ayehuasca, you ever heard ?



GUY

quinoa, kava, bitter gourd



SAM

so we’re manufacturing products out of



GUY

and selling them back to



SAM

yes



GUY

and most amazingly DNA



SAM

Amazonian Indian blood cells



GUY

the scale of it



SAM

per cent of human DNA has been acquired by



GUY

my god how



SAM

so you’re on that?



GUY

I’m on it.



SAM

because expenses are so huge like eight billion dollars we spend on cosmetics



GUY

hard to grasp such



SAM

ten on petfood



GUY

for comparison



SAM

six on



GUY

enough to provide health, food and education for the whole of the third



SAM

fuck is wrong with you?



GUY

trying to grasp the numbers that’s all, I



SAM

do things on a large scale



GUY

yes



SAM

way of life



GUY

yes



SAM

you chose



GUY

yes



SAM

can fuck off now if



GUY

no



SAM

yes fuck off now because



GUY

no please no



SAM

commitment





5.

SAM

space



GUY

god



SAM

all mine



GUY

so



SAM

deny others the use of space



GUY

it’s just



SAM

we have it, we like it and we’re going to keep it



GUY

fantastic



SAM

fight in space, we’re going to fight from space, we’re going to fight into



GUY

wow



SAM

you like it?



GUY

so big



SAM

star wars



GUY

and protect



SAM

protecting us with a shield



GUY

and nobody else can



SAM

precision strikes



GUY

though the UN



SAM

everyone else agrees a resolution not to use space so



GUY

giving us total



SAM

because with the proliferation of WMD



GUY

so many countries want



SAM

so we combat the threat by



GUY

I do worry about



SAM

because we have two and a half times the next nine countries put together



GUY

thank god



SAM

nuclear weapons stored in seven European



GUY

hey



SAM

chemical



GUY

whoo



SAM

go go go now dioxin



GUY

dioxin, god, three ounces in the water supply of New York would be enough to wipe out the whole



SAM

five hundred pounds dioxin now on Vietnam



GUY

yay



SAM

napalm



GUY

yay



SAM

sarin on Laos



GUY

yay



SAM

and biological too the most advanced



GUY

scientific



SAM

turkey feathers



GUY

feathers?



SAM

allegations by China that we



GUY

oh with germs on



SAM

decaying fish, anthrax



GUY

isn’t it turkey in Cuba?



SAM

turkey virus in Cuba



GUY

ok



SAM

contaminate the sugar



GUY

quite funny



SAM

but the serious science



GUY

the Chemical School in Alabama



SAM

teach our allies and share



GUY

Egypt’s using gas against the Yemen, and Saddam’s gassing the



SAM

exporting anthrax to Iraq, botulism, histoplasma capsulatum



GUY

e coli?



SAM

e coli, DNA



GUY

this stuff against Kurds or Iranians or?



SAM

keep selling it because



GUY

so great about chemical and biological they don’t destroy the buildings just kill the



SAM

ideal



GUY

and oh my god the conventional



SAM

cluster bombs



GUY

love the yellow



SAM

jagged steel shrapnel



GUY

soft targets



SAM

don’t always explode like one and a half million unexploded in the gulf



GUY

very high rate of



SAM

no, out of thirty



GUY

ok



SAM

but sometimes a quarter



GUY

orange groves, car parks



SAM

so don’t let Israel



GUY

ok



SAM

oh what the hell



GUY

ok



SAM

so you get these accidental



GUY

kids like the yellow



SAM

accidental loss of limbs



GUY

can’t be helped



SAM

and the depleted uranium so you get the lung and bone cancer and



GUY

don’t feel bad



SAM

babies, deformed



GUY

ugh



SAM

probably for other reasons



GUY

exactly



SAM

So, keeping ourselves safe



GUY

priority



SAM

bring freedom



GUY

love it when you say



SAM

most destructive power ever in the history of the



GUY

yes yes



SAM

and now space



GUY

stars



SAM

eternity filled with our



GUY

love you so



SAM

more and more





6.

SAM

faster



GUY

I’m



SAM

threat to our security



GUY

ok



SAM

if anyone harbours



GUY

I’m on it



SAM

retaliate against the facilities of the host country



GUY

yes



SAM

now



GUY

calm



SAM

got to plant bombs in the hotels in Havana



GUY

yes ok ok the Cuban exiles in Miami are just



SAM

and get the money to Iraq



GUY

done it, the Iraqi National Accord have the



SAM

and have they destabilised Saddam yet? no



GUY

car bombs



SAM

giving them millions



GUY

hundred civilians dead



SAM

not enough to



GUY

ok



SAM

fucking results



GUY

off my back will you?



SAM

desperate for



GUY

mujahadeen



SAM

yes yes train the



GUY

so ok that’s something really good



SAM

stop at nothing, flaying, explosions, whole villages



GUY

and here we’re getting on with assassinations



SAM

don’t allow



GUY

changing our



SAM

do allow



GUY

ok



SAM

so get on with



GUY

CIA’s Health Alteration Committee



SAM

great



GUY

planning



SAM

Castro, Allende, Ayatollah Khomeini



GUY

Lumumba, Osama, Charles de Gaulle



SAM

Michael Manley



GUY

Ngo Din Diem



SAM

but not all the bastards are dead so



GUY

disappeared, thousands and



SAM

all over the



GUY

impact



SAM

and what what fucking terror used against us



GUY

not my fault they



SAM

fucking Afghanis turned against us after all we



GUY

training camps and now



SAM

stop them



GUY

I’m



SAM

and Israel, innocent



GUY

body parts



SAM

vile



GUY

but the Israelis killing far more so



SAM

on top of this?



GUY

explosion at the embassy



SAM

fuck fuck do something



GUY

stop shouting at me because



SAM

on my side?



GUY

of course but



SAM

want to go home to your



GUY

maybe I do if you’re going to keep



SAM

fuck off then back



GUY

look out we’re being



SAM

no no no the towers



GUY

wow



SAM

evil



GUY

ok?



SAM

hate me because I’m so good



GUY

all these terrorists suddenly



SAM

makes everyone love me because it’s only the evildoers who hate me, you don’t hate me



GUY

no of course



SAM

you hate me



GUY

just sometimes wish you’d



SAM

what? what? you hate me



GUY

but maybe I can’t live with you any more





7.

SAM alone.





SAM

white double cable whip, iron wreath, beating the soles of the feet, put object in vagina, put object in anus, put turpentine on testicles, pour water over face, play very loud Indonesian music, electric shocks to genitals, tap a dowl through the ear into the brain, throw the prisoner out of the helicopter, show the prisoner another prisoner being thrown out of the helicopter, beating obviously, rape of course, bright light, no sleep, simulate an execution so they think up to the last second they’re going to die, play tape of women and children screaming in next room and tell prisoner it’s his wife and children, sometimes it is, hang up with hands tied behind back, pins in eyes, insecticide in hood over the head, cut off breasts, pull out heart, slit throat and pull tongue through, sulphuric acid, chop off





Enter GUY.



GUY

hello, I’ve



SAM

what you



GUY

but I missed you



SAM

same as before



GUY

try and



SAM

what you put me through



GUY

I’m sorry I



SAM

hurt me



GUY

yes I



SAM

take you back I need to know if



GUY

try to



SAM

total commitment or there’s no



GUY

I realise



SAM

capable



GUY

can



SAM

promise



GUY

love



SAM

nightmare here



GUY

yes



SAM

not going to be happy, hope you don’t



GUY

no I don’t expect



SAM

so what you



GUY

can’t live



SAM

no you can’t, can’t



GUY

no I can’t



SAM

ok then



GUY

doing?



SAM

need to teach



GUY

yes



SAM

special advisers



GUY

ok



SAM

Greece



GUY

the colonels’ Greece, we’re right behind



SAM

Operation Phoenix



GUY

Vietnam, operational



SAM

nobody questioned survives



GUY

forty-one thousand



SAM

teaching them in Brazil exactly how much electric shock you can administer without killing



GUY

because sometimes you may not want



SAM

sometimes it’s not politic



GUY

and sometimes it just doesn’t matter



SAM

El Salvador, Uraguay, Nicaragua, Guatemala,



GUY

delivering the manuals to Panama



SAM

and the thin wire can go in the diplomatic bag to Uraguay



GUY

thin wire?



SAM

against the gum and it increases the shock



GUY

need to be accurate



SAM

precise pain



GUY

for precise effect



SAM

so practice on beggars in a soundproof room



GUY

the US Office of Public Safety



SAM

fighting terror



GUY

put Mitrione in charge of



SAM

humanitarian



GUY

expert in administration of pain



SAM

always leave them some hope, he says



GUY

people who don’t need our encouragement because they already



SAM

Afghanistan



GUY

yes the game where the men are on horses and the prisoner



SAM

instead of a goat



GUY

one layer of skin at a time, which must take



SAM

so relatively speaking, Guantanamo



GUY

need results



SAM

need exemption from rules forbidding cruel, inhuman or degrading



GUY

because those rules



SAM

in the present climate



GUY

hoods over their heads or sexual



SAM

because their religion makes them upset by



GUY

menstrual blood



SAM

have to laugh



GUY

but some things we’d rather other people



SAM

747 rendering prisoners to



GUY

because there’s plenty of places where that can



SAM

can’t do everything ourselves



GUY

do our best



SAM

you’re doing great again



GUY

back with you



SAM

no fun though



GUY

sick today but



SAM

just stick with it and we’ll be





8.

GUY

icecaps



SAM

who fucking cares about



GUY

floods



SAM

because we’ll all be dead by the time it



GUY

another hurricane moving towards



SAM

natural



GUY

no but it’s greater than



SAM

natural disasters



GUY

not coping very



SAM

surprise



GUY

predicted and there is an element of manmade



SAM

stop fucking going on about



GUY

carbon



SAM

junk science.



GUY

report here from the



SAM

rewrites



GUY

‘serious threat to health’



SAM

delete



GUY

‘growing risk of adverse’



SAM

delete



GUY

‘uncertainties’



SAM

insert ‘significant and fundamental’



GUY

but



SAM

‘urgent action,’ delete



GUY

oil lobby?



SAM

Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow



GUY

ok



SAM

Advancement of Sound Science Coalition



GUY

a grassroots



SAM

set up by Exxon and Philip Morris to



GUY

ok



SAM

and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has many beneficial effects on



GUY

hot in here?



SAM

always finding something wrong with



GUY

and you never?



SAM

let’s just



GUY

ok



SAM

what? what? you smoking? you gave up, you



GUY

don’t care because



SAM

kill yourself



GUY

fucking planet



SAM

kill me, kill me, secondhand



GUY

junk science



SAM

put it out



GUY

no



SAM

put it out



GUY

what difference



SAM

thank you



GUY

carbon



SAM

can’t see it in the air, so



GUY

Kyoto?



SAM

price of electricity in California



GUY

but



SAM

nuclear



GUY

waste



SAM

solution



GUY

Iran?



SAM

Technology Institute will come up with new



GUY

by when will they



SAM

if you’re so smart



GUY

different



SAM

freedom to



GUY

if



SAM

lose everything we’ve



GUY

hard to



SAM

things I need



GUY

look out



SAM

what?



GUY

don’t know, I thought



SAM

deep breaths and



GUY

don’t want to stop flying



SAM

trade in carbon so we can still



GUY

we’ll last longer than



SAM

don’t let them in



GUY

no water



SAM

be ok



GUY

catastrophe



SAM

so fucking negative



GUY

frightened



SAM

leave me if you don’t



GUY

done that



SAM

stay then and be some



GUY

hopeless



SAM
