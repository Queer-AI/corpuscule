LEVINE
Look! A note!
TAMMY
Let me read it!
MOM
No, we’ll each read it to ourselves.
LEVINE
No, I’ll read it out loud and we’ll play fill in the blank. Whoever gets the most words right gets the blue blanket tonight.
MOM
There’s a blue blanket up above.
TAMMY
Spare me! She’s had the blue blanket for a week now. LEVINE
MOM AND TAMMY
Girls!
LEVINE
Wrong. “Dear lovelies.” Both of you get minus one. TAMMY
MOM
Lovelies. She’s buttering us up.
LEVINE
“. .. I miss you. I never wrote so many BLANKS before.” TAMMY
MOM
EPISTLES!
TAMMY
Checks!
LEVINE
Letters is right. Miss Blue Blanket is back to zero! And I continue
MOM
MONEY AND I’M GETTING OUT!
TAMMY
Bed!
LEVINE
Oh no, I’m sorry, you’re both wrong. Mom is minus one, Tammy is a whopping minus five.
TAMMY
I am not minus five. I only guessed once last time.
LEVINE
Yeah, but you had minus four before that . . .
TAMMY
Don’t you get a positive number when you add two negative numbers?
TAMMY
( screaming) Pissed off!
MOM
Patient.
LEVINE
(quickly) I’m sorry. Both of you are wrong. The word is angry.
TAMMY
(loud, excited) What’s the difference between pissed off and angry?
LEVINE
You’ve got a point there. You’re back to minus four. I continue . . . “There’s a woman up here who I’ve come to like very much. She and I BLANK deeply for one another.
MOM AND TAMMY
CARE!!!
LEVINE
Right, Mom’s back to zero, Tammy’s at minus three. “We have together come to realize the money, the commercials and car mean less to us than BLANK ...”
TAMMY
SEX!
MOM
Show business!
LEVINE
Sorry, you’re both wrong, the answer is love. Mom, you’re minus one. Tammy you’re minus four once again, dear. I continue - “This woman has put me in touch with a strong desire. I have to settle down and it just so happens she has just bought herself a new co-op apartment with a doorman, a washer-dryer, a sunroof and BLANKETY BLANK BLANK.” Now this one’s a multiple word phrase. You get partial credit for partial right answers.
TAMMY
You mean partial penalty for partially wrong answers.
MOM
Don’t be so negative.
TAMMY
Well it seems that all we get is minus this and minus that. MOM
LEVINE
Do I have any submissions?
TAMMY
Read it again?
LEVINE
Okay, listen carefully. This is worth ten points. The entire game may hinge on it. “This woman has put me in touch with a strong desire. I have to settle down and it just so happens that she
LEVINE
No, you’re thinking of multiplication.
TAMMY
They’re all the same anyway. Keep reading. Wait. What’s the blank in there?
LEVINE
Mind, Tammy. “I’ve made up my mind and I’m cornin’
TAMMY
A formica dinette suite.
MOM
A color TV!
LEVINE
Mom is right!! A Betamax video cassette recorder with full four color and time memory! I continue
MOM
Competitors!
TAMMY
I don’t want to play anymore.
LEVINE
No, I’m sorry. A minus one gives you a plus six. The answer is friends. “I know you, my closest friends, have stood by me since day one of this marathon, and have made it possible for me to learn as much as I have and to come for the first time into a full understanding of my own moral BLANK!”
MOM
Decrepitude!
TAMMY
Filth!
LEVINE
I’m sorry, both of you are wrong. The answer is values. Pause.
TAMMY
( sad) So she’s cornin’ down and we don’t win a mobile home.
MOM
( matter-of-fact) No.
TAMMY
We don’t win nothin’.
MOM
No.
TAMMY
We wasted all this time for nothin’.
LEVINE
No, it was not for nothing, Tammy, we just have one less iron in the fire, that’s all. It’s not a tragedy. Now gather round please. Get your costumes, your props. We have a show in twenty minutes, hon’.
TAMMY
(choking back tears) You mean we’re gonna go ahead and do the show just like nothin’ happened?
LEVINE
(softly) Yes . . . yes. (She coaxes Tammy to hang the curtain , which she does)
TAMMY
It’s not fair. It’s just not fair. We have nothin’. We have absolutely nothin’. It’s like havin’ a job and not gettin’ your pay.
MOM
We got our pay. The sense to do what we want in the first place instead of waiting around for a bonus prize at the end of a stupid game show. And Lost Petal is out of the range from Concorde planes.
TAMMY
( crying ) Oh, 1 hate Lost Petal! (She goes behind the curtain. Mom and Tammy change into highly colorful and theatrical gowns from different periods. LeVine is still in her long red gown. The following scene is done from behind the curtain)
LEVINE
Why do you call her Lost Petal, Mom? She always gets exactly what she wants.
MOM
Because she pays her soul for it.
LEVINE
Oh, really. What’s your soul worth if it’s always too high a price to pay for anything, Mom?
TAMMY
I could have been a soul singer if I didn’t get messed up waitin’ for everybody else to keep their promises.
MOM
LeVine, wash the peanut butter off your skirt before the show.
TAMMY
So what are we goin’ to do now, LeVine? You’re the big producer. Just what in the hell are we gonna do now?
LEVINE
( moving from cool to upset) First thing I’m gonna do is perform The Shanghai Gesturel Then I’m gonna wash my hair. Then I’m going down to the city desk and get our story in the human interest section. Then I’m gonna come back and I’m gonna do my laundry, then I’m gonna sit by the phone and wait for it to ring with an offer.
MOM
First you wash your dirty laundry in public, then you wash it in private. Relax, LeVine, you run around too much.
LEVINE
( coming from behind the curtain) Okay, I think this is it. Tammy, get out in front of the curtain. Stand by everybody. Places please! Tammy we’re gonna go on a count of five. All right, stand by. Five-four-three-two-one and action.
NARRATOR
She knows the secrets of all China. She knows also the tongue is an ax for the neck. But never in her life has she parted with her secrets for the joy of telling. That’s why she is necessary for the government. That is why the police use her, protect her and dread her. That is Mother Godam.
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
Mother Godam!
MOTHER GODAM
I am honored to welcome Sir Guy Chartoris to my house. (She bows , removing the lid from the sewing box as if tipping a hat)
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
It is a far greater honor for Sir Guy Chartoris at last to be welcome by Mother . . . Mother . . .
MOTHER GODAM
GODAM . . . you have not heard the name? Are you afraid to say it?
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
Hitherto we . . .
MOTHER GODAM
Hitherto we smiled with half our faces . . .
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
And now??
MOTHER GODAM
And now you kiss my hand.
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
Now I kiss your hand. What charming little hands you have.
MOTHER GODAM
You think SO?
SIR GUY CHART ORIS
Yes. Your face is an enigma. What are you thinking, Mother Godam?
MOTHER GODAM
I am thinking that our meeting is like the rush of two big storms . . . one from the East . . . one from the West . . . racing up from the inferno to a meeting. Heh heh heh. You know ... I think we are going to like each other . . . very much. Heh heh heh HAYNH!
MOTHER GODAM
Ooo dee pah tree, the greeting of the New Year to all of you, and welcome to my home. You know this is the Chinese New Year, this is the day in China to pay all debts, big, little, great or small, you pay yours, I pay mine. Mine to you, Sir Guy, yours to me.
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
Mine to you??? Surely there’s no outstanding debt between us, is there?
MOTHER GODAM
No.
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
If there should be, tell me.
MOTHER GODAM
Oh, it is only a figure of my speech. For many years I have owed a debt, tonight I will pay it. That is all, heh heh heh.
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
The very look, the very laugh you had last night at the opera.
MOTHER GODAM
Ah yes, the Madame Butterfly, poor papillon, a man forsakes her and she kills herself. How stupid. How could I have forgotten? She was Japanese.
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
What is the Chinese woman’s way?
MOTHER GODAM
Ah she would wait I think for many years. Everything would go . . . and a lingering death ... a slicing-off process. A little bit cut off each day and the raw edge left to be sliced again the next day. But these things alone would die . . . the woman ... no ... what is your opinion, Sir Guy Chartoris?
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
I am not an authority on Chinese women.
MOTHER GODAM
No? And yet you have lived in China so many years.
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
Nearly thirty.
MOTHER GODAM
In spite of the many years you have lived here you still know nothing of Chinese ways. Chinese women. You will learn. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. (Tammy gongs) Tonight my comic spirit runs fast along and now for your entertainment my piece de resistance. Now I will show you China and the Chinese woman. Bring in the junkmen.
TAMMY
BRING IN THE JUNKMEN! (She gongs)
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
A naked girl on a tray! What does this mean?
MOTHER GODAM
It means tonight I hold an auction sale. Tonight I sell this girl as a flesh junk to those many junkmen yonder; they have come to bid for her.
SIR GUY CHARTORIS
The girl is white, how dare you? We’ll have the law in there in half a moment if you don’t stop.
MOTHER GODAM
Heh heh heh HAYNH! The law! I am the law! Here I am the government. I am the police. Here. Heh. You have all been asked here for a purpose and here you will stay. Until I am through with you. Now you junkmen, how much will you bid for this girl?
NARRATOR
Before the horrified guests Mother Godam auctions off the girl Lost Petal to the highest bidder among the frantic junkmen. Finally the girl is taken away and the noise subsides. The guests sit frozen in their seats as Mother Godam says
MOTHER GODAM
I’M GONNA BE A WHEEL ONE DAY. (She sings this song or one similar with the help of LeVine and Tammy , pretending she’s James Brown , throwing her cape around her. The song finishes and Mother Godam says , exhausted
TAMMY
I want to go to New Orleans.
LEVINE
We can’t do Medea in New Orleans.
MOM
We can do Medea anywhere we please. We can do it in Shanghai if we please.
TAMMY
You mean in the middle of the play all of a sudden we do Medea ?
LEVINE
Interesting montage concept, Ma. TAMMY
TAMMY
Oh Mother, could we go to New Orleans, please?
MOM
Ask LeVine. She keeps the time.
LEVINE
Mom, does the van still work?
MOM
We’ll have to remind it of its purpose. It’s been thinking it’s Bleecker Court Co-op Apartments.
TAMMY
Wouldn’t it be nice for a while, please LeVine.
LEVINE
Yes, it would be quite nice to go to New Orleans.
MOM
Let’s pack up.
TAMMY
Can I help you? (An imaginary customer refers to the suit coat that LeVine has thrown off during her song) Yeah. Well sure, she doesn’t care much about that one. Hold on just a second, she was only modeling it, really. It was here on this table just a second ago. She put it on cause she took a little chill. Looks like rain soon. She’s got plenty of her own. Hold on . . . LeVine, that lady wants to buy your suit. She’s loaded . . . she’ll give us twenty dollars. Even fifty I bet. I’ll tell her it’s an antique.
LEVINE
( offended at the request) She wants to buy my clothes, my only clothes?
TAMMY
Yeah, c’mon LeVine. Money for travellin’.
LEVINE
What’ll I wear to work?
TAMMY
Oh screw, LeVine, nobody can see your clothes on the phone.
MOM
(giving her ring to Tammy) Throw this in as a bonus, tell her for an extra five the junkmen will love it.
LEVINE
You’re a real Mother of Pearls, Mom.
MOM
I am a mother, a good mother. That’s all.
TAMMY
She’s thinking it over.
MOM
(to LeVine) You know that part where she’s telling off that Guy Charter-Bus?
LEVINE
Chartoris, Mom.
MOM
. . . and she talks about hate helping her survive . . . that’s a monologue worthy of Medea.
MOTHER GOD AM
Into the nasty entrails of the China Sea he sold me. On a junk with giggling hopeless girls I went fastened under
TAMMY
Ouu! Medea in New Orleans, we’ll have people standin’ at the end - standin’ and clappin’ like a standin’ ovation.
MOTHER GODAM
Hate helped me and I survived.
LEVINE
I’ll write an article.
MOTHER GODAM
Rickshaw men of Nagasaki I survived.
LEVINE
I’ll send it to John Perrone in New Orleans at the Ledger. We’ll get some advance publicity for this thing.
MOTHER GODAM
Coolies from Papua.
TAMMY
(to a new customer) Can I help you?
MOTHER GODAM
Nugget men from New South Wales.
TAMMY
Why yes it’s for sale.
MOTHER GODAM
I survived.
TAMMY
Oh sure, we just replaced the fan pump and put in a new water belt. All new and fit as a fiddle.
MOTHER GODAM
Red hot sulphur burned into my naked back to make my tired body gay.
TAMMY
You hold on a minute.
MOTHER GODAM
I survived.
LEVINE
Mom keep your throat open, hon’. Let the bitterness flow right out.
MOTHER GODAM
The soles of my feet slit open and pebbles sewn inside to keep me from running away.
TAMMY
LeVine!
LEVINE
(reading from a clipboard) Tammy, how does this sound
TAMMY
Some man out there wants to buy our van.
LEVINE
How much is he offering?
MOM
Tell him no! We’re going to New Orleans. I did not die, no, I lived.
LEVINE
(to Tammy) We’re going to New Orleans.
TAMMY
We’re going to New Orleans!
MOTHER GODAM
And here I am after twenty years, after twenty years am I my dear to pay this debt to you.
TAMMY
(to the customer) I’m sorry but we changed our minds.
MOTHER GODAM
But we will let that pass for the moment I wish you all adieu you can go wherever you like there will be no more dinner. I very wisely did not order anything beyond the fish, I was quite certain there would be no further appetite. So I have saved myself entree roast and sweets . . . HEH HEH clever these Chinese. Adieu bon nuit, bonsoir, bonsoir . . . bon nuit . . . bon nuit . . . (The medley of music returns. The lights fade out.)
