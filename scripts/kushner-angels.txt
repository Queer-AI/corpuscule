Well, it's old. Very old. Which in some circles equals
EMILY
Not in my circle. What's the name of the tapestry?
LOUIS
The Bayeux tapestry. Embroidered by La Reine
EMILY
I'll tell my mother. She embroiders. Drives me nuts.
LOUIS
Manual therapy for anxious hands.
EMILY
Maybe you should try it.
LOUIS
Mathilde stitched while William the Conqueror was

At least.
LOUIS
I'm going.
EMILY
It's one AM. Where do you have to go at. . .
LOUIS
I know what time it is. A walk. Night air, good for
EMILY
Be careful.
LOUIS
Yeah. Danger.
JOE
The pills were something she started when she miscarried
ROY
Strict.
JOE
I shouldn't be bothering you with this.
ROY
NO, please. Heart to heart. Want another. . . . What is
JOE
The failure to measure up hits people very hard. From such a strong desire to be good they feel very far from goodness
ROY
Why would you need it?
JOE
There are things. ... I don't know how well we know
ROY
Pass?
JOE
Yeah.
ROY
Pass as what?
JOE
Oh. Well. ... As someone cheerful and strong. Those
ROY
But you had secrets? Secret struggles . . .
JOE
I wanted to be one of the elect, one of the Blessed. You feel you ought to be, that the blemishes are yours by choice,
ROY
YOU didn't put it there.
JOE
NO.
ROY
YOU sound like you think you did.
JOE
I am responsible for her.
ROY
Because she's your wife.
JOE
That. And I do love her.
ROY
Whatever. She's your wife. And so there are obligations.
JOE
She'd fall apart in Washington.
ROY
Then let her stay here.
JOE
She'll fall apart if I leave her.
ROY
Then bring her to Washington.
JOE
I just can't, Roy. She needs me.
ROY
Listen, Joe. I'm the best divorce lawyer in the business.
JOE
Can't Washington wait?
ROY
YOU do what you need to do, Joe. What you need. You. Let her life go where it wants to go. You'll both be better for
MAN
What do you want?
LOUIS
I want you to fuck me, hurt me, make me bleed.
MAN
I want to.
LOUIS 
Yeah?
MAN
I want to hurt you.
LOUIS
Fuck me.
MAN
Yeah?
LOUIS
Hard.
MAN
Yeah? You been a bad boy?
LOUIS
Very bad. Very bad.
MAN
You need to be punished, boy?
LOUIS
Yes. I do.
MAN
Yes what?
LOUIS
Um, I . . .
MAN
Yes what, boy?
LOUIS
Oh. Yes sir.
MAN
I want you to take me to your place, boy.
LOUIS
NO, I can't do that.
MAN
NO what}
LOUIS
NO sir, I can't, I . . .
MAN
Your lover know you're out with a man tonight, boy?
LOUIS
No sir, he . . .
MAN
Your lover know you . . .
LOUIS
Let's change the subject, OK? Can we go to your place?
MAN
I live with my parents.
LOUIS
Oh.
ROY
Everyone who makes it in this world makes it because
JOE
I had a hard time with my father.
ROY
Well sometimes that's the way. Then you have to find
JOE
Um, dead.
ROY
He was . . . what? A difficult man?
JOE
He was in the military. He could be very unfair. And cold.
ROY
But he loved you.
JOE
I don't know.
ROY
NO, no, Joe, he did, I know this. Sometimes a father's love has to be very, very hard, unfair even, cold to make his son
MAN
Here, then.
LOUIS
I. . . . Do you have a rubber?
MAN
I don't use rubbers.
LOUIS
You should. (He takes one from his coat pocket) Here.
MAN
I don't use them.
LOUIS
Forget it, then. (He starts to leave)
MAN
NO, wait.
LOUIS
Forget it, I have to get back. Home. I must be going
MAN
Oh come on please he won't find out.
LOUIS
It's cold. Too cold.
MAN
It's never too cold, let me warm you up. Please?
MAN
Relax.
LOUIS 
Not a chance.
MAN
It . . .
LOUIS
What?
MAN
I think it broke. The rubber. You want me to keep going?
LOUIS
Keep going.
MAN
I . . . um, look, I'm sorry, but I think I want to go.
LOUIS
Yeah.
LOUIS
OW!
LOUIS
It was a joke.
ROY
How long have we known each other?
JOE
Since 1980.
ROY
Right. A long time. I feel close to you, Joe. Do I advise
JOE
You've been an incredible friend, Roy, I . . .
ROY
I want to be family. Familia, as my Italian friends call
JOE
I owe practically everything to you, Roy.

Oh my God.

Please. Let me finish.

You better tell the doctor. Or I will.

NO no don't. Please. I want the voice; it's wonderful. It's all that's keeping me alive. I don't want to talk to some

Yes, Roy?
ROY
Rub my back.
MARTIN
Roy . . .
ROY
NO no really, a sore spot, I get them all the time now,
ROY 
How do you think a handful of Bolsheviks turned St. Petersburg into Leningrad in one afternoon? Comrades. Who do for each other. Marx and Engels. Lenin
ROY
Comrades, right Martin?
MARTIN
This man, Joe, is a Saint of the Right.
JOE
I know, Mr. Heller, I . . .
ROY
And you see what I mean, Martin? He's special, right?
MARTIN
Don't embarrass him, Roy.
ROY
Gravity, decency, smarts! His strength is as the strength

We're on the move, Joe. On the move.
JOE
Mr. Heller, I . . .
MARTIN 
We can't wait any longer for an answer.
JOE
Oh. Um, I . . .

Joe's a married man, Martin.

Aha.

With a wife. She doesn't care to go to D.C., and so Joe

Oh yes. Beware.

I really can't discuss this under . . .

Then don't discuss. Say yes, Joe.

Say yes I will.

JOE
Roy. This is . . . Roy, this is terrible.

You're telling me.

Why, Martin?

Revenge.

Roy, that's. . . . You borrowed money from a client?
ROY
I'm deeply ashamed.
JOE 
Roy, you know how much I admire you.
ROY
Not so damp, please. I'll deny it was a loan. She's got no paperwork. Can't prove a fucking thing.

Roy I really appreciate your telling me this, and I'll do whatever I can

I'll tell you what you can do.

YOU do.

You're not asking me to . . .
ROY
Sssshhhh. Careful.

Even if I said yes to the job, it would be illegal to interfere. With the hearings. It's unethical. No.
ROY
Un-ethical.

Excuse you?

Take a walk, Martin. For real.
ROY
Un-ethical. Are you trying to embarrass me in front of my

Well it is unethical, I can't . . .

No, but Roy this is . . .

This is. . . this is gastric juices churning, this is enzymes and acids, this is intestinal is what this is, bowel movement and blood-red meat—this stinks, this is politics,

Why can't Mr. Heller . . .
ROY
Grow up, Joe. The administration can't get involved.
JOE
But I'd be part of the administration. The same as him.
ROY
Not the same. Martin's Ed's man. And Ed's Reagan's man.
ROY
Ah, Martin's back.
MARTIN
SO are we agreed?

Huh.

Your friend.

He won't. Neither will Reagan.

You're eating one.

You can't believe everything you . . .

But . . . I think we all know what that's like. Nowadays. No connections. No responsibilities. All of us . . . falling through the cracks that sep-

Oh you're not heartless.

You don't know.

Then don't.

I can't go in, I need . . .

Central Park.

CENTRAL PARK! Oh my Lord. What on earth

Harper and Joe at home; Louis and Prior in Priors hospital room. Joe and Louis have just entered. This should be fast and obviously furious; overlapping is fine; the proceedings may be a little confusing but not the final results.
HARPER
Oh God. Home. The moment of truth has arrived.
JOE
Harper.
LOUIS
I'm going to move out.
PRIOR
The fuck you are.
JOE
Harper. Please listen. I still love you very much. You're still my best buddy; I'm not going to leave you.

No pills. Bad for the . . . (Pats stomach)

You aren't pregnant. I called your gynecologist.
HARPER
I'm seeing a new gynecologist.

YOU have no right to do this.

Oh, that's ridiculous.

No right. It's criminal.

Forget about that. Just listen. You want the truth. This is the truth.

Criminal.

There is a law. You'll see.

I need some privacy.

That's new.
LOUIS
Everything's new, Prior.

I try to tighten my heart into a knot, a snarl, I try to learn to live dead, just numb, but then I see someone I want, and
PRIOR
Apartment too small for three? Louis and Prior comfy
LOUIS
Something like that.
PRIOR
Bang bang bang. The court will come to order.
LOUIS
I mean let's talk practicalities, schedules; I'll come over if you want, spend nights with you when I can, I can . . .
PRIOR
Has the jury reached a verdict?
LOUIS
I'm doing the best I can.
PRIOR
Pathetic. Who cares?
JOE
My whole life has conspired to bring me to this place, and I can't despise my whole life. I think I believed when I met
HARPER
I think you should go.
JOE
Where?
HARPER
Washington. Doesn't matter.
JOE
What are you talking about?
HARPER
Without me.
JOE
Yes.
LOUIS
YOU can love someone and fail them. You can love

I have to find some way to save myself.

Who are these men? I never understood it. Now I know.

It's me.
HARPER
It is?
PRIOR
GET OUT OF MY ROOM!
JOE
I'm the man with the knives.
HARPER
YOU are?

If I could get up now I'd kill you. I would. Go away. Go away or I'll scream.

Oh God . . .

It is you.

Please don't scream.
