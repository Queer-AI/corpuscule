THE BISHOP 
In truth, the mark of a prelate is not mildness or unction, but the most rigorous intelligence. Our heart is our undoing. We think we are master of our kindness; we are the slaves of a serene laxity. It is something quite other than intelligence that is involved. . . . (He hesitates.) It may be cruelty. And beyond that cruelty—and through it—a skilful, vigorous course towards Absence. Towards Death. God? (Smiling)I can read your mind! (To his mitre)Mitre, bishop's bonnet, when my eyes close for the last time, it is you that I shall see behind my eyelids, you, my beautiful gilded hat . . . you, my handsome ornaments, copes, laces. . . .
IRMA 
An agreement's an agreement. When a deal's been made. . . .
THE BISHOP 
And when the die is cast. . . .
IRMA 
No. Twenty. Twenty and no nonsense. Or I'll lose my temper. And that's not like me. . . . Now, if you have any difficulties. . . .
THE BISHOP 
Thank you.
IRMA 
And don't break anything. We need that. (To the woman) Put it away.
THE BISHOP 
I've been told that this house is going to be besieged. The rebels have already crossed the river.
IRMA 
There's blood everywhere. . . . You can slip round behind the Archbishop's Palace. Then, down Fishmarket Street. . . .
IRMA 
But I told them to be quiet. Good thing I remembered to cover the windows with padded curtains.
THE BISHOP 
Let's not talk about that now. It's over. I'm concerned only about getting home. . . . You say the city's splashed with blood. . . .
THE WOMAN 
There was a blessing, Madame. Then, my confession. . . .
IRMA 
And after that?
THE BISHOP 
That'll do!
THE WOMAN 
That was all. At the end, my absolution.
IRMA 
Won't anyone be able to witness it? Just once?
THE BISHOP 
No, no. Those things must remain secret, and they shall. It's indecent enough to talk about them while I'm being undressed. Nobody. And all the doors must be closed. Firmly closed, shut, buttoned, laced, hooked, sewn. . . .
IRMA 
I merely asked. . . .
THE BISHOP 
Sewn, Madame.
IRMA 
You'll allow me at least, won't you, to feel a little uneasy . . . professionally? I said twenty.
THE BISHOP 
We didn't tire ourselves. Barely six sins, and far from my favourite ones.
THE WOMAN 
Six, but deadly ones! And it was a job finding those.
THE BISHOP 
What? You mean they were false?
THE WOMAN 
They were real, all right! I mean it was a job committing them. If only you realized what it takes, what a person has to go through, in order to reach the point of disobedience.
THE BISHOP 
I can imagine, my child. The order of the world is so lax that you can do as you please there—or almost. But if your sins were false, you may say so now.
IRMA 
Oh no! I can hear you complaining already the next time you come. No. They were real. (To the woman) Untie his laces. Take off his shoes. And when you dress him, be careful he doesn't catch cold. (To the Bishop) Would you like a toddy, a hot drink?
THE BISHOP 
Thank you. I haven't time. I must be going. (Dreamily)
IRMA 
Come here, we'll undress you!
THE BISHOP 
No, no, not yet.
IRMA 
It's time. Come on! Quick! Make it snappy!
THE BISHOP 
About the sins, you really did commit them?
THE WOMAN 
I did.
THE BISHOP 
You really made the gestures? All the gestures?
THE WOMAN
I did.
THE BISHOP 
When you moved towards me with your face forward, was it really aglow with the light of the flames?
THE WOMAN 
It was.
THE BISHOP 
And when my ringed hand came down on your forehead, forgiving it. . . .
THE WOMAN 
It was.
THE BISHOP 
And when my gaze pierced your lovely eyes?
THE WOMAN 
It was.
IRMA 
Was there at least a glimmer of repentance in her lovely eyes, my Lord?
THE BISHOP 
A fleeting glimmer. But was I seeking repentance in them? I saw there the greedy longing for transgression. In flooding it, evil all at once baptized it. Her big eyes opened on the abyss . . . a deathly pallor lit up—yes, Madame—lit up her face. But our holiness lies only in our being able to forgive you your sins. Even if they're only make-believe.
THE WOMAN 
And what if my sins were real?
THE BISHOP 
You're mad! I hope you really didn't do all that!
IRMA 
Don't listen to her. As for her sins, don't worry. Here there's no. . . .
THE BISHOP 
I'm quite aware of that. Here there's no possibility of doing evil. You live in evil. In the absence of remorse. How could you do evil? The Devil makes believe. That's how one recognizes him. He's the great Actor. And that's why the Church has anathematized actors.
THE WOMAN 
Reality frightens you, doesn't it?
THE BISHOP 
If your sins were real, they would be crimes, and I'd be in a fine mess.
THE WOMAN 
Would you go to the police?
IRMA 
Stop plaguing her with all those questions.
THE BISHOP 
That wasn't a make-believe scream.
IRMA 
I don't know. . . . Who knows and what does it matter?
THE BISHOP 
Now answer, mirror, answer me. Do I come here to discover evil and innocence? (To Irma, very gently) Leave the room! I want to be by myself.
IRMA 
It's late. And the later it gets, the more dangerous it'll be . . .
THE BISHOP 
Just one more minute.
IRMA 
You've been here two hours and twenty minutes. In other words, twenty minutes too long. . . .
THE BISHOP 
I want to be by myself.
THE BISHOP 
Now answer, mirror, answer me. Do I come here to discover evil and innocence? And in your gilt-edged glass, what was I? Never—I affirm it before God Who sees me—I never desired the episcopal throne. To become bishop, to work my way up—by means of virtues or vices—would have been to turn away from the ultimate dignity of bishop. I shall explain
IRMA 
Have you finished?
THE BISHOP 
For Christ's sake, leave me alone. Get the hell out! I'm probing myself.
THE BISHOP 
The majesty, the dignity, that light up my person, do not emanate from the attributions of my function.—No more, good heavens! than from my personal merits.—The majesty, the dignity that light me up come from a more mysterious brilliance
IRMA 
That'll do now. You've got to leave.
THE BISHOP 
You're crazy! I haven't finished.
IRMA 
I'm not trying to pick an argument, and you know it, but you've no time to waste. . . .
THE BISHOP 
What you mean is that you need the room for someone else and you've got to arrange the mirrors and jugs.
IRMA 
That's no business of yours. I've given you every attention while you've been here. And I repeat that it's dangerous for anyone to loiter in the streets.
THE BISHOP 
That's not true. You don't give a damn about my safety. When the job's finished, you don't give a damn about anyone!
IRMA 
Stop listening to him and undress him.
IRMA 
Lend a hand. You're stiff.
THE BISHOP 
Stiff? I'm stiff? A solemn stiffness! Final immobility. . . .
IRMA 
Hand him his jacket. . . .
THE BISHOP 
Ornaments, laces, through you I re-enter myself. I reconquer a domain. I beleaguer a very ancient place from which I was driven. I install myself in a clearing where suicide at last becomes possible. The judgment depends on me, and here I stand, face to face with my death.
IRMA 
That's all very fine, but you've got to go. You left your car at the front door, near the power-station.
THE BISHOP 
Because our Chief of Police, that wretched incompetent, is letting us be slaughtered by the rabble! (Turning to the mirror and declaiming) Ornaments! Mitres! Laces! You, above all, oh gilded cope, you protect me from the world. Where are my legs, where are my arms? Under your scalloped, lustrous flaps, what have my hands been doing? Fit only for fluttering gestures, they've become mere stumps of wings—not of angels, but of partridges!—rigid cope, you make it possible for the most tender and luminous sweetness to ripen in warmth and darkness. My charity, a charity that will flood the world—it was under this carapace that I distilled it. . . . Would my hand emerge at times, knife-like, to bless? Or cut, mow down? My hand, the head of a turtle, would push aside the flaps. A turtle or a cautious snake? And go back into the rock. Underneath, my hand would dream. . . . Ornaments, gilded copes. . . .
THE THIEF 
Not yet! Lick it! Lick it first. . . .
THE JUDGE 
For you're a thief! You were caught. . . . Who? The police. . . . Have you forgotten that your movements are hedged about by a strong and subtle network, my strong-arm cops? They're watchful, swivel-eyed insects that lie in wait for you. All of you! And they bring you captive, all of you, to the Bench. . . . What have you to say for yourself? You were caught. . . . Under your skirt. . . . (To the Executioner.) Put your hand under her skirt. You'll find the pocket, the notorious Kangaroo Pocket. . . . (To the Thief) that you fill with any old junk you pick up. Because you're an idiot to boot. . . . (To the Executioner.) What was there in that notorious Kangaroo Pocket? In that enormous paunch?
THE EXECUTIONER 
Bottles of scent, my Lord, a flashlight, a bottle of Fly-tox, some oranges, several pairs of socks, bearskins, a Turkish towel, a scarf. (To the Judge.) Do you hear me? I said
THE JUDGE 
A scarf? Ah ha, so that's it? Why the scarf? Eh? What were you going to do with it? Whom were you planning to strangle? Answer. Who? . . . Are you a thief or a strangler? (Very gently, imploringly) Tell me, my child, I beg of you, tell me you're a thief.
THE THIEF 
Yes, my Lord.
THE EXECUTIONER 
No!
THE THIEF 
No?
THE EXECUTIONER 
That's for later.
THE THIEF 
Eh?
THE EXECUTIONER 
I mean the confession is supposed to come later. Plead not guilty.
THE THIEF 
What, and get beaten again!
THE JUDGE 
Exactly, my child
THE THIEF 
I've already cried. . . .
THE JUDGE 
Under the blows. I want tears of repentance. When I see you wet as a meadow I'll be utterly satisfied!
THE THIEF 
It's not easy. I tried to cry before. . . .
THE JUDGE 
You're quite young. Are you new here? (Anxiously) At least you're not a minor?
THE THIEF 
Oh no, sir.
THE JUDGE 
Call me my Lord. How long have you been here?
THE EXECUTIONER 
Since the day before yesterday, my Lord.
THE JUDGE 
Let her speak. I like that puling voice of hers, that voice without resonance. . . . Look here
THE THIEF 
Oh yes, my Lord.
THE JUDGE 
Good. Thus far everything has gone off well. My executioner has hit hard . . . for he too has his function. We are bound together, you, he and I. For example, if he didn't hit, how could I stop him from hitting? Therefore, he must strike so that I can intervene and demonstrate my authority. And you must deny your guilt so that he can beat you.
THE EXECUTIONER 
No, no, you needn't worry. I bolted the door.
THE JUDGE 
Are you sure?
THE EXECUTIONER 
You can take my word for it.
THE JUDGE 
The smell of tobacco inspires me.
THE EXECUTIONER 
Nothing at all. Someone must have dropped something. You're getting nervous.
THE JUDGE 
That may be, but my nervousness makes me aware of things. It keeps me on the alert.
THE EXECUTIONER 
Just a quick one, because it's getting late.
THE JUDGE 
It's lit up. Brightly lit, but empty.
THE EXECUTIONER 
Empty!
THE JUDGE 
You seem anxious. Has anything new happened?
THE EXECUTIONER 
This afternoon, just before you arrived, the rebels took three key-positions. They set fire to several places. Not a single fireman came out. Everything went up in flames. The Palace. . . .
THE JUDGE 
What about the Chief of Police? Twiddling his thumbs as usual?
THE THIEF 
There's been no news of him for four hours. If he can get away, he's sure to come here. He's expected at any moment.
THE JUDGE 
In any case, he'd better not plan to come by way of Queen's Bridge. It was blown up last night.
THE THIEF 
We know that. We heard the explosion from here.
THE JUDGE 
All right. Let's get on with it. Thus, taking advantage of the sleep of the just, taking advantage of a moment's inattention, you rob them, you ransack, you pilfer and purloin. . . .
THE THIEF 
No, my Lord, never. . . .
THE EXECUTIONER 
Shall I tan her hide?
THE THIEF 
Arthur!
THE EXECUTIONER 
What's eating you? Don't address me. Answer his Lordship. And call me Mr. Executioner.
THE THIEF 
Yes, Mr. Executioner.
THE JUDGE 
I continue
THE THIEF 
I did, I did, my Lord.
THE JUDGE 
Good. Now answer quickly, and to the point
THE THIEF 
Bread, because I was hungry.
THE JUDGE 
Sublime! Sublime function! I'll have all that to judge. Oh, child, you reconcile me with the world. A judge! I'm going to be judge of your acts! On me depends the weighing, the balance. The world is an apple. I cut it in two
THE THIEF 
You frighten me, sir.
THE JUDGE 
Be still. In the depths of Hell I sort out the humans who venture there. Some to the flames, the others to the boredom of the fields of asphodel. You, thief, spy, she-dog, Minos is speaking to you, Minos weighs you. (To the Executioner) Cerberus?
THE EXECUTIONER 
Bow-wow, bow-wow!
THE JUDGE 
You're handsome! And the sight of a fresh victim makes you even handsomer. (He curls up the Executioner's lips.) Show your fangs. Dreadful. White. (Suddenly he seems anxious. To the Thief) But at least you're not lying about those thefts—you did commit them, didn't you?
THE EXECUTIONER 
Don't worry. She committed them, all right. She wouldn't have dared not to. I'd have made her.
THE JUDGE 
I'm almost happy. Continue. What did you steal?
THE JUDGE 
There's simply no end to it. Not a moment's rest.
THE THIEF 
I told you
THE EXECUTIONER 
Shut up!
THE JUDGE 
Are you going to answer, yes or no? What else have you stolen? Where? When? How? How much? Why? For whom?
THE THIEF 
I very often entered houses when the maids were off. I used the tradesmen's entrance. . . . I stole from drawers, I broke into children's piggy-banks. (She is visibly trying to find words.)
THE JUDGE 
Where? Where? Where? Where—where— where? Where did you go in?
THE THIEF 
I can't remember. Forgive me.
THE EXECUTIONER 
Shall I let her have it?
THE JUDGE 
Not yet. (To the girl) Where did you go in? Tell me where?
THE THIEF 
But I swear to you, I don't remember.
THE EXECUTIONER 
Shall I let her have it? Shall I, my Lord?
THE JUDGE 
Ah! ah! your pleasure depends on me. You like to thrash, eh? I'm pleased with you, Executioner! Masterly mountain of meat, hunk of beef that's set in motion at a word from me! (He pretends to look at himself in the Executioner.) Mirror that glorifies me! Image that I can touch, I love you. Never would I have the strength or skill to leave streaks of fire on her back. Besides, what could I do with such strength and skill? (He touches him.) Are you there? You're all there, my huge arm, too heavy for me, too big, too fat for my shoulder, walking at my side all by itself! Arm, hundredweight of meat, without you I'd be nothing. . . . (To the Thief) And without you too, my child. You're my two perfect complements. . . . Ah, what a fine trio we make! (To the Thief) But you, you have a privilege that he hasn't, nor I either, that of priority. My being a judge is an emanation of your being a thief. You need only refuse— but you'd better not!—need only refuse to be who you are—what you are, therefore who you are—for me to cease to be . . . to vanish, evaporated. Burst. Volatilized. Denied. Hence
THE THIEF 
I might.
THE JUDGE 
What's that? What's that you say? You'd refuse? Tell me where. And tell me again what you've stolen.
THE THIEF 
I won't.
THE JUDGE 
Tell me where. Don't be cruel. . . .
THE THIEF 
Your tone is getting too familiar. I won't have it!
THE JUDGE 
Miss. . . . Madame. I beg of you. (He falls to his knees.) Look, I beseech you. Don't leave me in this position, waiting to be a judge. If there were no judge, what would become of us, but what if there were no thieves?
THE THIEF 
And what if there weren't?
THE JUDGE 
It would be awful. But you won't do that to me, will you? Please understand me
THE EXECUTIONER 
Crawl.
THE JUDGE 
I'm proud!
THE EXECUTIONER 
Crawl!
THE EXECUTIONER 
Good. Continue.
THE JUDGE 
You're quite right, you rascal, to make me crawl after my judgeship, but if you were to refuse for good, you hussy, it would be criminal. . . .
THE THIEF 
Call me Madame, and ask politely.
THE JUDGE 
Will I get what I want?
THE THIEF 
It costs a lot—stealing does.
THE JUDGE 
I'll pay! I'll pay whatever I have to, Madame. But if I no longer had to divide the Good from the Evil, of what use would I be? I ask you?
THE THIEF 
I ask myself.
THE JUDGE 
A while ago I was going to be Minos. My Cerberus was barking. (To the Executioner) Do you remember? (THE EXECUTIONER interrupts the Judge by cracking his whip.) You were so cruel, so mean! So good! And me, I was pitiless. I was going to fill Hell with the souls of the damned, to fill prisons. Prisons! Prisons! Prisons, dungeons, blessed places where evil is impossible since they are the crossroads of all the malediction in the world. One cannot commit evil in evil. Now, what I desire above all is not to condemn, but to judge. . . . (He tries to get up.)
THE EXECUTIONER 
Crawl! And hurry up, I've got to go and get dressed.
THE JUDGE 
Madame! Madame, please, I beg of you. I'm willing to lick your shoes, but tell me you're a thief. . . .
THE THIEF 
Not yet! Lick! Lick! Lick first!
T
the GENERAL. He removes his jacket, then his bowler hat and his gloves. IRMA is near him.
THE GENERAL 
Have that cleared out.
IRMA 
It'll be folded and wrapped.
THE GENERAL 
Have it removed from sight.
IRMA 
It'll be put away. Even burned.
THE GENERAL 
Yes, yes, of course, I'd like it to burn! Like cities at twilight.
IRMA 
Did you notice anything on the way?
THE GENERAL 
I ran very serious risks. The populace has blown up dams. Whole areas are flooded. The arsenal in particular. So that all the powder supplies are wet. And the weapons rusty. I had to make some rather wide detours—though I didn't trip over a single drowned body.
IRMA 
I wouldn't take the liberty of asking you your opinions. Everyone is free, and I'm not concerned with politics.
THE GENERAL 
Then let's talk of something else. The important thing is how I'm going to get out of this place. It'll be late by the time I leave. . . .
IRMA 
About it's being late. . . .
THE GENERAL 
That does it.
THE GENERAL 
I'm not keen about being shot down in the dark when I leave. For, of course, there won't be anyone to escort me?
IRMA 
I'm afraid not. Unfortunately Arthur's not free. (A long pause.)
THE GENERAL 
But . . . isn't she coming?
IRMA 
I can't imagine what she's doing. I gave instructions that everything was to be ready by the time you arrived. The horse is already here. . . . I'll ring.
THE GENERAL 
Don't, I'll attend to that. (He rings.) I like to ring! Ringing's authoritative. Ah, to ring out commands.
IRMA 
In a little while, General. Oh, I'm so sorry, here am I giving you your rank. . . . In a little while you'll. . . .
THE GENERAL 
Sh! Don't say it.
IRMA 
YOU have such force, such youth! such dash!
THE GENERAL 
And spurs. Will I have spurs? I said they were to be fixed to my boots. Oxblood boots, right?
IRMA 
Yes, General. And patent-leather.
THE GENERAL 
Oxblood. Patent-leather, very well, but with mud?
IRMA 
With mud and perhaps a little blood. I've had the decorations prepared.
THE GENERAL 
Authentic ones?
IRMA 
Authentic ones. (Suddenly a woman's long scream.)
THE GENERAL 
What's that?
IRMA 
Nothing. There's always some carelessness, on both sides.
THE GENERAL 
But that cry? A woman's cry. A call for help perhaps? My heart skips a beat. . . . I spring forward. . . .
IRMA 
I want no trouble here. Calm down. For the time being, you're in mufti.
THE GENERAL 
That's right.
THE GENERAL 
All the same, it's disturbing. Besides, it'll be awkward.
IRMA 
What on earth can she be doing?
THE GENERAL 
So you finally got here? Half an hour late. That's more than's needed to lose a battle.
IRMA 
She'll redeem herself, General, I know her.
THE GENERAL 
What about the blood? I don't see any blood.
IRMA 
It dried. Don't forget that it's the blood of your past battles. Well, then, I'll leave you. Do you have everything you need?
THE GENERAL 
You're forgetting. . . .
IRMA 
Good God! Yes. I was forgetting.
THE EXECUTIONER 
Is Mme Irma here?
THE GIRL 
In the Rose-garden. (Correcting herself) I'm sorry, in the Funeral Chapel.
THE GENERAL 
I'll be left in peace, I hope. And you're late. Where the hell were you? Didn't they give you your feed-bag? You're smiling, are you? Smiling at your rider? You recognize his hand, gentle but firm? (He strokes her.) My proud steed! My handsome mare, we've had many a spirited gallop together!
THE GIRL 
And that's not all! I want to trip through the world with my nervous legs and well-shod hooves. Take off your trousers and shoes so I can dress you.
THE GENERAL 
All right, but first, down on your knees! Come on, come on, bend your knees, bend them. . . .
THE GENERAL 
Bravo! Bravo, Dove! You haven't forgotten a thing. And now, you're going to help me and answer my questions. It's fitting and proper for a nice filly to help her master unbutton himself and take off his gloves, and to be at his beck and call. Now start by untying my laces. (During the entire scene that follows, THE GIRL helps THE GENERAL remove his clothes and then dress up as a general. When he is completely dressed, he will be seen to have taken on gigantic proportions, by means of trick effects
THE GIRL 
Left foot still swollen?
THE GENERAL 
Yes. It's my leading-foot. The one that prances. Like your hoof when you toss your head.
THE GIRL 
What am I doing? Unbutton yourself.
THE GENERAL 
Are you a horse or an illiterate? If you're a horse, you toss your head. Help me. Pull. Don't pull so hard. See here, you're not a plough-horse.
THE GIRL 
I do what I have to do.
THE GENERAL 
Are you rebelling? Already? Wait till I'm ready. When I put the bit into your mouth. . . .
THE GIRL 
Oh no, not that.
THE GENERAL 
A general reprimanded by his horse! You'll have the bit, the bridle, the harness, the saddlegirth, and I, in boots and helmet, will whip and plunge!
THE GIRL 
The bit is awful. It makes the gums and the corners of the lips bleed. I'll drool blood.
THE GENERAL
Foam pink and spit fire! But what a gallop! Along the rye-fields, through the alfalfa, over the meadows and dusty roads, over hill and dale, awake or asleep, from dawn to twilight and from twilight. . . .
THE GIRL 
Tuck in your shirt. Pull up your braces. It's quite a job dressing a victorious general who's to be buried. Do you want the sabre?
THE GENERAL 
Let it lie on the table, like Lafayette's. Conspicuously, but hide the clothes. Where? How should I know? Surely there's a hiding-place somewhere.
THE GENERAL 
The tunic? Good. Got all the medals? Count ‘em.
THE GIRL 
They're all here, sir.
THE GENERAL 
What about the war? Where's the war?
THE GIRL 
It's approaching, sir. It's evening in an apple-orchard. The sky is calm and pink. The earth is bathed in a sudden peace—the moan of doves—the peace that precedes battles. The air is very still. An apple has fallen to the grass. A yellow apple. Things are holding their breath. War is declared. The evening is very mild. . . .
THE GENERAL 
But suddenly?
THE GIRL 
We're at the edge of the meadow. I keep myself from flinging out, from whinnying. Your thighs are warm and you're pressing my flanks. Death. . . .
THE GENERAL 
But suddenly?
THE GIRL 
Death has pricked up her ears. She puts a finger to her lips, asking for silence. Things are lit up with an ultimate goodness. You yourself no longer heed my presence. . . .
THE GENERAL 
But suddenly?
THE GIRL 
Button up by yourself, sir. The water lay motionless in the pools. The wind itself was awaiting an order to unfurl the flags. . . .
THE GENERAL 
But suddenly?
THE GIRL 
Suddenly? Eh? Suddenly? (She seems to be trying to find the right words.) Ah yes, suddenly all was fire and sword! Widows! Miles of crêpe had to be woven to put on the standards. The mothers and wives remained dry-eyed behind their veils. The bells came clattering down the bombed towers. As I rounded a corner I was frightened by a blue cloth. I reared, but, steadied by your gentle and masterful hand, I ceased to quiver. I started forward again. How I loved you, my hero!
THE GENERAL 
But. . . the dead? Weren't there any dead?
THE GIRL 
The soldiers died kissing the standard. You were all victory and kindness. One evening, remember. . . .
THE GENERAL 
I was so mild that I began to snow. To snow on my men, to shroud them in the softest of winding-sheets. To snow. Moskova!
THE GIRL 
Splinters of shell had gashed the lemons. Now death was in action. She moved nimbly from one to the other, deepening a wound, dimming an eye, tearing off an arm, opening an artery, discolouring a face, cutting short a cry, a song. Death was ready to drop. Finally, exhausted, herself dead with fatigue, she grew drowsy and rested lightly on your shoulder, where she fell asleep.
THE GENERAL 
Stop, stop, it's not time for that yet, but I feel it'll be magnificent. The cross-belt? Good. (He looks at himself in the mirror.) Austerlitz! General! Man of war and in full regalia, behold me in my pure appearance. Nothing, no contingent trails behind me. I appear, purely and simply. If I went through wars without dying, went through sufferings without dying, if I was promoted, without dying, it was for this minute close to death.
THE GIRL 
What is it, sir?
THE GENERAL 
What's the Chief of Police been doing?
THE GIRL 
Not at all. And, in any case, it's no business of ours. Continue. You were saying
THE GENERAL 
. . . close to death . . . where I shall be nothing, though reflected ad infinitum in these mirrors, nothing but my image. . . . Quite right, comb your mane. Curry yourself. I require a well-groomed filly. So, in a little while, to the blare of trumpets, we shall descend—I on your back—to death and glory, for I am about to die. It is indeed a descent to the grave. . . .
THE GIRL 
But, sir, you've been dead since yesterday.
THE GENERAL 
I know . . . but a formal and picturesque descent, by unexpected stairways. . . .
THE GIRL 
You are a dead general, but an eloquent one.
THE GENERAL 
Because I'm dead, prating horse. What is now speaking, and so beautifully, is Example. I am now only the image of my former self. Your turn, now. Lower your head and hide your eyes, for I want to be a general in solitude. Not even for myself, but for my image, and my image for its image, and so on. In short, we'll be among equals.
THE GIRL 
The procession has begun. . . . We're passing through the City. . . . We're going along the river. I'm sad. . . . The sky is overcast. The nation weeps for that splendid hero who died in battle. . . .
THE GENERAL 
Dove!
THE GIRL 
Sir?
THE GENERAL 
Add that I died with my boots on!
THE GIRL
My hero died with his boots on! The procession continues. Your aides-de-camp precede me. . . . Then come I, Dove, your war-horse. . . . The military band plays a funeral march. . . .
T
"Yes.”
THE MAN 
What about the lice?
THE GIRL 
They're there.
IRMA
CARMEN. Machine-gun fire.
CARMEN 
The bishop, twenty . . . the judge, twenty . . . . (She raises her head.) No, Madame, nothing yet. No Chief of Police.
IRMA 
He's going to turn up, if he turns up . . . fit to be tied! And yet!
CARMEN 
Yes, I know
IRMA 
I've told you, Carmen, I don't like that. And I demand respect for the visitors. Vi-si-tors! I don't allow myself— my own self (she stresses the word “own")—even to refer to them as clients. And yet! . . . (She flashily snaps the sheaf of fresh banknotes that she has in her hand.)
CARMEN 
For you, yes
IRMA 
Those eyes! Don't be unjust. You've been irritable for some time now. I realize we're on edge because of what's going on, but things will quiet down. The sun will come out again. George. . . .
CARMEN 
Ah, him!
IRMA 
Don't sneer at the Chief of Police. If not for him we'd be in a fine mess. Yes, we, because you're tied up with me. And with him. (A long pause.) What disturbs me most is your sadness. (Wisely.) You've changed, Carmen. And even before the rebellion started. . . .
CARMEN 
There's nothing much left for me to do at your place, Mme. Irma.
IRMA 
But . . . I've put you in charge of my bookkeeping. You sit down at my desk and all at once my entire life opens out before you. I haven't a secret left, and you're not happy?
CARMEN 
Of course, I'm grateful to you for your confidence, but . . . it's not the same thing.
IRMA 
Do you miss “that”, Carmen? (CARMEN is silent.) Come, come, Carmen, when you mounted the snow-covered rock with the yellow paper rose-bush—by the way, I'm going to have to store that in the cellar—and when the miraculously-healed leper swooned at the sight of you, you didn't take yourself seriously, did you, Carmen? (Brief silence.)
CARMEN 
When our sessions are over, Madame, you never allow anyone to talk about them. So you have no idea of how we really feel. You observe it all from a distance. But if ever you once put on the dress and the blue veil, or if you were the unbuttoned penitent, or the general's mare, or the country girl tumbled in the hay. . . .
IRMA 
Me!
CARMEN 
Or the maid in a pink apron, or the archduchess deflowered by the policeman, or . . . but I'm not going to run through the whole list . . . you'd know what that does to a girl's soul, and that she's got to use a little irony in self-defence. But no, you don't even want us to talk about it among ourselves. You're afraid of a smile, of a joke.
IRMA 
True, I don't allow any joking. A giggle, or even a smile, spoils everything. A smile means doubt. The clients want sober ceremonies. With sighs. My house is a severe place. You're allowed to play cards.
CARMEN 
Then don't be surprised that we're sad. (A pause.) But I'm thinking of my daughter.
IRMA 
Every time I ask you a slightly intimate question, you shut up like a clam, and you throw your daughter up to me. Are you still set on going to see her? Don't be a fool. Between this place and the nursery in the country there's fire and water, rebellion and bullets. I even wonder whether . . . (The bell buzzes again. MME IRMA pulls up the switch and pushes down another) . . . whether they didn't get George on the way. Though a Chief of Police knows how to take care of himself. (She looks at a watch that she takes from her bosom.) He's late. (She looks anxious.) Or else he hasn't dared to go out.
CARMEN 
In order to get to your studios, those gentlemen of yours go through gunfire without fear, whereas I, in order to see my daughter. . . .
IRMA 
Without fear? In a state of jitters that excites them. Their nostrils can sniff the orgy behind the wall of flame and steel. . . . Let's get back to the accounts, shall we?
CARMEN 
In all, counting the sailor and the simple jobs, it comes to three hundred and twenty.
IRMA 
The more killing there is in the working-class districts, the more the men roll into my studios.
CARMEN 
The men?
IRMA 
Some men. Drawn by my mirrors and chandeliers, always the same ones. As for the others, heroism takes the place of women.
CARMEN 
Women?
IRMA 
What shall I call you, my big, long, sterile girls? Their seed never ripens in you, and yet . . . if you weren't there?
CARMEN 
You have your revels, Mme Irma.
IRMA 
Be still. It's this chilling game that makes me sad and melancholy. Fortunately I have my jewels. Which, as it happens, are in great danger. (Dreamily) I have my jewels . . . and you, the orgies of your heart. . . .
CARMEN 
. . . they don't help matters, Madame. My daughter loves me.
IRMA 
You're the fairy godmother who comes to see her with toys and perfumes. She pictures you in Heaven. (Bursting out laughing) Ah, that's the limit—to think there's someone for whom my brothel—which is Hell—is Heaven! It's Heaven for your brat! (She laughs.) Are you going to make a whore of her later on?
CARMEN 
Mme Irma!
IRMA 
That's right! I ought to leave you to your secret brothel, your precious pink cat-house, your soulful whore-house. . . . You think I'm cruel? This rebellion is getting me down, too. You may not realize it, but I have moments of fear and panic. . . . It looks to me as if the aim of the rebellion weren't to capture the Royal Palace, but to sack my studios. I'm afraid, Carmen. Yet I've tried everything, even prayer. (She smiles painfully.) Like your miraculously-healed leper. Have I wounded you?
CARMEN 
Twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, I had to be the Immaculate Conception of Lourdes and appear to a bank-clerk of the National Provincial. For you it meant money in the bank and justified your brothel, whereas for me it was. . . .
IRMA 
You agreed to it. You didn't seem to mind it.
CARMEN 
I was happy.
IRMA 
Well? Where's the harm?
CARMEN 
I saw the effect I had on my bank-clerk. I saw his state of terror, how he'd break out in a sweat, I heard the rattle in his throat. . . .
IRMA 
That'll do. He doesn't come any more. I wonder why? Maybe the danger. Or maybe his wife found out. (A pause.) Maybe he's dead. Attend to my accounts.
CARMEN 
Your book-keeping will never replace my appearing to the bank-clerk. It had become as real as at Lourdes. Everything inside me now yearns for my daughter. She's in a real garden. . . .
IRMA 
You'll have a hard time getting to her, and before long the garden will be in your heart.
CARMEN 
Be still!
IRMA 
The city is full of corpses. All the roads are cut off. The peasants are also going over to the rebels. I wonder why? Contagion? The rebellion is an epidemic. It has the same fatal and sacred character. In any case, we're going to find ourselves more and more isolated. The rebels have it in for the Clergy, for the Army, for the Magistracy, for me, Irma, a bawd and madame of a whore-house. As for you, you'll be killed, disembowelled, and your daughter will be adopted by some virtuous rebel. And that's what's in store for all of us. (She shudders.)
IRMA 
Studio 24, Chamber of the Sands. What's going on? (She watches very attentively. A long pause.)
CARMEN 
The Foreign Legion?
IRMA 
Yes. It's the heroic Legionnaire falling to the sand. And that idiot Rachel has thrown a dart at his ear. He might have been disfigured. What an idea, having himself shot as if by an Arab, and dying—if you want to call it that!—at attention, on a sandpile! (A silence. She watches attentively.) Ah, Rachel's doctoring him. She's preparing a dressing for him, and he has a happy look. (Very much interested.) My, my, he seems to like it. I have a feeling he wants to alter his scenario and that starting today he's going to die in the military hospital, tucked in by his nurse. . . . Another uniform to buy. Always expenses. (Suddenly anxious.) Say, I don't like that. Not one bit. I'm getting more and more worried about Rachel. She'd better not double-cross me the way Chantal did. (Turning around, to Carmen.) By the way, no news of Chantal?
CARMEN 
None.
IRMA 
And the machine's not working right! What's he saying to her? He's explaining . . . she's listening . . . she understands. I'm afraid he understands too. (Buzzing again. She pushes down another switch and looks.) False alarm. It's the plumber leaving.
CARMEN 
Which one?
IRMA 
The real one.
CARMEN 
Which is the real one?
IRMA 
The one who repairs the taps.
CARMEN 
Is the other one fake?
IRMA 
Ah, I told you so
CARMEN 
He's married, isn't he?
IRMA 
As a rule, I don't like to talk about the private life of my visitors. The Grand Balcony has a world-wide reputation. It's the most artful, yet the most decent house of illusions. . . .
CARMEN 
Decent?
IRMA 
Discreet. But I might as well be frank with you, you inquisitive girl. Most of them are married.
CARMEN 
When they're with their wives, whom they love, do they keep a tiny, small-scale version of their revels in a brothel. . . .
IRMA 
Carmen!
CARMEN 
Excuse me, Madame . . . in a house of illusions. I was saying
IRMA 
It's possible, child. No doubt they do. Like a Chinese lantern left over from a carnival, and waiting for the next one, or, if you prefer, like an imperceptible light in the imperceptible window of an imperceptible castle that they can enlarge instantly whenever they feel like going there to relax. (Machine-gun fire.) You hear that? They're approaching. They're out to get me.
CARMEN 
All the same, it must be nice in a real house.
IRMA 
They'll succeed in surrounding the house before George arrives. . . . One thing we mustn't forget—if ever we get out of this mess—is that the walls aren't sufficiently padded and the windows aren't well sealed. . . . One can hear all that's going on in the street. Which means that from the street one can hear what's going on in the house.
CARMEN 
In a real house, it must be nice. . . .
IRMA 
Who knows! But Carmen, if my girls start bothering their heads about such things, it'll be the ruin of the brothel. I really think you miss your apparition. Look, I can do something for you. I did promise it to Regina, but I offer it to you. If you want to, of course. Someone rang me up yesterday and asked for a Saint Theresa. . . . (A pause.) Ah, obviously, it's a come-down from the Immaculate Conception to Saint Theresa, but it's not bad either. . . . (A pause.) Well, what do you say? It's for a banker. Very clean, you know. Not demanding. I offer it to you. If the rebels are crushed, naturally.
CARMEN 
I liked my dress and veil and rose-bush.
IRMA 
There's a rose-bush in the “Saint Theresa” too. Think it over.
CARMEN 
And what'll the authentic detail be?
IRMA 
The ring. He's got it all worked out. The wedding ring. You know that every nun wears a wedding ring, as a bride of God. (CARMEN makes a gesture of astonishment.) That's so. That's how he'll know he's dealing with a real nun.
CARMEN 
What about the fake detail?
IRMA 
It's almost always the same
CARMEN 
It's really very kind of you, to think of him.
IRMA 
I'm thinking of you.
CARMEN 
You're so kind, Madame—I wasn't being ironic. The thing to be said for your house is that it brings consolation. You set up and prepare their secret theatres. . . . You've got your feet on the ground. The proof is that you rake in the money. Whereas they . . . their awakening must be brutal. No sooner is it finished than it starts all over again.
IRMA 
Luckily for me.
CARMEN 
. . . starts all over again, and always the same adventure. They'd like it never to end.
IRMA 
You miss the entire point. When it's over, their minds are clear. I can tell from their eyes. Suddenly they understand mathematics. They love their children and their country. Like you.
CARMEN 
I'm the daughter of a high-ranking officer. . . .
IRMA 
I know. There always has to be one in a brothel. But bear in mind that General, Bishop and Judge are, in real life. . . .
CARMEN 
Which are you talking about?
IRMA 
Real ones.
CARMEN 
Which are real? The ones here?
IRMA 
The others. In real life they're props of a display that they have to drag in the mud of the real and commonplace. Here, Comedy and Appearance remain pure, and the Revels intact.
CARMEN 
The revels that I indulge in. . . .
IRMA 
I know what they are
CARMEN 
Do you blame me for that?
IRMA 
And theirs are to forget yours. They, too, love their children. Afterwards.
CARMEN 
The Chief of Police?
IRMA 
No. The waiter who just arrived. He's going to start complaining again . . . there he goes, he's flaring up because Elyane is handing him a white apron.
CARMEN 
I warned you. He wants a pink one.
IRMA
Go to the Five-and-Ten tomorrow, if it's open. And buy a duster for the railwayman. A green one.
CARMEN 
If only Elyane doesn't forget to drop the tip on the floor. He demands a true revolt. And dirty glasses.
IRMA 
They all want everything to be as true as possible. . . . Minus something indefinable, so that it won't be true. (Changing her tone.) Carmen, it was I who decided to call my establishment a house of illusions, but I'm only the manager. Each individual, when he rings the bell and enters, brings his own scenario, perfectly thought out. My job is merely to rent the hall and furnish the props, actors and actresses. My dear, I've succeeded in lifting it from the ground—do you see what I mean? I unloosed it long ago and it's flying. I cut the moorings. It's flying. Or, if you like, it's sailing in the sky, and I with it. Well, my darling . . . may I say something tender—every madame always, traditionally, has a slight partiality for one of her young ladies. . . .
CARMEN 
I had noticed it, Madame, and I too, at times. . . . (She looks at Irma languidly,)
IRMA 
I have a strange feeling, Carmen. (A long pause.) But let's continue. Darling, the house really does take off, leaves the earth, sails in the sky when, in the secrecy of my heart, I call myself, but with great precision, a keeper of a bawdy-house. Darling, when secretly, in silence, I repeat to myself silently, “You're a bawd, boss of a whore-house,” darling, everything (suddenly lyrical), everything flies off—chandeliers, mirrors, carpets, pianos, caryatids and my studios, my famous studios
CARMEN 
How well you speak.
IRMA 
I went through elementary school.
CARMEN 
So I assumed. My father, the artillery colonel. . . .
IRMA 
You mean cavalry, my dear.
CARMEN 
Excuse me. That's right. The cavalry colonel wanted me to have an education. Alas. . . . As for you, you've been successful. You've been able to surround your loveliness with a sumptuous theatre, a gala, the splendours of which envelop you and hide you from the world. Your whoredom required such pomp. But what about me, am I to have only myself and be only myself? No, Madame. Thanks to vice and men's heartache, I too have had my moment of glory! With the receiver at your ear, you could see me through the view-finder, standing erect, sovereign and kind, maternal yet feminine, with my heel on the cardboard snake and the pink paper-roses. You could also see the bank-clerk from the National City kneeling before me and swooning when I appeared to him. Unfortunately he had his back to you and so you weren't aware of the ecstasy on his face and the wild pounding of my heart. My blue veil, my blue robe, my blue apron, my blue eyes. . . .
IRMA 
They're hazel.
CARMEN 
They were blue that day. For him I was Heaven in person descending on his brow. I was a Madonna to whom a Spaniard might have prayed and sworn an oath. He hymned me, fusing me with his beloved colour, and when he carried me to bed, it was into the blue that he penetrated. But I won't ever appear to him again.
IRMA 
I've offered you Saint Theresa.
CARMEN 
I'm not prepared, Mme Irma. One has to know what the client's going to require. Has everything been worked out?
IRMA 
Every whore should be able—I hope you'll excuse me, but since we've gone so far, let's talk man to man—should be able to handle any situation.
CARMEN 
I'm one of your whores, Mme Irma, and one of your best. I boast of it. In the course of an evening, I can . . .
IRMA 
I'm aware of your feats. But when you start glorifying yourself as soon as you hear the word whore, which you keep repeating to yourself and which you flaunt as if it were a title, it's not quite the same as when I use the word to designate a function. But you're right, darling, to extol your profession and to glory in it. Make it shine. Let it illuminate you, if that's the only thing you have.
CARMEN 
The Army is fighting bravely.
IRMA 
And the Rebels even more bravely. And we're in the shadow of the cathedral, a few feet from the Archbishop's Palace. There's no price on my head. No, that would be too much to expect, but it's known that I serve supper to prominent people. So they're out to get me. And there are no men in the house.
CARMEN 
There's Arthur.
IRMA 
Are you trying to be funny? He's no man, he's my stage-prop. Besides, as soon as his session is over, I'll send him to look for George.
CARMEN 
Assuming the worst. . . .
IRMA 
If the rebels win? I'm a goner. They're workers. Without imagination. Prudish and maybe chaste.
CARMEN 
It won't take them long to get used to debauchery. Just wait till they get a little bored. . . .
IRMA 
You're wrong. Or else they won't let themselves get bored. But I'm the one who's most exposed. For you it's different. In every revolution there's the glorified whore who sings an anthem and is virginified. That'll be you. The others'll piously bring water for the dying to drink. Afterwards . . . they'll marry you off. Would you like to get married?
CARMEN 
Orange blossoms, tulle . . .
IRMA 
Wonderful! To you, getting married means masquerading. Darling, you certainly are one of us. No, I can't imagine you married either. Besides, what they're really dreaming of doing is murdering us. We'll have a lovely death, Carmen. It will be terrible and sumptuous. They may break into my studios, shatter the crystals, tear the brocades and slit our throats. . . .
CARMEN 
They'll take pity. . . .
IRMA 
They won't. They'll thrill at the thought that their fury is sacrilegious. All bedraggled, with caps on their heads, or in helmets and boots, they'll destroy us by fire and sword. It'll be very beautiful. We oughtn't to wish for any other kind of end, and you, you're thinking of leaving. . . .
CARMEN 
But Mme Irma. . . .
IRMA 
Yes, yes. When the house is about to go up in flames, when the rose is about to be stabbed, all you think of, Carmen, is fleeing.
CARMEN 
If I wanted to be elsewhere, you know very well why.
IRMA 
Your daughter is dead. . . .
CARMEN 
Madame!
IRMA 
Whether dead or alive, your daughter is dead. Think of the charming grave, adorned with daisies and artificial wreaths, at the far end of the garden . . . and that garden in your heart, where you'll be able to look after it. . . .
CARMEN 
I'd have loved to see her again. . . .
IRMA 
You'll keep her image in the image of the garden and the garden in your heart under the flaming robe of Saint Theresa. And you hesitate? I offer you the very finest of deaths, and you hesitate? Are you a coward?
CARMEN 
You know very well I'm devoted to you.
IRMA 
I'll teach you figures! The wonderful figures that we'll spend the nights together calligraphing.
CARMEN 
The war is raging. As you said, it's the horde.
IRMA 
The horde, but we have our cohorts, our armies, our hosts, legions, battalions, vessels, heralds, clarions, trumpets, our colours, streamers, standards, banners. . . to lead us to catastrophe! Death? It's certain death, but with what speed and with what dash! . . . (Melancholically)
C
it's too candid and straightforward. (She turns to CARMEN.) There you have the dangers of regularity. It would be a catastrophe if my clients and girls smiled at each other affectionately. It would be an even greater catastrophe than if it were a question of love. (She presses the switch mechanically and lays down the receiver. Pensively
CARMEN 
What are you wearing?
IRMA 
The cream-coloured négligé.
CARMEN 
Madame?
IRMA 
Yes. About Chantal, tell me, what do you know about her?
CARMEN 
I've questioned all the girls
IRMA 
But, tell me, you wouldn't have any scruples about it?
CARMEN 
None at all. Entering a brothel means rejecting the world. Here I am and here I stay. Your mirrors and orders and the passions are my reality. What jewels are you wearing?
IRMA 
The diamonds. My jewels. They're the only things I have that are real. I feel everything else is sham. I have my jewels as others have little girls in gardens. Who's double-crossing? You're hesitating.
CARMEN 
The girls all mistrust me. I collect their little report. I pass it on to you. You pass it on to the police. The police check on it. . . . Me, I know nothing.
IRMA 
You're cautious. Give me a handkerchief.
CARMEN 
Viewed from here, where, in any case, men show their naked selves, life seems to me so remote, so profound, that it has all the unreality of a film or of the birth of Christ in the manger. When I'm in a room with a man and he forgets himself so far as to say to me
IRMA 
Come in!
IRMA 
Is the session over? He went through it fast.
ARTHUR 
Yes, the little geezer's buttoning up. He's pooped. Two sessions in half an hour. With all that shooting in the street, I wonder whether he'll get back to his hotel. (He imitates the JUDGE in Scene Two.) Minos judges you. . . . Minos weighs you . . . Cerberus? Bow-wow! Bow-wow! (He shows his fangs and laughs.) Hasn't the Chief of Police arrived?
IRMA 
You went easy, I hope? Last time, the poor girl was laid up for two days.
ARTHUR 
Don't pull that kind-hearted-whore stuff on me. Both last time and tonight she got what was coming to her
IRMA 
At least you don't get any pleasure out of it?
ARTHUR 
Not with her. You're my only love. And a job's a job. I'm conscientious about my work.
IRMA 
I'm not jealous of the girl, but I wouldn't want you to disable the personnel. It's getting harder and harder ro replace.
ARTHUR 
I tried a couple of times to draw marks on her back with purple paint, but it didn't work. The old guy inspects her when he arrives and insists I deliver her in good shape.
IRMA 
Paint? Who gave you permission? (To CARMEN) My Turkish slippers, darling.
ARTHUR 
What's one illusion more or less! I thought I was doing the right thing. But don't worry. Now I whip, I flagellate, she screams, and he crawls.
IRMA 
See to it she doesn't scream so loud. The house is being watched.
ARTHUR 
The radio has just announced that all the north part of town was taken last night. And the Judge wants screaming. The Bishop's less dangerous. He's satisfied with pardoning sins.
CARMEN 
Though he gets pleasure out of pardoning, he expects you to commit them. No, the best of the lot is the one you tie up, spank, whip and soothe, and then he snores.
ARTHUR 
Who cuddles him? (To Carmen) You? Do you give him your breast?
CARMEN 
I do my job right. And in any case, Mr. Arthur, you're wearing an outfit that doesn't allow you to joke. The pimp has a grin, never a smile.
IRMA 
She's right.
ARTHUR 
How much did you take in today?
IRMA 
Carmen and I haven't finished the accounts.
ARTHUR 
But I have. According to my calculations, it runs to a good two hundred.
IRMA 
That's possible. In any case, don't worry. I don't cheat.
ARTHUR 
I believe you, my love, but I can't help it
IRMA 
You'd be cowering in a cellar, paralysed with fear.
ARTHUR 
I'd do as the others do, my love. I'd wait to be saved by the Chief of Police. You're not forgetting my little percentage?
IRMA 
I give you what you need.
ARTHUR 
My love! I've ordered the silk shirts. And do you know what kind of silk? And what colour? In the purple silk of your blouse!
IRMA 
All right, cut it. Not in front of Carmen.
ARTHUR 
Then it's O.K.?
IRMA 
Yes.
ARTHUR 
How much?
IRMA 
We'll see. I have to go over the accounts with Carmen. (Winningly) It'll be as much as I can. For the moment, you've absolutely got to go to meet George. . . .
ARTHUR 
I beg your pardon, my beloved?
IRMA 
To go to meet Mr. George. To Police Headquarters, if necessary, and to let him know that I'm relying only on him.
ARTHUR 
You're kidding, I hope? . . .
IRMA 
The tone of my last remark should answer your question. I'm no longer playing. Or, if you like, not the same role. And there's no longer any need for you to play the mean, soft-hearted pimp. Do as I tell you, but first take the atomizer. (To Carmen, who brings the object) Give it to him. (To Arthur) And on your knees!
ARTHUR 
In the street? All by myself? . . . Me? . . .
IRMA 
I've got to know what's happening to George. I can't remain unprotected.
ARTHUR 
I'm here . . .
IRMA 
I've got to defend my jewels, my studios, my girls. The Chief of Police should have been here a half-hour ago. . . .
ARTHUR 
Me in the street! . . . But it's hailing . . . they're shooting. . . . (He points to his suit.) And I got dressed up to stay here, to go walking through the corridors and look at myself in your mirrors. And also for you to see me dressed up as a pimp. . . . All I've got to protect me is the silk. . . .
IRMA 
Let me have my bracelets, Carmen. (To Arthur) And you, spray.
ARTHUR 
I'm not meant for outdoors. I've been living within your walls too long. Even my skin couldn't tolerate the fresh air . . . maybe if I had a veil. . . . What if I were recognized? . . .
IRMA 
Hug the walls. (A pause.) Take this revolver.
ARTHUR 
On me?
IRMA 
In your pocket.
ARTHUR 
My pocket! Imagine me having to shoot? . . .
IRMA 
So now you're crammed full of what you are? Gorged?
ARTHUR 
Gorged, that's right. . . . (A pause.) Rested, gorged . . . but if I go out into the street. . . .
IRMA 
You're right. No revolver. But take off your hat and go where I tell you, and come back and let me know what's going on. You have a session this evening. Did you know? (He tosses his hat away.)
ARTHUR 
This evening? Another one? What is it?
IRMA 
I thought I told you
ARTHUR 
What am I supposed to do with it?
IRMA 
Nothing. You're to remain motionless, and you'll be buried. You'll be able to rest.
ARTHUR 
Ah, because I'm the one who. . . ? Ah, O.K. All right. Who's the client? Someone new?
IRMA 
A very important person, and stop asking questions. Get going.
ARTHUR 
Don't I get a kiss?
IRMA 
When we come back. If we come back.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
No, no, stay, Carmen. I like having you around. As for the gigolo, let him find me.
IRMA 
Put your hand here. (On her breast.) I'm all tense. I'm still wrought up. I knew you were on your way, which meant you were in danger. I waited for you all a-tremble . . . while perfuming myself. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
All right, that'll do. Let's cut the comedy. The situation's getting more and more serious—it's not desperate, but it will be before long—hap-pi-ly! The Royal Palace is surrounded. The Queen's in hiding. The city—it's a miracle that I got through—the city's being ravaged by fire and sword. Out there the rebellion is tragic and joyous, whereas in this house everything's dying a slow death. So, today's my day. By tonight I'll be in the grave or on a pedestal. So whether I love you or desire you is unimportant. How are things going at the moment?
IRMA 
Marvellously. I had some great performances.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
What kind?
IRMA 
Carmen has a talent for description. Ask her.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Tell me, Carmen, still. . . ?
CARMEN 
Yes, sir, still. Still the pillars of the Empire
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Our allegories, our talking weapons. And is there also. . . ?
CARMEN 
As every week, a new theme.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Fine. But. . . .
CARMEN 
He's charming, Sir. And so sad!
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Is that all?
CARMEN 
And so pretty when you unswaddle him. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Are you pulling my leg, Carmen? I'm asking you whether I'm in it?
CARMEN 
Whether you're in it?
IRMA 
You're not in it.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Not yet? (To Carmen.) Well, yes or no, is there a simulation. . . .
CARMEN 
Simulation?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
You idiot! Yes! An impersonation of the Chief of Police?
IRMA 
The time's not ripe. My dear, your function isn't noble enough to offer dreamers an image that would console them. Perhaps because it lacks illustrious ancestors? No, my dear fellow. . . . You have to resign yourself to the fact that your image does not yet conform to the liturgies of the brothel.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Who's represented in them?
IRMA 
You know who. You have your index-cards. (She enumerates on her fingers.) There are two kings of France with coronation ceremonies and different rituals, an admiral at the stern of his sinking destroyer, a dey of Algiers surrendering, a fireman putting out a fire, a goat attached to a stake, a housewife returning from market, a pickpocket, a robbed man who's bound and beaten up, a Saint Sebastian, a farmer in his barn . . . but no chief of police . . . nor colonial administrator, though there is a missionary dying on the cross, and Christ in person.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
You're forgetting the mechanic.
IRMA 
He doesn't come any more. What with tightening screws, he'd have ended by constructing a machine. And it might have worked. Back to the factory!
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
So not a single one of your clients has had the idea . . . the remotest idea, the barest suggestion. . . .
IRMA 
No. I know you do what you can. You try hatred and love. But glory gives you the cold shoulder.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
My image is growing bigger and bigger. It's becoming colossal. Everything around me repeats and reflects it. And you've never seen it represented in this place?
IRMA 
In any case, even if it were celebrated here, I wouldn't see anything. The ceremonies are secret.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
You liar. You've got secret peep-holes in every wall. Every partition, every mirror, is rigged. In one place, you can hear the sighs, in another the echo of the moans. You don't need me to tell you that brothel tricks are mainly mirror tricks. . . . (Very sadly) Nobody yet! But I'll make my image detach itself from me. I'll make it penetrate into your studios, force its way in, reflect and multiply itself. Irma, my function weighs me down. Here, it will appear to me in the blazing light of pleasure and death. (Musingly) Of death.
IRMA 
You must keep killing, my dear George.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
I do what I can, I assure you. People fear me more and more.
IRMA 
Not enough. You must plunge into darkness, into shit and blood. (With sudden anguish) And must kill whatever remains of our love.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Everything's dead.
IRMA 
That's a fine victory. So you've got to kill what's around you.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
I repeat
IRMA 
You're raving. Or else you really do expect to build an empire. In which ease you're raving.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
When the rebellion's been put down, and put down by me, when I've the nation behind me and been appealed to by the Queen, nothing can stop me. Then, and only then, will you see who I now am! (Musingly) Yes, my dear, I want to build an empire . . . so that the empire will, in exchange, build me. . . .
IRMA 
. . . a tomb.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
But, after all, why not? Doesn't every conqueror have one? So? (Exalted) Alexandria! I'll have my tomb, Irma. And when the cornerstone is laid, you'll be my guest of honour.
IRMA 
Thank you. (To Carmen
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Just a minute, Carmen. What do you think of the idea?
CARMEN 
That you want to merge your life with one long funeral, sir.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Is life anything else? You seem to know everything—so tell me
CARMEN 
As for anything serious, anything worth reporting, only one thing
IRMA 
That's not what the Chief of Police is asking.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
I'm used to Carmen's speeches. (To Carmen
CARMEN 
And yet, I'm sure that the sudden joy in their eyes when they see the cheap finery is really the gleam of innocence. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
People claim that our house sends them to Death. (Suddenly a ringing. IRMA starts. A pause.)
IRMA 
Someone's opened the door. Who can it be at this hour? (To Carmen) Carmen, go down and shut the door.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
My tomb!
IRMA 
It was I who rang. I wanted to be alone with you for a moment. (A pause, during which they look into each other's eyes seriously.) Tell me, George. . . . (She hesitates.) Do you still insist on keeping up the game? No, no, don't be impatient. Aren't you tired of it?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
But. . . . In a little while I'll be going home.
IRMA 
If you can. If the rebellion leaves you free to go.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
The rebellion is a game. From here you can't see anything of the outside, but every rebel is playing a game. And he loves his game.
IRMA 
But supposing they let themselves be carried beyond the game? I mean if they get so involved in it that they destroy and replace everything. Yes, yes, I know, there's always the false detail that reminds them that at a certain moment, at a certain point in the drama, they have to stop, and even withdraw. . . . But what if they're so carried away by passion that they no longer recognize anything and leap, without realizing it, into. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
You mean into reality? What of it? Let them try. I do as they do, I penetrate right into the reality that the game offers us, and since I have the upper hand, it's I who score.
IRMA 
They'll be stronger than you.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Why do you say “they'll be"? I've left the members of my bodyguard in one of your studios. So I'm always in contact with my various departments. All right, enough of that. Are you or aren't you the mistress of a house of illusions? Good. If I come to your place, it's to find satisfaction in your mirrors and their trickery. (Tenderly) Don't worry. Everything will be just as it's always been.
IRMA 
I don't know why, but today I feel uneasy. Carmen seems strange to me. The rebels—how shall I put it?—have a kind of gravity. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Their role requires it.
IRMA 
No, no . . . of determination. They walk by the windows threateningly, but they don't sing. The threat is in their eyes.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
What of it? Supposing it is, do you take me for a coward? Do you think I should give up and go home?
IRMA 
No. Besides, I think it's too late.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Do you have any news?
IRMA 
From Chantal, before she lit out. The power-house will be occupied around 3 a.m.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Are you sure? Who told her?
IRMA 
The partisans of the Fourth Sector.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
That's plausible. How did she find out?
IRMA 
It's through her that there were leaks, and through her alone. So don't belittle my house. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Your cat-house, my love.
IRMA 
Cat-house, whore-house, bawdy-house. Brothel. Fuckery. Call it anything you like. So Chantal's the only one who's on the other side. . . . She lit out. But before she did, she confided in Carmen, and Carmen's no fool.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Who tipped her off?
IRMA 
Roger. The plumber. How do you imagine him? Young and handsome? No. He's forty. Thick-set. Serious, with ironic eyes. Chantal spoke to him. I put him out
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Andromeda? Splendid. The rebellion's riding high, it's moving out of this world. If it gives its sectors the names of constellations, it'll evaporate in no time and be metamorphosed into song. Let's hope the songs are beautiful.
IRMA 
And what if their songs give the rebels courage? What if they're willing to die for them?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
The beauty of their songs will make them soft. Unfortunately, they haven't yet reached the point of either beauty or softness. In any case, Chantal's tender passions were providential.
IRMA 
Don't bring God into. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
I'm a freemason. Therefore. . . .
IRMA 
You? You never told me.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret.
IRMA 
You, a brother in a little apron! With a hood and taper and a little mallet! That's odd. (A pause.) You too?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Why? You too?
IRMA 
I'm a guardian of far more solemn rites. (Suddenly sad) Since that's all I am now.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
As usual, you're going to bring up our grand passion.
IRMA 
No, not our passion, but the time when we loved each other.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Well, would you like to give a historical account of it and deliver a eulogy? You think my visits would have less zest if you didn't flavour them with the memory of a pretended innocence?
IRMA 
It's a question of tenderness. Neither the wildest concoctions of my clients nor my own fancies nor my constant endeavour to enrich my studios with new themes nor the passing of time nor the gilding and crystals nor bitter cold can dispel the moments when you cuddled in my arms or keep me from remembering them.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Do you really miss them?
IRMA 
I'd give my kingdom to relive a single one of them! And you know which one. I need just one word of truth—as when one looks at one's wrinkles at night, or rinses one's mouth. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
It's too late. (A pause.) Besides, we couldn't cuddle each other eternally. You don't know what I was already secretly moving towards when I was in your arms.
IRMA 
I know that I loved you.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
It's too late. Could you give up Arthur?
IRMA 
It was you who forced him on me. You insisted on there being a man here—against my better judgment—in a domain that should have remained virgin. . . . You fool, don't laugh. Virgin, that is, sterile. But you wanted a pillar, a shaft, a phallus present—an upright bulk. Well, it's here. You saddled me with that hunk of congested meat, that milksop with wrestler's arms. He may look like a strong-man at a fair, but you don't realize how fragile he is.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Be Still.
IRMA 
And you relaxed here through Arthur. I need him now. I have no illusions. I'm his man and he relies on me, but I need that rugged shop-window dummy hanging on to my skirts. He's my body, as it were, but set beside me.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
What if I were jealous?
IRMA 
Of that big doll made up as an executioner in order to satisfy a phony judge? You're kidding, but the spectacle of me under the spectacle of that magnificent body never used to bother you. . . . Let me repeat. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
And don't blubber or I'll break your jaw, and I'll send your joint up in smoke. I'll set fire to your hair and bush and I'll turn you loose. I'll light up the town with blazing whores. (Very gently) Do you think I'm capable of it?
IRMA 
Yes, darling.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
All right, add up the accounts for me. If you like, you can deduct Apollo's crêpe de Chine. And hurry up. I've got to get back to my post. For the time being, I have to act. Afterwards. . . . Afterwards, things'll run themselves. My name will act in my place. Well, what about Arthur?
IRMA 
He'll be dead this evening.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Dead? You mean . . . really . . . really dead?
IRMA 
Come, come, George, the way one dies here.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Indeed? Meaning. . . .
IRMA 
The Minister. . . . (She is interrupted by the voice of CARMEN.)
CARMEN 
Lock Studio 17! Elyane, hurry up! And lower the studio . . . no, no, wait. . . .(We hear the sound of a rusty cog-wheel, the kind made by certain old lifts. Enter CARMEN.) Madame, the Queen's Envoy is in the drawing-room. . . .
ARTHUR 
You here! You managed to get through?
IRMA 
Darling! What's the matter? Are you hurt? Speak!
ARTHUR 
I tried to get to Police Headquarters.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
In short, I'm stuck in the whore-house.
IRMA 
Can it be that everything's slipping away? Slipping between my fingers? . . . (bitterly) I still have my jewels . . . my rocks . . . and perhaps not for long. . . .
CARMEN 
If the house is to be blown up. . . . Is Saint Theresa's costume in the closet, Mme Irma?
IRMA 
At the left. But first have Arthur removed. I'm going to receive the Envoy.
CHANTAL 
Keep me, if you will, my love, but keep me in your heart. And wait for me.
ROGER 
I love you with your body, with your hair, your bosom, your belly, your guts, your fluids, your smells. Chantal, I love you in my bed. They. . . .
CHANTAL 
They don't care a rap about me. But without them, I'd be nothing.
ROGER 
You're mine. I . .
CHANTAL 
I know. You dragged me from the grave. And no sooner do I shake off my wrappings than, ungrateful wretch that I am, I gad about like a trollop. I plunge into the adventure, and I escape you. (Suddenly with tender irony.) But Roger, my love, you know I love you, you and only you.
ROGER 
You've just said the word
CHANTAL 
Ah ha! You're jealous of whom, or what? People say that I soar above the insurrection, that I'm its soul and voice, and you—you're rooted to the ground. That's why you're sad. . . .
ROGER 
Chantal, please, don't be vulgar. If you can help. . . .
THE MAN 
Well, is it yes or is it no?
ROGER 
What if she stays there?
THE MAN 
I'm asking you to let us have her for two hours.
ROGER 
Chantal belongs. . . .
CHANTAL 
To nobody!
ROGER 
. . . To my section.
THE MAN 
To the insurrection!
ROGER 
If you want a woman to lead your men forward, then create one.
THE MAN 
We looked for one, but there aren't any. We tried to build one up
CHANTAL 
A woman like me? Another one? All I have is a hoarse voice and a face like an owl's. I give them or lend them for hatred's sake. I'm nothing, only my face, my voice, and inside me a sweet, poisonous kindness. D'you mean to tell me I have two popular rivals, two other poor devils? Let them come, I'll show them! I have no rival.
ROGER 
I snatched her—snatched her from a grave. She's already escaping me and mounting to the sky. If I lend her to you. . . .
THE MAN 
We're not asking you for that. If we take her, we're hiring her.
CHANTAL 
How much?
ROGER 
Even if we let you have her to sing and spur on your district, if she gets bumped off we'll lose everything. No one can replace her.
THE MAN 
She agreed to it.
ROGER 
She doesn't belong to herself any more. She's ours. She's our sign. All that your women are good for is tearing up and carrying stones or reloading guns. I know that's useful, but. . .
THE MAN 
How many women do you want in exchange?
ROGER 
Is a singer on the barricades as precious as all that?
ROGER 
Twenty women? You'd pay me twenty measly women, twenty oxen, twenty head of cattle? So Chantal's something special? And do you know where she comes from?
CHANTAL 
Every morning I go back—because at night I'm ablaze—I go back to a hovel and sleep—chastely, my love!—and drink myself into a stupor on red wine. And I, with my grating voice, my sham anger, my cameo eyes, my painted illumination, my Andalusian hair, I comfort and enchant the rabble. They'll win and my victory will be a strange one.
ROGER 
Twenty women for Chantal?
THE MAN 
A hundred.
ROGER 
And it's probably because of her that we'll win. She already embodies the Revolution. . . .
THE MAN 
A hundred. You agree?
ROGER 
Where are you taking her? And what'll she have to do?
CHANTAL 
We'll see. Don't worry, I was born under a lucky star. As for the rest of it, I realize my power. The people love me, they listen to me, they follow me.
ROGER 
What will she do?
THE MAN 
Hardly anything. As you know, we're attacking the Palace at dawn. Chantal will go in first. She'll sing from a balcony. That's all.
ROGER 
A hundred women. A thousand and maybe more. So she's no longer a woman. The creature they make of her out of rage and despair has her price. In order to fight against an image Chantal has frozen into an image. The fight is no longer taking place in reality, but in the lists. Field azure. It's the combat of allegories. None of us know any longer why we revolted. So she was bound to come round to that.
THE MAN 
Well, is it yes? Answer, Chantal. It's for you to answer.
CHANTAL 
I'd like us to be alone for a moment.
ROGER 
I didn't steal you for you to become a unicorn or a two-headed eagle.
CHANTAL 
You don't like unicorns.
ROGER 
I've never been able to make love to them. (He caresses her.) Nor to you either.
CHANTAL 
YOU mean I don't know how to love. I disappoint you. Yet I love you. And you hired me out for a hundred female diggers.
ROGER 
Forgive me. I need them. And yet I love you. I love you and I don't know how to tell you. I can't sing. And singing is the last resort.
CHANTAL 
I'll have to leave before day-break. If the North Section has come through, the Queen will be dead in an hour. It'll be the end of the Chief of Police. If not, we'll never get out of this bedlam.
ROGER 
One minute more, my love, my life. It's still night.
CHANTAL 
It's the hour when night breaks away from the day, my dove, let me go.
ROGER 
The minutes without you will be unbearable.
CHANTAL 
We won't be separated, I swear to you. I'll speak to them in an icy tone and at the same time I'll murmur words of love for you. You'll hear them from here, and I'll hear yours.
ROGER 
They may keep you, Chantal. They're strong—strong as death.
CHANTAL 
Don't be afraid, my love. I know their power. Your sweetness and tenderness are stronger. I'll speak to them with severity. I'll tell them what the people demand. They'll listen to me because they'll be afraid. Let me go.
ROGER 
Chantal, I love you!
CHANTAL 
Ah, my love, it's because I love you that I must hurry.
ROGER 
You love me?
CHANTAL 
I love you because you're tender and sweet, you the hardest and sternest of men. And your sweetness and tenderness are such that they make you as light as a shred of tulle, subtle as a flake of mist, airy as a caprice. Your thick muscles, your arms, your thighs, your hands, are more unreal than the melting of day into night. You envelop me and I contain you.
ROGER 
Chantal, I love you because you're hard and stern, you the tenderest and sweetest of women. And your sweetness and tenderness are such that they make you as stern as a lesson, hard as hunger, inflexible as a block of ice. Your breasts, your skin, your hair are more real than the certainty of noon. You envelop me and I contain you.
CHANTAL 
When I stand before them, when I speak to them, I'll be hearing your sighs and moans and the beating of your heart. Let me go.
ROGER 
You still have time. There's still some shadow along the walls. You'll go round the back of the Archbishop's Palace. You know the way.
ONE OF THE REBELS 
It's time, Chantal. Day is breaking.
CHANTAL 
Do you hear? They're calling me.
ROGER 
But why you? You'll never be able to speak to them.
CHANTAL 
I, better than anyone. I'm gifted.
ROGER 
They're clever, cunning. . . .
CHANTAL 
I'll invent gestures, postures, phrases. Before they even say a word, I'll understand, and you'll be proud of my victory.
ROGER 
Let the others go. (He cries out to the rebels.) You go! Or me, if you're afraid. I'll tell them they must give in, because we're the law.
CHANTAL 
Don't listen to him. He's drunk. (To Roger) All they can do is fight, and all you can do is love me. That's the role you've learned to play. As for me, it's something else. At least the brothel has been of some use to me
ROGER 
Chantal!
CHANTAL 
And such artful ones, such cunning and eloquent ones, that my skill and trickery and eloquence are incomparable. I can be familiar with the Queen, the Hero, the General, the heroic Troops . . . and can fool them all.
ROGER 
You know all the roles, don't you? Just now, you were reciting lines to me, weren't you?
CHANTAL 
One learns fast. You yourself. . . .
ONE OF THE REBELS 
Cut the speeches. Get going.
ROGER 
Chantal, stay!
CHANTAL 
I envelop you and I contain you, my love. . . .
ROGER 
. . . and I've had so many partners, and such artful ones, such cunning ones . . . that she did, after all, have to try to give them an answer. The one they wanted. In a little while she'll have cunning and artful partners. She'll be the answer they're waiting for.
THE ENVOY 
For more centuries than I can tell, the centuries have worn themselves thin refining me . . . subtilizing me. . . . (He smiles.) From something or other about the explosion, from its power, in which was mingled a clinking of jewels and broken mirrors, I rather think it was the Royal Palace. (The characters all look at each other, horror-stricken.) Let us not display any emotion. So long as we are not like that . . . . (He points to the corpse of Arthur.)
IRMA 
He didn't think he'd be acting his role of corpse this evening in earnest.
THE ENVOY 
Our dear Minister of the Interior would have been delighted had not he himself met the same fate. It is unfortunately I who have had to replace him in his mission here, and I have no taste for pleasures of this kind. (He touches Arthur's corpse with his foot.) Yes, this body would have sent our dear Minister into raptures.
IRMA 
Not at all, your Excellency. It's make-believe that these gentlemen want. The Minister desired a fake corpse. But this one is real. Look at it
THE ENVOY 
He was therefore meant for grandeur.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Him? He was a spineless dummy.
THE ENVOY 
He was, like us, haunted by a quest of immobility. By what we call the hieratic. And, in passing, allow me to pay tribute to the imagination responsible for there being a funeral parlour in this house.
IRMA 
And you see only part of it.
THE ENVOY 
Whose idea was it?
IRMA 
The Wisdom of Nations, your Excellency.
THE ENVOY 
It does things well. But we were talking about the Queen, to protect whom is my mission.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
You're going about it in a curious way. The Palace, according to what you say. . . .
THE ENVOY 
For the time being, Her Majesty is in safety. But time is pressing. The prelate is said to have been beheaded. The Archbishop's Palace has been ransacked. The Law Court and Military Headquarters have been routed. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
But what about the Queen?
THE ENVOY 
She's embroidering. For a moment she thought of nursing the wounded. But it was pointed out to her that, as the throne was threatened, she had to carry to an extreme the Royal prerogatives.
IRMA 
Which are?
THE ENVOY 
Absence. Her Majesty has retired to a chamber, in solitude. The disobedience of her people saddens her. She is embroidering a handkerchief. The design of it is as follows
IRMA 
Is the Queen amused?
THE ENVOY 
Her Majesty is occupying herself in becoming entirely what she must be
IRMA 
And she's embroidering.
THE ENVOY 
No, Madame, I say the Queen is embroidering a handkerchief, for though it is my duty to describe her, it is also my duty to conceal her.
IRMA 
Do you mean she's not embroidering?
THE ENVOY 
I mean that the Queen is embroidering and that she is not embroidering. She picks her nose, examines the pickings and lies down again. Then, she dries the dishes.
IRMA 
The Queen?
THE ENVOY 
She is not nursing the wounded. She is embroidering an invisible handkerchief. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
By God! What have you done with Her Majesty? I want a straight answer. I'm not amused. . . .
THE ENVOY 
She is in a chest. She is sleeping. Wrapped in the folds of Royalty, she is snoring. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Is the Queen dead?
THE ENVOY 
She is snoring and she is not snoring. Her head, which is tiny, supports, without wavering, a crown of metal and stones.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Enough of that. You said the Palace was in danger. . . . What's to be done? I still have almost the entire police force behind me. Those who are still with me are ready to die for me. . . . They know who I am and what I'll do for them. . . . I, too, have my role to play. But if the Queen is dead, everything is jeopardized. She's my support, it's in her name that I'm working to make a name for myself. How far has the rebellion gone? I want a clear answer.
THE ENVOY 
You can judge from the state of this house. And from your own. . . . All seems lost.
IRMA 
YOU belong to the Court, your Excellency. Before coming here, I was with the troops. That's where I won my first spurs. I can assure you that I've known worse situations. The populace—from which I broke away with a kick of my heels—the populace is howling beneath my windows, which have been multiplied by the bombs
THE ENVOY 
The Queen is standing on one foot in the middle of an empty room, and she. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
That'll do! I've had enough of your riddles. For me, the Queen has to be someone. And the situation has to be concrete. Describe it to me exactly. I've no time to waste.
THE ENVOY 
Whom do you want to save?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
The Queen!
CARMEN 
The flag!
IRMA 
My hide!
THE ENVOY 
If you're eager to save the Queen—and, beyond her, our flag, and all its gold fringe, and its eagle, cords and pole, would you describe them to me?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Until now I've served the things you mention, and served them with distinction, and without bothering to know any more about them than what I saw. And I'll continue. What's happening about the rebellion?
THE ENVOY 
The garden gates will, for a moment longer, hold back the crowd. The guards are devoted, like us, with an obscure devotion. They'll die for their sovereign. They'll give their blood. Unhappily there won't be enough of it to drown the rebellion. Sand bags have been piled up in front of the doors. In order to confuse even reason, Her Majesty removes herself from one secret chamber to another, from the servants’ hall to the Throne Room, from the latrines to the chicken-coop, the chapel, the guard-room. . . . She makes herself unfindable and thus attains a threatened invisibility. So much for the inside of the Palace.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
What about the Generalissimo?
THE ENVOY 
Gone mad. He wanders among the crowd, where nobody will harm him, protected by his madness.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
What about the Attorney-General?
THE ENVOY 
Died of fright.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
And the Bishop?
THE ENVOY 
His case is more difficult. The Church is secretive. Nothing is known about him. Nothing definite. His decapitated head was said to have been seen on the handlebars of a bicycle. Of course, the rumour was false. We're therefore relying entirely on you. But your orders aren't getting through.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Down below, in the corridors and studios, I have enough loyal men to protect us all. They can remain in contact with my offices. . . .
THE ENVOY 
Are your men in uniform?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Of course. They're my bodyguard. Do you imagine me with a bodyguard in sport jackets? They're in uniform. Black ones. With my emblem. They're brave. They, too, want to win.
THE ENVOY 
To save what?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
But, after all, in coming to see me, you did have something definite in mind, didn't you? You had a plan? Let's hear it.
THE ENVOY 
That may have been the Royal Palace. Long live the Royal Palace!
IRMA 
But then, just before . . . the explosion?
THE ENVOY 
A royal palace is forever blowing up. In fact, that's exactly what it is
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
But the Queen. . . . Then the Queen's under the rubble?
THE ENVOY 
You need not worry. Her Majesty is in a safe place. And that phoenix, when dead, can rise up from the ashes of a royal palace. I can understand your impatience to prove your valour, your devotion . . . but the Queen will wait for you as long as necessary. (To Irma
IRMA 
You're forgetting to whom you're speaking. I may run a brothel, but I wasn't born of the marriage of the moon and a crocodile, I've lived among the people. . . . All the same, it was quite a blast. And the people. . . .
THE ENVOY 
That's behind you. When life departs, the hands cling to a sheet. What significance has that rag when you're about to penetrate into the providential fixity?
IRMA 
Sir? Do you mean I'm at my last gasp?
THE ENVOY 
Splendid head! Sturdy thighs! Solid shoulders!
IRMA 
So I've been told, and it didn't make me lose my head. In short, I'll make a presentable corpse if the rebels act fast and if they leave me intact. But if the Queen is dead. . . .
THE ENVOY 
Long live the Queen, Madame.
IRMA 
I don't like to be kidded! Pack up your nonsense, and clear out.
THE ENVOY 
I've described the situation. The populace, in its joy and fury, is at the brink of ecstasy. It's for us to press it forward.
THE ENVOY 
No. A queen who's been cooked and mashed up isn't presentable. And even when alive she was less beautiful than you.
IRMA 
Her lineage was more ancient . . . she was older. . . . And, after all, maybe she was just as frightened as I.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
It is in order to approach her, to be worthy of her, that one makes such a mighty effort. But what if one is Herself?
IRMA 
I don't know how to talk. I'm always hemming and hawing.
THE ENVOY 
All must unfold in a silence that etiquette allows no one to break.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
I'm going to have the rubble of the Palace cleared away. If, as you said, the Queen was in a chest, it may be possible to save her.
THE ENVOY 
It was made of rosewood! And it was so old, so worn. . . . (To Irma, running his hand over the back of her neck)
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
. . . and resist the axe, don't they? Irma, don't listen to him! (To the Envoy.) And what about me? I'm the strong-man of this country, but it's because I've based my power on the crown. I bamboozle the great majority, but it's because I had the smart idea of serving the Queen . . . even if at times I've seemed to do some shabby things . . . seemed to, d'you hear? . . . It's not Irma. . . .
IRMA 
I'm really very weak, your Excellency, and very frail. Though a while ago I was boasting. . . .
THE ENVOY 
Around this delicate and precious kernel we'll forge a shell of gold and iron. But you must make up your mind quickly.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Above me! So Irma would be above me! All the trouble I've gone to in order to be master would be wasted effort. Whereas, nice and snug in her studio, all she'd have to do is nod her head. . . . If I'm in power, I'm willing to impose Irma. . . .
THE ENVOY 
Impossible. It's from her that you must derive your authority. She must appear by divine right. Don't forget that you're not yet represented in her studios.
IRMA 
Allow me just a little more respite. . . .
THE ENVOY 
A few seconds, for time is pressing.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
If only there were some way of knowing what the late sovereign would have thought of it. We can't decide just like that. To appropriate a heritage. . . .
THE ENVOY 
You're knuckling under already. Do you tremble if there's no authority above you to decide? But it's for Mme Irma to declare. . . .
IRMA 
In the records of our family, which goes a long way back, there was some question of. . . .
THE ENVOY 
Nonsense, Mme Irma. In our vaults, genealogists are working day and night. History is submissive to them. I said we hadn't a minute to waste in conquering our people, but beware! Although the populace may worship you, its high-flown pride is capable of sacrificing you. It sees you as red, either crimson or blood-red. If it kills its idols and thrusts them into the sewers, it will sweep you up with them. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
It's an enormous risk. . . .
CARMEN 
That's for Mme Irma to decide. (To Irma.) The ornaments are ready.
IRMA 
Are you quite sure of what you're saying? Do you really know what's going on? What about your spies?
THE ENVOY 
They inform us as accurately as the peep-holes that peer into your studios. (Smiling.) And I may add that we consult them with the same pleasurable thrill. But we must act fast. We're engaged in a race against the clock. It's we or they. Mme. Irma, think speedily.
IRMA 
I'm hurrying, sir. I'm approaching my destiny as fast as I can. (To CARMEN
CARMEN 
I've locked them up.
IRMA 
Get them ready.
THE ENVOY 
What about you, what's to be done with you?
CARMEN 
I'm here for eternity.
THE ENVOY 
One other matter, a more delicate one. I mentioned an image that for some days now has been mounting in the sky of the revolution.
IRMA 
The revolution has its sky too?
THE ENVOY 
Don't envy it. Chantal's image is circulating in the streets. An image that resembles her and does not resemble her. She towers above the battles. At first, people were fighting against illustrious and illusory tyrants, then for freedom. Tomorrow they'll be ready to die for Chantal alone.
IRMA 
The ungrateful wretch! She who was in such demand as Lucrezia Borgia.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
She won't last. She's like me
THE ENVOY 
Everything beautiful on earth you owe to masks. (Suddenly a bell rings. IRMA is about to dart forward, but stops.)
IRMA 
It's Carmen. What's she saying? What are they doing?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
While waiting to go home, they're standing around looking at themselves in the mirrors.
IRMA 
Tell her to smash the mirrors or veil them.
THE ENVOY 
Do you have the outfits?
IRMA 
My closets are as famous as my studios. (Suddenly worried.) But everything must be in an awful state! The bombs, the plaster, the dust. Tell Carmen to brush the costumes! (To the Chief of Police
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
But I love you.
THE ENVOY 
Think of that mountain north of the city. All the labourers were at work when the rebellion broke out. . . . (A pause.) I refer to a project for a tomb. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
What's the plan of it?
THE ENVOY 
Later. A mountain of red marble hollowed out with rooms and niches, and in the middle a tiny diamond sentry-box.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Will I be able to stand there—or sit—and keep vigil over my entire death?
THE ENVOY 
He who gets it will be there—dead—for eternity. The world will centre about it. About it will rotate the planets and the suns. From a secret point of the same room will run a road that will lead, after many and many a complication, to another room where mirrors will reflect to infinity . . . I say infinity. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
O.K.!
THE ENVOY 
. . . the image of a dead man.
IRMA 
So I'll be real? My robe will be real? My lace, my jewels will be real? The rest of the world. . . .
THE ENVOY 
Yes, but make haste. Go to your apartments. Embroider an interminable handkerchief. . . . (To the Chief of Police
T
MME IRMA, wearing a diadem on her brow and an ermine cloak. All the characters step forward and take their positions with great timidity. They are silent. They simply show themselves. All are of huge proportions, gigantic—except the Hero, that is, THE CHIEF OF POLICE—and are wearing their ceremonial garments, which are torn and dusty. Then, near them, but not on the balcony, appears the beggar. In a gentle voice, he cries out
THE BEGGAR
Long live the Queen! (He goes off timidly, as he came.) (Finally, a strong wind stirs the curtains
THE JUDGE 
What we've been through!
THE GENERAL 
And it's not over! We have to invent an entire life. . . . That's hard. . . .
THE BISHOP 
Hard or not, we've got to go through with it. We can no longer back out. Before entering the carriage. . . .
THE GENERAL 
The slowness of the carriage!
THE BISHOP 
. . . entering the carriage, it was still possible to chuck the whole business. But now. . . .
THE JUDGE 
Do you think we were recognized? I was in the middle, hidden by your profiles. Opposite me, Irma. . . . (The name astonishes him.) Irma? The Queen. . . . The Queen hid my face. . . . Do you think we were?
THE BISHOP 
No danger of that. You know whom I saw . . . at the right (unable to keep from laughing) with his fat, good-natured mug and pink cheeks, though the town was in smithereens? (The other two smile.) With his dimples and decayed teeth? And who threw himself on my hand . . . I thought to bite me, and I was about to pull away my fingers . . . to kiss my ring? Who? My fruit-and-vegetable man. (THE JUDGE laughs.)
THE GENERAL 
The slowness of the carriage. The carriage wheels on the people's feet and hands! The dust!
THE JUDGE 
I was opposite the Queen. Through the back window, a woman. . . .
THE BISHOP 
I saw her too, at the left-hand door, she was running along and throwing kisses at us!
THE GENERAL 
The slowness of the carriage! We moved forward so slowly amidst the sweaty mob! Their roars were like threats, but they were only cheering. Someone could have hamstrung the horses, fired a shot, could have unhitched the traces and harnessed us, attached us to the shaft or the horses, could have drawn and quartered us or turned us into draught-horses. But no. Just flowers tossed from a window, and a people hailing its queen, who stood upright beneath her golden crown. (A pause.) And the horses going at a walking pace . . . and the Envoy standing on the footboard!
THE BISHOP 
No one could have recognized us. We were in the gold and glitter. They were blinded. It hit them in the eye. . . .
THE JUDGE 
It wouldn't have taken much. . . .
THE BISHOP 
Exhausted by the fighting, choked by the dust, the people stood waiting for the procession. The procession was all they saw. In any case, we can no longer back out. We've been chosen.
THE GENERAL 
By whom?
THE BISHOP 
By glory in person.
THE GENERAL 
This masquerade?
THE BISHOP 
It lies with us for this masquerade to change meaning. First, we must use words that magnify. We must act fast, and with precision. No errors allowed. (With authority) As for me, instead of being merely the symbolic head of the country's church, I've decided to become its actual head. Instead of blessing and blessing and blessing until I've had my fill, I'm going to sign decrees and appoint priests. The clergy is being organized. A basilica is under construction. It's all in there. (He points to a folder under his arm.) Full of plans and projects. (To the Judge) What about you?
THE JUDGE 
I have an appointment with a number of magistrates. We're drafting bills, we're revising the legal code. (To the General) What about you?
THE GENERAL 
Oh, me, your ideas drift through my poor head like smoke through a log shanty. The art of war's not something you can master just like that. The general-staffs. . . .
THE BISHOP 
Like everything else, the fate of arms can be read in your stars. Read your stars, damn it!
THE GENERAL 
That's easy to say. But when the Hero comes back, planted firmly on his rump, as if on a horse. . . . For, of course, nothing's happened yet?
THE BISHOP 
Nothing. But let's not crow too soon. Though his image hasn't yet been consecrated by the brothel, it still may. If so, we're done for. Unless you make a positive effort to seize power.
THE BISHOP 
Indeed, you're here. Please do your job quickly, and in silence, if possible. You're to take each of our profiles, one smiling, the other rather stern.
FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER 
We'll do our job, don't worry. (To the Bishop
THE B
In fervent meditation.
FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER 
Right, fervent. Get set.
THE BISHOP 
But. . . how?
FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER 
Don't you know how to compose yourself for prayer? Okay, facing both God and the camera. Hands together. Head up. Eyes down. That's the classical pose. A return to order, a return to classicism.
THE BISHOP 
Like this?
FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER 
That's it. . . . (He looks at the camera.) No you're not in the frame. . . . (Shuffling on his knees, the BISHOP places himself in front of the camera.) Okay.
SECOND PHOTOGRAPHER 
Would you mind pulling a longer face? You don't quite look like a judge. A little longer.
THE JUDGE 
Horselike? Sullen?
SECOND PHOTOGRAPHER 
Horselike and sullen, my Lord. And both hands in front, on your brief. What I want is a shot of the Judge. A good photographer is one who gives a definitive image. Perfect.
FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER 
Turn your head . . . just a little. . . . (He turns the Bishop's head.)
THE BISHOP 
You're unscrewing the neck of a prelate!
FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER 
I want a three-quarter view of you praying, my Lord.
SECOND PHOTOGRAPHER 
My Lord, if you possibly can, a little more severity . . . with a pendulous lip.
THE GENERAL 
The finest pose is Poniatovsky's.
THIRD PHOTOGRAPHER 
With the sword?
THE GENERAL 
No, no. That's Lafayette. No, with the arm extended and the marshal's baton. . . .
THIRD PHOTOGRAPHER 
Ah, you mean Wellington?
THE GENERAL 
Unfortunately, I don't have a baton. . . . (Meanwhile, the FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER has gone back to the Bishop, who has not moved, and looks him over silently.)
THIRD PHOTOGRAPHER 
We've got just what we need. Here, now strike the pose. (Rolls up a sheet of paper in the form of a marshal's baton. He hands it to the General, who strikes a pose, and then dashes to his camera. A flash
THE BISHOP 
I hope the negative comes out well. Now we'll have to flood the world with a picture of me receiving the Eucharist. Unfortunately, we don't have a Host on hand. . . .
FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER 
Leave it to us, Monsignor. Newspapermen are a resourceful bunch. (Calls out) My Lord!
I
THE GENERAL has just been photographed; he resumes his natural pose.) Damn it! I don't have a thing! (He looks about. To the General) That's perfect. May I? (Without waiting for an answer, he takes the General's monocle from his eye and goes back to the group formed by THE BISHOP and THE JUDGE. He makes THE JUDGE hold the monocle above the Bishop's tongue as if it were a Host, and he rushes to his camera. A flash.)
THE ENVOY 
It's a true image, born of a false spectacle.
FIRST PHOTOGRAPHER 
That's common practice, your Majesty. When some rebels were captured, we paid a militiaman to bump off a chap I'd just sent to buy me a packet of cigarettes. The photo shows a rebel shot down while trying to escape.
THE QUEEN 
Monstrous!
THE ENVOY 
But have things ever happened otherwise? History was lived so that a glorious page might be written, and then read. It's reading that counts. (To the photographers) Gentlemen, the Queen informs me that she congratulates you. She asks that you return to your posts.
THE QUEEN 
Isn't he here?
THE ENVOY 
The Queen would like to know what you're doing, what you plan to do.
THE BISHOP 
We've been recovering as many dead bodies as possible. We were planning to embalm them and lodge them in our heaven. Your grandeur requires your having slaughtered the rebels wholesale. We shall keep for ourselves only a few of our fallen martyrs, to whom we shall pay honour that will honour us.
THE QUEEN 
That will serve my glory, will it not?
THE ENVOY 
The massacres, too, are revels wherein the people indulge to their heart's content in the pleasure of hating us. I am speaking, to be sure, of “our” people. They can at last set up a statue to us in their hearts so as to shower it with blows. At least, I hope so.
THE QUEEN 
Does that mean that leniency and kindness are of no avail?
THE ENVOY 
A St. Vincent de Paul Studio?
THE QUEEN 
You, my Lord, what's being done? I'd ordered fewer death penalties and more sentences to forced labour. I hope the underground galleries are finished? (To the Envoy) It's the word galley-slaves that made me think of the galleries of the Mausoleum. Are they finished?
THE JUDGE 
Completely. And open to the public on Sundays. Some of the arches are completely adorned with the skeletons of prisoners who died during the digging.
THE QUEEN 
Very good. What about the Church? I suppose that anyone who hasn't done at least a week's work on this extraordinary chapel is in a state of mortal sin?
THE GENERAL 
He'll have a hard time attaining glory. The places have been filled for ages. Every niche has its statue. (Fatuously
THE JUDGE 
That's how it always is when one wants to start from the bottom. And particularly by rejecting or neglecting the traditional. The established order of things, as it were.
THE QUEEN 
Yet it was he who saved everything. He wants glory. He insists on breaking open the gates of legend, but he has allowed you to carry on with your ceremonies.
THE BISHOP 
To be frank, Madame, we're no longer concerned with that. As for me, my skirt hampers me, and my hands get caught in the lace. We're going to have to act.
THE QUEEN 
Act? You? You mean to say you're going to strip us of our power?
THE JUDGE 
We have to fulfil our functions, don't we?
THE QUEEN 
Functions! You're planning to overthrow him, to lower him, to take his place!
THE BISHOP 
Somewhere in time—in time or in space!—perhaps there exist high dignitaries invested with absolute dignity and attired with veritable ornaments. . . .
THE QUEEN 
Veritable! And what about those? You mean that those you're wrapped and swathed in—my whole paraphernalia!—which come from my closets, aren't veritable?
THE BISHOP 
Rabbit, sateen, machine-made lace . . . you think we're going to be satisfied with make-believe to the end of our days?
THE QUEEN 
But this morning. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
I think that. . . victory . . . we've won the day. May I sit down?
THE ENVOY 
No, nobody's come yet. Nobody has yet felt the need to abolish himself in your fascinating image.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
That means the projects you submitted to me aren't very effective. (To the Queen) Nothing? Nobody?
THE QUEEN 
Nobody. And yet, the blinds have been drawn again. The men ought to be coming in. Besides, the apparatus has been set up; so we'll be informed by a full peal of bells.
THE ENVOY 
You didn't care for the project I submitted to you this morning. Yet that's the image that haunts you and that ought to haunt others.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Ineffectual.
THE ENVOY 
The executioner's red coat and his axe. I suggested amaranth red and the steel axe.
THE QUEEN 
Studio 14, known as the Studio of Executions. Already been done.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
I'm afraid that they fear and envy a man, but . . . (groping for words) . . . but not a wrinkle, for example, or a curl . . . or a cigar . . . or a whip. The latest image that was proposed to me. . . . I hardly dare mention it to you.
THE JUDGE 
Was it . . . very audacious?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Very. Too audacious. I'd never dare tell you what it was. (Suddenly, he seems to make up his mind.) Gentlemen, I have sufficient confidence in your judgment and devotion. After all, I want to carry on the fight by boldness of ideas as well. It was this
THE QUEEN 
George! You?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
What do you expect? If I'm to symbolize the nation, your joint. . . .
THE ENVOY 
Allow him, Madame. It's the tone of the age.
THE JUDGE 
A phallus? Of great stature? You mean—enormous?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Of my stature.
THE JUDGE 
But that'll be very difficult to bring off.
THE ENVOY 
Not so very. What with new techniques and our rubber industry, remarkable things can be worked out. No I'm not worried about that, but rather . . . (turning to the Bishop) . . . what the Church will think of it?
THE BISHOP 
No definite pronouncement can be made this evening. To be sure, the idea is a bold one. (To the Chief of Police) But if your case is desperate, we shall have to examine the matter. For . . . it would be a formidable figure-head, and if you were to transmit yourself in that guise to posterity. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Would you like to see the model?
THE JUDGE 
It's wrong of you to be impatient. We waited two thousand years to perfect our roles. Keep hoping. . . .
THE GENERAL 
Glory is achieved in combat. You haven't enough illustrious Waterloos to your credit. Keep fighting, or sit down and wait out the regulation two thousand years.
THE QUEEN 
You don't care a damn about his suffering. And it was I who singled you out! I who fished you out of the rooms of my brothel and hired you for his glory. And you agreed to serve him.
THE BISHOP 
It is at this point that a question, and a very serious one, arises
THE QUEEN 
Your conditions, you? Puppets who without their rabbit, as you put it, would be nothing, you, a man who was made to dance naked—in other words, skinned!—on the public squares of Seville and Toledo! and who danced! To the click of castanets! Your conditions, my Lord?
THE BISHOP 
That day I had to dance. As for the rabbit, it's what it must be—the sacred image of ermine—it has the same power.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
For the time being, but. . . .
THE BISHOP 
Exactly. So long as we were in a room in a brothel, we belonged to our own fantasies. But once having exposed them, having named them, having proclaimed them, we're now tied up with human beings, tied to you, and forced to go on with this adventure according to the laws of visibility.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
You have no power. I alone. . . .
THE BISHOP 
Then we shall go back to our rooms and there continue the quest of an absolute dignity. We ought never to have left them. For we were content there, and it was you who came and dragged us away. For ours was a happy state. And absolutely safe. In peace, in comfort, behind shutters, behind padded curtains, protected by a police force that protects brothels, we were able to be a general, judge and bishop to the point of perfection and to the point of rapture! You tore us brutally from that delicious, untroubled state.
THE GENERAL 
My breeches! What joy when I pulled on my breeches! I now sleep in my general's breeches. I eat in my breeches, I waltz—when I waltz—in my breeches, I live in my general's breeches. I'm a general the way one is a priest.
THE JUDGE 
I'm just a dignity represented by a skirt.
THE GENERAL 
At no moment can I prepare myself—I used to start a month in advance!—prepare myself for pulling on my general's boots and breeches. I'm rigged in them for all eternity. By Jove, I no longer dream.
THE BISHOP 
You see, he no longer dreams. Our ornamental purity, our luxurious and barren—and sublime—appearance has been eaten away. It's gone forever. Well and good. But the taste of that bitter delight of responsibility of which I've spoken has remained with us, and we find it to our liking. Our rooms are no longer secret. You hurt us by dragging us into the light. But as for dancing? You spoke of dancing? You referred to that notorious afternoon when, stripped—or skinned, whichever word amuses you—stripped of our priestly ornaments, we had to dance naked on the cathedral square. I danced, I admit it, with people laughing at me, but at least I danced. Whereas now, if ever I have an itch for that kind of thing, I'll have to go on the sly to the Balcony, where there probably is a room prepared for prelates who like to be ballerinas a few hours a week. No, no. . . . We're going to live in the light, but with all that that implies. We—magistrate, soldier, prelate—we're going to act in such a way as to impoverish our ornaments unceasingly! We're going to render them useful! But in order that they be of use, and of use to us—since it's your order that we've chosen to defend—you must be the first to recognize them and pay homage to them.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
I shall be not the hundred-thousandth-reflection-within-a-reflection in a mirror, but the One and Only, into whom a hundred thousand want to merge. If not for me, you'd have all been done for. The expression “beaten hollow” would have had meaning. (He is going to regain his authority increasingly.)
THE QUEEN 
You happen to be wearing that robe this evening simply because you were unable to clear out of the studios in time. You just couldn't tear yourself away from one of your hundred thousand reflections, but the clients are beginning to come back. . . . There's no rush yet, but Carmen has recorded several entries. . . . (To the Chief of Police) Don't let them intimidate you. Before the revolt, there were lots of them. . . . (To the Bishop) If you hadn't had the abominable idea of having Chantal assassinated. . . .
THE BISHOP 
A stray bullet!
THE QUEEN 
Stray or not, Chantal was assassinated on my balcony! When she came back here to see me, to visit her boss. . . .
THE BISHOP 
I had the presence of mind to make her one of our saints.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
A traditional attitude. A churchman's reflex. But there's no need to congratulate yourself. The image of her on our flag has hardly any power. Or rather. . . . I've had reports from all quarters that owing to the possibility that she was playing a double game, Chantal has been condemned by those she was supposed to save. . . .
THE QUEEN 
But then the whole business is starting all over again?
THE ENVOY 
All of it.
THE GENERAL 
Are we going to have to . . . to get into the carriage again? The slowness of the carriage!
THE BISHOP 
If I had Chantal shot, and then canonized, if I had her image blazoned on our flag. . . .
THE QUEEN 
It's my image that ought to be there. . . .
THE ENVOY 
You're already on the postage stamps, on the banknotes, on the seals in the police-stations.
THE GENERAL 
The slowness of the carriage . . .
THE QUEEN 
Will I therefore never be who I am?
THE ENVOY 
Never again.
THE QUEEN 
Every event of my life—my blood that trickles if I scratch myself. . . .
THE ENVOY 
Everything will be written for you with a capital letter.
THE QUEEN 
But that's Death?
THE ENVOY 
It is indeed.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
It means death for all of you. And that's why I'm sure of you. At least, as long as I've not been impersonated, because after that I'll just sit back and take it easy. (Inspired) Besides, I'll know by a sudden weakness of my muscles that my image is escaping from me to go and haunt men's minds. When that happens my visible end will be near. For the time being, and if we have to act . . . (To the Bishop) who will assume real responsibilities? You? (He shrugs.) Be logical
THE JUDGE 
Pretty much.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Very well. That means you've never performed an act for its own sake, but always so that, when linked with other acts, it would make a bishop, a judge, a general. . . .
THE BISHOP 
That's both true and false. For each act contained within itself its leaven of novelty.
THE JUDGE 
We acquired greater dignity thereby.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
No doubt, my Lord, but this dignity, which has become as inhuman as a crystal, makes you unfit for governing men. No, no, gentlemen, above you, more sublime than you, is the Queen. It's from her, for the time being, that you derive your power and your rights. Above her—that to which she refers—is our standard, on which I've blazoned the image of Chantal Victorious, our saint.
THE BISHOP 
Above Her Majesty, whom we venerate, and above her flag, is God, Who speaks through my voice.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
And above God? (A silence.) Well, gentlemen, above God are you, without whom God would be nothing. And above you am I, without whom. . . .
THE JUDGE 
What about the people? The photographers?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
On their knees before the people who are on their knees before God. Therefore. . . .
THE GENERAL 
Sir!
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Lie down! Lie down, General!
THE JUDGE 
My skirt can be tucked up. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Lie down! Since you want to be recognized as a judge, do you want to hold on to your dignity according to my idea of it? And according to the general meaning attached to your dignities? Very well. Must I therefore grant you increasing recognition along these lines? Yes or no? (No one answers.)
THE QUEEN 
Excuse him, if he gets carried away. I'm quite aware of what you used to come here for
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
That's a relief to you, isn't it? You never really wanted to get out of yourselves and communicate, if only by acts of meanness, with the world. I understand you. (Amiably) My role, unfortunately, is in motion. In short, as you probably know, it's not in the nomenclature of the brothels. . . .
THE QUEEN 
In the pink handbook.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Yes, in the pink handbook. (To the Three Figures) Come now, gentlemen, don't you feel sorry for a poor fellow like me? (He looks at them one after the other.) Come, come, gentlemen, you're not hardhearted, are you? It's for you that these Studios and Illustrious Rites were perfected, by means of exquisite experimentation. They required long labour, infinite patience, and you want to go back to the light of day? (Almost humble, and suddenly looking very very tired) Wait just a little while. For the time being, I'm still loaded with future acts, loaded with actions . . . but as soon as I feel I'm being multiplied ad infinitum, then . . . then, ceasing to be hard, I'll go and rot in people's minds. And you, get into your skirts again if you want to, and get back on the job. (To THE BISHOP) You're silent. (A long silence.) That's right. . . . Let's be silent, and let's wait. . . . (A long and heavy silence.) Perhaps it's now . . . (In a low, humble voice) that my apotheosis is being prepared. . . . (Everybody is visibly expectant. Then, CARMEN enters, as if furtively, by the left door. THE ENVOY is the first to see her. He silently indicates her presence to THE QUEEN. THE QUEEN motions to CARMEN to withdraw, but CARMEN nevertheless takes a step forward.)
THE QUEEN 
I gave orders that we were not to be disturbed. What do you want?
CARMEN 
I tried to ring, but the apparatus is out of order. I beg your pardon. I'd like to speak with you.
THE QUEEN 
Well, what is it? Speak up!
CARMEN 
It's . . . I don't know. . . .
THE QUEEN 
Well, when at Court do as the Court does. Let's speak in an undertone. (She conspicuously lends ear to CARMEN, who leans forward and murmurs a few words. THE QUEEN seems very upset.)
THE QUEEN 
Are you sure?
CARMEN 
Quite, Madame.
THE ENVOY 
One does not follow Her Majesty.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
What's going on? Where's she going?
THE ENVOY 
To embroider. The Queen is embroidering, and she is not embroidering. . . . You know the refrain? The Queen attains her reality when she withdraws, absents herself, or dies.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
What's happening outside? (To the Judge) Do you have any news?
THE JUDGE 
What you call outside is as mysterious to us as we are to it.
THE BISHOP 
I shall try to depict the grief of this people which thought it had liberated itself by rebelling. Alas—or rather, thank Heaven!—there will never be a movement powerful enough to destroy our imagery.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
So you think I have a chance?
THE BISHOP
You're in the best possible position. There's consternation everywhere, in all families, in all institutions. People have trembled so violently that your image is beginning to make them doubt themselves.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Am I their only hope?
THE BISHOP 
Their only hope lies in utter collapse.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
In short, I'm like a pool in which they behold themselves?
THE GENERAL 
And if they lean over too far, they fall in and drown. Before long, you'll be full of drowned bodies! (No one seems to share his merriment.) Oh well . . . they're not yet at the brink!
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
So you really think the people had a wild hope? And that in losing all hope they lose everything? And that in losing everything they'll come and lose themselves in me? . . .
THE BISHOP 
That may very well happen. But, believe me, not if we can help it.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
When I am offered that final consecration. . . .
THE ENVOY 
For you, but for you alone, for a second the Earth will stop rotating. . . .
THE QUEEN 
George! (She falls into the arms of the Chief of Police.)
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
It's not true. (THE QUEEN nods yes.) But where? . . . When?
THE QUEEN 
There! . . . Now! The Studio. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
You're pulling my leg. I didn't hear anything.
THE QUEEN 
It was I who received him and ushered him into the Mausoleum Studio. The one that's being built in your honour. I left Carmen behind to attend to the preparations and I ran to let you know. I'm trembling like a leaf. . . .
THE BISHOP 
We're up the creek.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
The apparatus is working. You can see. . . .
THE ENVOY 
That is not the practice. It's filthy. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Where's the mechanism? (To the Queen) Let's watch together. (She stands at the left, facing a small port-hole. After a brief hesitation, THE JUDGE, GENERAL and BISHOP place themselves at the right, at another port-hole symmetrical with the first. Then, the two panels of the double mirror forming the back of the stage silently draw apart, revealing the interior of the Special Studio. THE ENVOY, with resignation, joins the Chief of Police.)
DESCRIPTION OF THE MAUSOLEUM STUDIO 
The stones of the wall, which is circular, are visible. At the rear, a stairway that descends. In the centre of this well there seems to be another, in which the steps of a stairway are visible. On the walls, four laurel wreaths, adorned with crêpe. When the panels separate, ROGER is at the middle of the stairway, which he is descending. CARMEN seems to be guiding him. ROGER is dressed like THE CHIEF OF POLICE, though, mounted on the same cothurni as the Three Figures, he looks taller. His shoulders have also been broadened. He descends the stairs to the rhythm of a drum.
CARMEN 
It's on the house.
ROGER 
Thanks.
CARMEN 
That end's for the light.
ROGER
Yes. . . . (A pause.) I'm not asking for your advice.
CARMEN 
I beg your pardon, sir.
ROGER 
The slave?
CARMEN 
He's being untied.
ROGER 
He knows what it's about?
CARMEN 
Completely. You're the first. You're inaugurating this Studio, but, you know, the scenarios are all reducible to a major theme. . . .
ROGER 
Which is. . . ?
CARMEN 
Death.
ROGER 
And so this is my tomb?
CARMEN 
Mausoleum.
ROGER 
How many slaves are working on it?
CARMEN 
The entire people, sir. Half of the population during the day and the other half at night. As you have requested, the whole mountain will be burrowed and tunnelled. The interior will have the complexity of a termite nest or of the Basilica of Lourdes—we don't know yet. No one will be able to see anything from the outside. All they'll know is that the mountain is sacred, but, inside, the tombs are already being enshrined in tombs, the cenotaphs in cenotaphs, the coffins in coffins, the urns. . . .
ROGER 
What about here, where I am now?
CARMEN 
An antechamber. An antechamber called the Valley of the Fallen. (She mounts the underground stairway.) In a little while, you'll go farther down.
ROGER 
I'm not to hope to see the light of day again?
CARMEN 
But . . . do you still want to?
ROGER 
It's really true that no one's ever been here before me?
CARMEN 
In this . . . tomb, or in this . . . Studio?
ROGER 
Is everything really on right? My outfit? My toupet?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
He knew I wear a toupet?
THE BISHOP 
He's the only one who doesn't know that everyone knows it.
CARMEN 
Everything was carefully planned long ago. It's all been worked out. The rest is up to you.
ROGER 
You realize I'm feeling my way too. I've got to imagine what the Hero's like, and he's never shown himself much.
CARMEN 
That's why we've taken you to the Mausoleum Studio. It's not possible to make many errors here, nor indulge your imagination.
ROGER 
Will I be alone?
CARMEN 
Everything is padded. The doors are lined. So are the walls.
ROGER 
What about . . . the mausoleum?
CARMEN 
Built into the rock. The proof is that there's water oozing from the walls. Deathly silent. As for light, the darkness is so thick that your eyes have developed astounding qualities. The cold? Yes, the coldness of death. It's been a gigantic job drilling through the mountain. Men are still groaning in order to hollow out a gigantic niche for you. Everything proves that you're loved and that you're a conqueror.
ROGER 
Groaning? Could . . . could I hear the groaning?
CARMEN 
Come here!
ROGER 
Is that it?
CARMEN 
A fine specimen, isn't he? Skinny. With lice and sores. He dreams of dying for you. I'll leave you alone now.
ROGER 
With him? No, no. (A pause.) Stay. Everything always takes place in the presence of a woman. It's in order for a woman's face to be a witness that, usually. . . .
CARMEN 
As I've told you, everything's padded, but some sounds always manage to filter through. Does it bother you? Life's starting up again little by little . . . as before. . . .
ROGER 
Yes, as before. . . .
CARMEN 
You were. . . .
ROGER 
Yes. Everything's washed up. . . . And what's saddest of all is people's saying
CARMEN 
You mustn't think about it any more. And you must stop listening to the sounds from outside. Besides, it's raining. The whole mountain has been swept by a tornado. (Stage voice) You are at home here. (Pointing to the slave) Make him talk.
ROGER 
For you can talk? And what else can you do?
THE SLAVE 
First, bow; then, shrink into myself a little more (He takes Roger's foot and places it on his own back.) like this! . . . and even. . . .
ROGER 
Yes . . . and even?
THE SLAVE 
Sink into the earth, if it's possible.
ROGER 
Sink in, really? But there's no mud?
THE QUEEN 
He's right. We should have provided mud. In a well-run house. . . . But it's opening day, and he's the first client to use the Studio. . . .
THE SLAVE 
I feel it all over my body, sir. It's all over me, except in my mouth, which is open so that I can sing your praises and utter the groans that made me famous.
ROGER 
Famous? You're famous, you?
THE SLAVE 
Famous for my chants, sir, which are hymns to your glory.
ROGER 
So your glory accompanies mine? (To Carmen) Does he mean that my reputation will be kept going by his words? And . . . if he says nothing, I'll cease to exist. . . ?
CARMEN 
I'd like very much to satisfy you, but you ask questions that aren't in the scenario.
ROGER 
But what about you, who sings to you?
THE SLAVE 
Nobody. I'm dying.
ROGER 
But without me, without my sweat, without my tears and blood, what would you be?
THE SLAVE 
Nothing.
ROGER 
You sing? But what else do you do?
THE SLAVE 
We do all we possibly can to be more and more unworthy of you.
ROGER 
What, for example?
THE SLAVE 
We try hard just to stand and rot. And, believe me, it's not always easy. Life tries to prevail. . . . But we stand our ground. We keep shrinking more and more every. . . .
ROGER 
Day?
THE SLAVE 
Week.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
That's not much. With a little effort. . . .
THE ENVOY 
Be still. Let them play out their roles.
ROGER 
That's not much. With a little effort. . . .
THE SLAVE 
With joy, Your Excellency! You're so splendid! So splendid that I wonder whether you're aglow or whether you're all the darkness of all the nights?
ROGER 
What does it matter, since I'm no longer to have any reality except in the reality of your phrases.
THE SLAVE 
You have not mouth nor ears nor eyes, but all of you is a thundering mouth and at the same time a dazzling and watchful eye. . . .
ROGER 
You see it, but do the others know it? Does the night know it? Does death? Do the stones? What do the stones say?
THE SLAVE 
The stones say. . . .
ROGER 
Well, I'm listening.
THE SLAVE 
The cement that holds us together to form your tomb. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
The stones venerate me!
THE SLAVE 
. . . the cement is moulded of tears, spit and blood. The workers’ eyes and hands that rested upon us have matted us with grief. We are yours, and only yours. (THE SLAVE starts crawling up the stairs again.)
ROGER 
Everything proclaims me! Everything breathes me and everything worships me! My history was lived so that a glorious page might be written and then read. It's reading that counts. (He suddenly notices that the Slave has disappeared. To Carmen) But. . . where's he going? . . . Where is he? . . .
CARMEN 
He's gone off to sing. He's going up into the light of day. He'll tell. . . that he carried your footsteps . . . and that. . . .
ROGER 
Yes, and that? What else will he tell?
CARMEN 
The truth; that you're dead, or rather that you don't stop dying and that your image, like your name, reverberates to infinity.
ROGER 
He knows that my image is everywhere?
CARMEN 
Yes, everywhere, inscribed and engraved and imposed by fear.
ROGER 
In the palms of stevedores? In the games of children? On the teeth of soldiers? In war?
CARMEN 
Everywhere.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
So I've made it?
THE QUEEN 
Are you happy?
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
You've done a good job. That puts the finishing touch to your house.
ROGER 
Is it in prisons? In the wrinkles of old people?
CARMEN 
It is.
ROGER 
In the curves of roads?
CARMEN 
You mustn't ask the impossible.
ROGER 
Life is nearby . . . and far away. Here all the women are beautiful. Their purpose is purely ornamental. . . . One can lose oneself in them. . . .
CARMEN 
That's right. In ordinary language, we're called whores. But you've got to leave. . . .
ROGER 
And go where? Into life? To carry on, as they say, with my activities. . . .
CARMEN 
I don't know what you're doing, and I haven't the right to inquire. But you've got to leave. Your time's up.
ROGER 
They give you the rush in this place! Why do you want me to go back where I came from?
CARMEN 
You've nothing further to do. . . .
ROGER 
There? No. Nothing further. Nor here either. And outside, in what you call life, everything has crashed. No truth was possible. . . . Did you know Chantal?
CARMEN 
Get going! Clear out of here!
THE QUEEN 
I won't allow him to create a rumpus in my studios! Who was it who sent me that individual? Whenever there are disturbances, the riff-raff always crop up. I hope that Carmen. . . .
CARMEN 
Get out! You've no right to ask questions either. You know that brothels are very strictly regulated and that we're protected by the police.
ROGER 
No! Since I'm playing the Chief of Police and since you allow me to be here. . . .
CARMEN 
You're crazy! You wouldn't be the first who thought he'd risen to power. . . . Come along!
ROGER 
If the brothel exists and if I've a right to go there, then I've a right to lead the character I've chosen to the very limit of his destiny . . . no, of mine . . . of merging his destiny with mine. . . .
CARMEN 
Stop shouting, sir. All the studios are occupied. Come along. . . .
THE QUEEN 
On my rugs! On the new carpet! He's a lunatic!
CARMEN 
Doing that here! (She yells) Madame! Mme Irma! (CARMEN finally manages to drag Roger out.) (THE QUEEN rushes from the room. All the characters—the CHIEF OF POLICE, THE ENVOY, THE JUDGE, THE GENERAL, THE BISHOP—turn and leave the port-holes, THE CHIEF OF POLICE moves forward to the middle of the stage.)
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Well played. He thought he had me.
THE QUEEN 
George! The vestibule . . . the rugs are covered with blood . . . the vestibule's full of clients. . . . We're wiping up as best we can. . . . Carmen doesn't know where to put them. . . .
THE ENVOY 
Nice work.
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
An image of me will be perpetuated in secret. Mutilated? (He shrugs his shoulders.) Yet a low Mass will be said to my glory. Notify the kitchens! Have them send me enough grub for two thousand years.
THE QUEEN 
What about me? George, I'm alive!
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
So. . . . I'm. . . . Where? Here, or . . . a thousand times there? (He points to the tomb.) Now I can be kind . . . and pious . . . and just. . . . Did you see? Did you see me? There, just before, larger than large, stronger than strong, deader than dead? So I've nothing more to do with you.
THE QUEEN 
George! But I still love you!
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
I've won the right to go and sit and wait for two thousand years. (To the photographers) You! Watch me live, and die. For posterity
THE QUEEN 
But it was I who did everything, who organized everything. . . . Stay. . . . What will. . . .
THE CHIEF OF POLICE 
Think of me!
THE JUDGE 
Don't leave us alone!
THE GENERAL 
That carriage again!
THE ENVOY 
Be careful, you'll get your fingers caught.
THE QUEEN 
Gentlemen, you are free.
THE BISHOP 
But . . . in the middle of the night?
THE QUEEN 
You'll leave by the narrow door that leads into the alley. There's a car waiting for you. (She nods courteously. The Three Figures exeunt right. A fourth burst of machine-gun fire.)
THE ENVOY 
Someone dreaming, Madame. . . .
THE QUEEN 
. . . Irma.. . . Call me Mme Irma and go home. Good night, sir.
THE ENVOY 
Good night, Mme Irma.
IRMA 
It took so much light. . . two pounds’ worth of electricity a day! Thirty-eight studios! Every one of them gilded, and all of them rigged with machinery so as to be able to fit into and combine with each other. . . . And all these performances so that I can remain alone, mistress and assistant mistress of this house and of myself. (She pushes in a button, then pushes it out again.) Oh no, that's the tomb. He needs light, for two thousand years! . . . and food for two thousand years. . . (She shrugs her shoulders.) Oh well, everything's in working order, and dishes have been prepared. Glory means descending into the grave with tons of victuals! . . . (She calls out, facing the wings
