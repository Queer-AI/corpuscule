HOSPICE WORKER
Mother Superior always used to say, "Watch out for the religious cranks, Sister Veronica." When I started working for the hospice I had a touch of the crank about me. I think maybe that's why they gave me the old heave-ho from the convent. But I've kept my vow of chastity and I've made a pilgrimage to Lourdes.

My job is to ease the way for those who are dying. I've done this for the last couple of years. I work mainly here at St˙ Vincent's. During the day I have a boring secretarial job, which is how I support my career as a saint.

I was much more idealistic when I started. I had just left the convent. I guess I thought working with the dying would give me spiritual gold stars. I thought I'd be able to impart my great wisdom to those in need of improvement. I wanted to bear witness to dramatic deathbed conversions, see shafts of light emanating from heaven, multicolored auras hovering above the heads of those in the process of expiring. I always imagined they would go out expressing their gratitude for all I had done.

A quick joke:

Did you hear about the man who lost his left side? ... He's all right now. All right now.

We tell a lot of jokes in my line of work.

RICH
You take Henry.

SAUL
Cut him in half.

RICH
You can keep him.

SAUL
What are we going to do about him?

RICH
I said he's yours.

SAUL
You found him.

RICH
I don't want him.

SAUL
Chet doesn't like cats?

RICH
I knew this would happen. Don't start in.

SAUL
We gotta get things settled.

RICH
Then let's. How 'bout if we simplify things: sell everything and split the cash.

SAUL
Even the cobalt glass?

RICH
Yes.

SAUL
And Aunt Billie's hooked rug? Say, how's she doing?

RICH
She's on medication. Sell the rug.

SAUL
I will not sell the manikin heads. I don't care what you say.

RICH
Then take them.

SAUL
And the chromium lamp? I love that lamp.

RICH
Take it.

SAUL
And the Barcelona chair?

RICH
The Barcelona chair is mine!

(Beat)

Fuck it. Take it. Take everything. I won't be Jewish about it.

(He rises to go)

SAUL
Why didn't you warn me we were going to play Christians and Jews today? I would have worn my yellow star.

RICH
I've gotta go.

("RICH is leaving)

SAUL
Where're you going?

RICH
I'm not feeling so hot. Let's make it another day.

SAUL
(Blocking his way)

Sit down.

RICH
(Pushing his hand away)

Don't push me.

SAUL
Sorry. I don't like this any more than you, but we gotta do it. It's been six months.

(He lightens things up)

A divorce is not final until the property settlement.

RICH
Saul ...?

(He's about to say something important)

SAUL
What, Rich?

(He waits expectantly)

What?

RICH
Never mind.

SAUL
What? ... What? ... You always do that!

RICH
I want the chair.

SAUL
You can have the fucking Barcelona chair if Chet wants it so bad! ... What about the paintings? Do you want to sell the Paul Cadmus?

RICH
Yes.

SAUL
You love the Cadmus.

(Silence)

And who's going to buy the Burgess drawings? Did you hear that Kenny had a heart attack?

RICH
We'll donate them to the Met.

SAUL
Just what they always wanted: the world's largest collection of Magic Marker hustler portraits.

(RICH nods)

RICH
They're yours.

SAUL
But you commissioned them. We'll split them up: I get the blonds and you get the blacks --or vice versa.

RICH
All yours.

SAUL
Then you get the Mickey Mouse collection.

RICH
Sell it.

SAUL
You don't sell collectibles. Not right now. What's with this money mania? Between the book and the catering, I thought you were doing well.

RICH
I want to build a swimming pool.

SAUL
You don't swim.

RICH
I want a Mercedes.

SAUL
You don't drive. It's Chet--he'll bankrupt you!

(Beat)

I don't believe I said that ...

(He speaks sincerely)

Your book is beautiful.

RICH
I never thanked you for the cover photograph.

SAUL
(Shrugging off the compliment)

How's it selling?

RICH
Not bad--for short stories. Everyone mentions your photo. Ed White said--

SAUL
Your book is terrific. Really.

RICH
I'm glad you like it.

SAUL
One minor thing.

RICH
What's that?

SAUL
I thought the dedication was a bit much.

RICH
Why are you doing this?

SAUL
Don't you think quoting Cavafy in Greek is a little coy?

RICH
Please!

SAUL
Why didn't you just say, "To Chet, whose beautiful buns inspired these tales"?

RICH
Jesus!

SAUL
I'm sorry!

(Silence)

RICH
I sold the Krugerrands. You were right about them. You have always been right about money.

(He hands SAUL a check)

This includes the thousand I borrowed for the periodontist.

SAUL
You sure?

RICH
Take it.

SAUL
I'm not desperate for it.

RICH
It's yours.

SAUL
I don't want it.

RICH
Damn it!

SAUL
(Taking the check)

Okay.

RICH
That makes us even now.

SAUL
(Examining the check)

Clouds and trees.

RICH
Let's get on with this.

SAUL
Is he waiting for you downstairs? You could have told him to come up.

RICH
Shit. No! Can it.

(Beat)

I won't be wanting the copper pots.

SAUL
Why not? When you and Chet move to your space you'll want to cook again.

RICH
I just don't want them! People change.

(Silence)

I'm eating out a lot.

SAUL
Chet can't cook?

RICH
(Deciding not to respond with a bitchy comment)

You keep the rowing machine.

SAUL
Have you lost weight?

RICH
And the trampoline.

SAUL
There's some Black Forest cake in the fridge.

(SAUL goes toward the kitchen to get the cake)

RICH
Stop it.

SAUL
Stop what?

RICH
Just stop.

SAUL
I can't.

RICH
We're almost through.

SAUL
I have feelings.

RICH
You have only one feeling.

SAUL
He won't make you happy.

RICH
Here we go again.

(RICH gets up to go)

SAUL
Don't!

RICH
Keep everything.

SAUL
I'm not myself.

RICH
Nothing is worth this.

SAUL
I've been upset.

RICH
I mean it.

SAUL
Don't go. Please.

(RICH sits. There is a long pause)

I visited Teddy today at St˙ Vincent's. It's very depressing ... He's lying there in bed, out of it. He's been out of it since the time we saw him. He's not in any pain, snorting his imaginary cocaine, doing his poppers. Sometimes he's washing his mother's floor, and he's speaking to her in Spanish. Sometimes he's having sex. You can see him having sex right in front of you. He doesn't even know you're there.

(Pause. Both men look down at their feet)

Jimmy died, as you must have heard. I went out to San Francisco to be with him the last few weeks. You must have heard that, too. He was in a coma for a month. Everybody wanted to pull the plug, but they were afraid of legal complications. I held his hand. He couldn't talk, but I could see his eyelids flutter. I swear he knew I was with him.

(Pause)

Harry has K˙S˙, and Matt has the swollen glands. He went in for tests today ... I haven't slept well for weeks. Every morning I examine my body for swellings, marks. I'm terrified of every pimple, every rash. If I cough I think of Teddy. I wish he would die. He is dead. He might as well be. Why can't he die? I feel the disease closing in on me. All my activities are life

and death. Keep up my Blue Cross. Up my reps. Eat my vegetables.

Sometimes I'm so scared I go back on my resolutions: I drink too much, and I smoke a joint, and I find myself at the bars and clubs, where I stand around and watch. They remind me of accounts of Europe during the Black Plague: coupling in the dark, dancing till you drop. The New Wave is the corpse look. I'm very frightened and I miss you. Say something, damn it.

(Beat)

RICH
I have it.

(Immediately, the lights come up on the left side of the stage)

CHET
(A handsome, boyish man in his early twenties)

You what?

LILY
(A beautiful woman, thirtyish)

You have what?

BROTHER
(To his wife, whom we don't see)

He has AIDS.

SAUL
I don't think that's funny.

BUSINESS PARTNER
The idea is ridiculous.

RICH
That's the bad news.

BUSINESS PARTNER
You ran the goddamned marathon.

LILY
Darling!

RICH
The good news is that I have only the swollen glands.

(Two doctors in white gowns appear)

DOCTOR 1
We call it a "Pre-AIDS Condition."

DOCTOR 2
"AIDS-related Complex."

RICH
And I've lost some weight.

SAUL
I'm in a state of shock.

LILY
Move in with me.

Chet doesn't know how to take care of you.

RICH
I tire easily.

My temperature goes up and down.

DOCTOR 1
Your suppressor cells outnumber your helper cells.

BROTHER
I don't care what he has, Betty, he's my brother.

CHET
You're my lover.

LILY
You're my buddy.

BUSINESS PARTNER
Rich and I started the business about a year ago. But now word got out that Rich has

this disease. I tried to explain:

he doesn't touch the food; I do all the cooking. But they won't listen.

BROTHER
I'm not in the habit of kissing my brother. I touched him on the back when I arrived and when I left.

BUSINESS PARTNER
Why would they? I wonder if I'd use a caterer who had AIDS.

SAUL
Doctors make mistakes all the time.

DOCTOR 2
There are a number of highly experimental treatments.

DOCTOR 1
Of highly experimental treatments.

CHET
If you don't mind, I'll sleep on the couch tonight. You've been sweating a lot.

LILY
I can't turn it down. The work is shit, and who wants to tour Canada in January, but they're paying me a fortune.

BROTHER
When he offered me a cup of coffee I told him I'd have a can of beer.

LILY
I'll be back in four weeks.

BUSINESS PARTNER
I can understand what he's going through. Myself, I've been wrestling with cancer for a while.

SAUL
Remember when they told my niece she had skin cancer?

It turned out to be dry skin.

I'm winning.

CHET
I hope you don't mind, but I'll use the red soap dish and you'll use the blue.

RICH
Christ! I've been putting the blocks to you nightly for months and now you're worried about sharing the fucking soap dish?

BUSINESS PARTNER
I wonder if it's safe to use the same telephone, or whether I'm being paranoid.

BROTHER
Christ, I didn't even use the bathroom, even though I had to take a leak so bad I could taste it. Now, that's paranoid.

CHET
I know I'm being paranoid.

LILY
They're flying me out to the Coast. I hate that place.

RICH
Chet, you've been out every night this week. Do you have to go out again?

BROTHER
I know you're scared, Betty, but I will not tell my own brother he's not welcome in my house.

CHET
Need something from outside?

BROTHER
He's spent every Christmas with us since we got married, and this year will be no exception.

RICH
Forget I said anything: just don't wake me up when you get in.

BROTHER
You're forcing me to choose between you and my brother.

CHET
See you later.

LILY
I've been dating this guy-can you imagine me dating? Well, he's very nice, and he's got a lot of money, and he's not impressed with my life in the theater-and that's why I haven't been up to see you. Rich?

CHET
You know I'd do anything for you.

RICH
You're walking out on me.

BROTHER
We're going to Betty's mother for Christmas.

CHET
I need more space to get my head together.

SAUL
What did you expect?

RICH
Chet, please, I need you!

(RICH tries to put his arms around CHET. Everyone except SAUL pulls back terrified)

CHET, BROTHER, LILY, PARTNERAND DOCTORS
Don't touch me!

(Beat)

LILY
Please forgive me!

CHET
This thing has me blown away.

BROTHER
If it weren't for the kids.

BUSINESS PARTNER
I don't know what the hell we're going to do.

SAUL
Bastards!

(CHET, BROTHER, PARTNER, LILY put on white gowns and become doctors)

RICH
(To DOCTOR 1 )

Doctor, tell me the truth. What are my chances?

DOCTOR 1
I don't know.

RICH
(To DOCTOR 2 )

Doctor, tell me the truth. What are my chances?

DOCTOR 2
I don't know.

RICH
(To DOCTOR 3 )

What are my chances?

DOCTOR 3
I just don't know.

RICH
(To DOCTORS 4 and 5 )

Am I going to make it, doctors, yes or no?!

DOCTORS 4 AND 5
I'm sorry, we just don't know.

SAUL
Rich?

TV ANNOUNCER
(Prerecorded)

The simple fact is that we know very little about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. Its victims may live a normal life span, or they may have only a few weeks. Fortunately, so far this tragic disease has not spread outside its target groups to people like you and me. When will science conquer this dreaded plague? We don't know. We don't know. We simply don't know. Don't know ...

DOCTORS
We don't know.

SAUL
And for three months you kept this from me.

(The DOCTORS exit. We're back in SAUL' s apartment)

RICH
I don't want your pity.

SAUL
You're my friend. You'll stay with me till you feel better.

RICH
Aren't you afraid I'll infect you?

SAUL
Yes, I'm afraid.

RICH
Paper plates, Lysol, face masks--no, I'd prefer to live alone, thank you.

SAUL
You need me.

RICH
Besides, if I live with you, where am I going to bring my tricks?

SAUL
You pick up people?

RICH
(Standing at the bar)

I go to bars... I pick up guys ... but I give them a medical report before we leave ...

(Without a pause, we're in a bar. RICH is talking to a stranger)

I should tell you something.

PICKUP 1
You like something kinky. Whips? Golden showers? Fist?

RICH
It's not like that.

PICKUP 1
I once picked up a guy liked to be yelled at in German. The only German I know is the "Ode to Joy" from Beethoven's Ninth.

(He yells like an enraged Nazi)

"O Freude, schöner Götterfunken, Schweinehund, Tochter aus Elysium, Dummkopf!"

RICH
I have a very mild case of lymphadenopathy.

PICKUP 1
What's that?

RICH
An AIDS-related condition.

PICKUP 1
Oh, shit.

RICH
Just the swollen glands--

PICKUP 1
No way. Uh-uh ... Good luck ... Oh, man ...

(PICKUP 1 exits. We're back with RICH and SAUL )

RICH
So I stopped telling them.

SAUL
You mean you take them home and don't tell them?

RICH
We do it there in the bar.

SAUL
How can you?

RICH
I lurk in dark corners where they can't see my lumps. I'm like a shark or a barracuda, and I snap them up and infect them.

SAUL
How can you joke about this?

RICH
I don't care. I'm going to die! I'll take as many as I can with me. And I've pissed in the Croton Reservoir. I'm going to infect the whole fucking city! Wheeeee!

SAUL
No fucking around, give me a straight answer. Do you still pick up people?

RICH
Maybe I ought to wear a sign around my neck and ring a bell: "AIDS, I've got AIDS, stand clear!" Would that make you happy? Or maybe I should dig a hole in the ground, douse myself with kerosene, and have a final cigarette. No muss, no fuss. Is that what you want?

SAUL
Forgive me for not trusting you. It's just that I'm frightened of it. I don't know what I'm saying half the time.

RICH
How the fuck do you think I feel? My lover leaves me; my family won't let me near them; I lose my business; I can't pay my rent. How the fuck do you think I feel?

SAUL
You'll stay here with me.

RICH
Till death do us part.

SAUL
I love you.

RICH
I don't want your love!

SAUL
Take what you can ... [get]! I didn't mean that. I love you. I always have. You have nowhere to go. You've got to stay with me.

RICH
Shit shit shit.

SAUL
You were kidding about picking up people.

RICH
What do you think? What would you do in my place?

SAUL
I wouldn't... I'd ... Therapy! ... I don't know what I'd do.

(We're back in the bar)

PICKUP 2
Jesus, I've told you all about myself. I've really spilled my guts to you. I needed to do that. Maybe I shouldn't say this, but, Christ, you know something? I like you very much. Even though you are a writer ... Would you like to come home with me?

RICH
I'd like to very much ...

(He checks his watch)

but I have an appointment.

PICKUP 2
Then tomorrow, how about tomorrow? I don't want to lose track of you. I don't

know when I've had such a good time. I can talk to you.

RICH
I've enjoyed myself, too.

PICKUP 2
Then maybe we'll have dinner, maybe go to the movies. Do you like movies? There's an Alfred Hitchcock festival at the Regency. Or maybe we could see the new Charles Ludlam--

RICH
Thanks, but I have to tell you something. I have--

PICKUP 2
You have a lover. I knew it. You're too nice to be unattached.

RICH
I have ... I have ... I have a lover.

(We're back with SAUL )

SAUL
You have a lover.

RICH
I don't even know where he is.

SAUL
I don't mean Chet. I mean me.

(RICH turns away. He's back in the bar with another stranger, CLONE 1, who is wearing a leather jacket and reflecting aviator glasses. SAUL continues to plead to RICH' S back)

What about me?

(RICH tries in vain to get CLONE 1' s attention)

RICH
Pardon me.

SAUL
What about me?

RICH
Yo. Yoo-hoo. Hello.

SAUL
What about me?!

RICH
(To CLONE 1)

What about me?!

CLONE
What about you?

RICH
I'm a very interesting guy. You look like a very interesting guy. Let's talk. And if you don't want to talk, let's go back there and let's ...

(RICH stares CLONE 1 straight in the face)

I'll do anything you want. Anything.

CLONE
I want you to move about three feet over to the left. Can't you see I'm cruising that dude over there?

(We notice for the first time an identically dressed man standing across the room)

RICH
Well, fuck you.

CLONE
What's that, buddy?

(RICH turns his back on CLONE 1 and starts talking loudly to the BARTENDER )

RICH
Gimme a Jack Daniels straight up-no ice --make it a double, and a Heinekens chaser.

BARTENDER
Double Jack up, Heinie back.

(CLONE 2 has moseyed on over to CLONE 1. They stand side by side, facing the

audience, feigning indifference to each other)

CLONE 2
Your name Chip?

RICH
No ice!

BARTENDER
No ice.

CLONE
Chuck.

RICH
Hate ice.

CLONE 2
(Extending his hand)

Chad.

(The CLONES shake hands)

RICH
(To the BARTENDER)

Put 'er there, Chet --I mean Chump. You come here often?

(He downs the shot and beer as quickly as he can)

CLONE 2
Thought you were this guy Chip I met here on Jockstrap Night.

CLONE
Haven't been here since the Slave Auction.

CLONE 2
Look familiar.

(With synchronized actions the CLONES turn to look at each other, then turn away)

CLONE
Go to the Saint?

CLONE 2
Been there.

RICH
(To the BARTENDER)

Quiet for a Friday...

CLONE
I know where.

RICH
Not much action.

CLONE 2
St˙ Mark's?

RICH
(Offering his glass)

Same ...

CLONE
Nah.

RICH
Probably's this disease thing.

CLONE
Everard. Ever go there?

CLONE 2
Stopped going since this disease thing.

CLONE
Gotta be real careful.

RICH
Ask me, the whole thing's exaggerated. No one knows for sure how it's spread.

CLONE 2
Right. Doctor gave me a clean bill of health yesterday.

CLONE
Can you prove it?

(He punches CLONE 2 on the arm)

Kidding.

CLONE 2
Gotta be real careful. Run six miles a day.

RICH
My philosophy is: you've got it, you've got it. Nothing you can do about it.

(He offers his glass)

Same.

CLONE
(Tweeking CLONE 2' s nipple)

So what're you up for?

CLONE 2
Come right to the point, don't you?

(The CLONES perform a macho mating ritual of arm wrestling, punching, and ass grabbing to determine who is the "top man ")

RICH
Poor bastards that got it: cancer, pneumonia, herpes all over. I mean, I'd kill myself if I had to go through all that shit. Get a gun and perform fellatio on it ...

CLONE 2
What're you up for, Daddy?

RICH
Slash my wrists with the grain ...

CLONE
Me top.

RICH
Subway tracks?

CLONE
Got some beautiful ...

(He snorts deeply to indicate cocaine)

CLONE 2
Ever do opium?

CLONE
I have a water pipe. We'll smoke it through some Southern Comfort.

RICH
Or maybe I'd mix myself a Judy Garland: forty reds and a quart of vodka.

(He hands his glass to the BARTENDER )

Fuck the beer!

CLONE
We're roommates now. What about you?

RICH
(The ecstatic drunken poet)

"Glory be to God for dappled things ..."

CLONE 2
I'm free, white, and twenty-four.

RICH
"For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow ..."

SAUL
I know it sounds stupid, but take care of your health.

RICH
"For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim ..."

CLONE 2
In bed, I mean.

RICH
I don't care what anybody says, I believe that somewhere, you know, deep down ...

(He holds out his glass)

CLONE
I'll do anything you want.

RICH
Beyond all this incredible pain and confusion, anxiety, fear, terror ...

(He holds out his glass)

BARTENDER
No ice.

CLONE 2
Anything?

RICH
I believe that there might be ...

(He searches for words to describe the Supreme Being)

that there could be ... that there is--

CLONE
Anything.

SAUL
You're drinking too much.

RICH
I believe in a perfect ...

(RICH is having a booze-fueled vision of the Godhead)

CLONE 2
Mirrors ...

RICH
Shining ...

CLONE
Chains ...

RICH
Powerful ...

SAUL
Vitamins ...

RICH
Pure ...

(A third CLONE appears)

CLONE 3
Rubber ...

CLONE
Dildo ...

SAUL
Diet ...

RICH
Free ...

CLONE 2
Dungeon ...

SAUL
Acupuncture ...

RICH
Truthful ...

CLONE 3
Ten inches ...

SAUL
Interferon ...

RICH
Beautiful ...

CLONE 3
(Approaching the bar, to the BARTENDER)

Beer!

(CLONE 3 accidentally spills beer on RICH )

CLONE 2
Watersports.

RICH
(Raging drunkenly)

Asshole!

CLONE
Hey!

RICH
I'll kill ya, faggot!

SAUL
(Intervening)

Hey!... He's been drinking.

BARTENDER
Get that jerk outta here!

RICH
What's a matter, can't you fight like a man?

SAUL
(Gently but firmly)

Rich.

RICH
Fuck all that shit!

SAUL
Rich.

RICH
Let Him cure me!

SAUL
(Trying to distract him)

Did you hear the one about the faggot, the black, and the Jew?

RICH
(Shaking his fist, to God in the sky)

You hear me, motherfucker?

SAUL
How did that go?

RICH
Cure me!

(They are out on the street by now)

SAUL
C'mon, keep moving.

RICH
I'm a very bad person.

SAUL
You're an asshole.

RICH
I wanted to go to bed with that guy.

SAUL
I practically beg you to move in--

RICH
I wasn't going to tell him about me or anything.

SAUL
And what do you do?

RICH
But you want to know something?

SAUL
You disappear for two weeks.

RICH
I wouldn't do that. I would never do that.

SAUL
I almost called the cops.

RICH
You believe me?

SAUL
Believe what?

RICH
I never never never would ever do that.

SAUL
Do you remember the one about the Polish Lesbian?

RICH
Never.

SAUL
She liked men.

(The joke pretty much sobers RICH up)

RICH
You asshole.

SAUL
You schmuck.

RICH
You prick.

SAUL
God, I miss talking dirty.

RICH
Talking dirty makes it feel like spring.

(He is the superstud)

Suck my dick, faggot.

SAUL
(Superstud)

Kiss my ass, cocksucker.

RICH
Sit on it, punk.

SAUL
Lick boot, fruit.

RICH
God, how I love sleaze: the whining selfpity of a rainy Monday night in a leather bar in

early spring; five o'clock in the morning in the Mineshaft, with the bathtubs full of men dying to get pissed on and whipped; a subway John full of horny high school students; Morocco--getting raped on a tombstone in Marrakesh. God, how I miss it.

SAUL
I miss my filthy old ripped-up, patched button-fly jeans that I sun-bleached on myself our first weekend on the Island. Remember? It was Labor Day--

RICH
Memorial Day.

SAUL
And we did blotter acid. Remember acid before they put the speed in it? And we drank muscadet when we got thirsty.

RICH
Which we did a lot.

SAUL
Remember?

RICH
Remember Sunday afternoons blitzed on beer?

SAUL
And suddenly it's Sunday night and you're getting fucked in the second-floor window of the Hotel Christopher and you're being cheered on by a mob of hundreds of men.

RICH
And suddenly it's Friday a week later, and he's moved in, sleeping next to you, and you want him to go because you've met his brother Rod or Lance--

SAUL
(Practically sighing)

Miles.

RICH
--late of the merchant marines, who's even humpier.

SAUL
Orgies at the baths--

RICH
Afternoons at the Columbus Avenue bookstore.

(They are in the back room of a gay porno shop, or "bookstore." They play their favorite bookstore habitués)

RICH
More! Give it to me!

SAUL
Give it to you? Give it to me! Get out of my way, he's mine!

RICH
No, he's mine! Keep your hands off my wallet!

SAUL
(A black queen)

Sistuhs, theyuh's plenty heah fo' ivrybody.

RICH
(A tough New York queen)

Hey, Mary, the line forms at the rear.

SAUL
And whose rear might that be, sugar?

(Two other men appear in the bookstore)

MARTY
Hey, Vinnie?

VINNIE
Marty?

MARTY
What are you doing here? You said you were gonna buy the papers.

VINNIE
You said you were gonna walk the dogs.

MARTY
You trash!

(They exit, bickering)

SAUL
I always knew when you were fucking around.

RICH
You did your share.

SAUL
Moi?

RICH
I know why Grand Union wouldn't deliver to our house.

(They have returned to the loft)

SAUL
God, I used to love promiscuous sex.

RICH
Not "promiscuous," Saul, nondirective, noncommitted, nonauthoritarian--

SAUL
Free, wild, rampant--

RICH
Hot, sweaty, steamy, smelly--

SAUL
Juicy, funky, hunky--

RICH
Sex.

SAUL
Sex. God, I miss it.

(RICH lowers his eyes. SAUL nods and goes

to RICH. He takes RICH' s face in both hands and tries to kiss him square on the mouth. RICH pulls away frantically)

RICH
NO!

SAUL
I don't care!

RICH
You don't know what you're doing!

SAUL
It's my decision!

RICH
(Shaking his head)

No. Uh-uh. NO!

(SAUL sits on the sofa. RICH tries to take SAUL' s hand, but SAUL pulls it away. Beat)

The best times for me were going out with you on shoots.

SAUL
I thought you found them boring.

RICH
I enjoyed them.

SAUL
I was always afraid of boring you.

RICH
Remember staying up all night shooting the harvest moon at Jake's place?

SAUL
My fingers got so cold I could barely change film.

RICH
It was almost as bright as daylight. Remember the apple tree stuck out in the middle of the pasture, how the moonlight drained it of color?

SAUL
I remember the smell of the blanket we took from the barn.

RICH
Remember, I bet you I could find five constellations?

SAUL
You found six ... I never wanted us to break up.

RICH
Passive aggression.

SAUL
I wanted things to always remain the same. I'm still like that. I even like eating the same things day after day.

RICH
Pork chops, French fries--

SAUL
No change. I used to love our routine together. I'd go to work and then you'd be there when I got home, writing--

RICH
Drinking.

SAUL
I'd do this and you'd do that, and then we'd ...

(He makes a graceful gesture to indicate making love)

for a while--while Mission Impossible'd be on low in the background.

RICH
And then Star Trek.

SAUL
I never got tired of the same--

RICH
We were stagnating.

SAUL
--day after day the same, so we'd have a structure to fall back on when life dealt us its wild cards or curve balls. I want to be just half awake, like at the seashore, watching the waves roll in late in the afternoon, hypnotized by the glare of the sun, smelling the sea breeze and suntan lotion.

(Beat)

Mom is what? She's lying there next to Dad on the Navaho blanket, with white gunk on her nose, and my baby sister has finally stopped screaming and is sucking on the ear of her dollie. And Aunt Ellie--the one who said she thought I had good taste when she met you--is snoring next to husband number three. Her bazooms are going up and down, up and down, almost popping out of her bathing suit. It's so peaceful.

(Long pause)

I was at the St˙ Mark's baths soaking in the hot tub when I first heard about AIDS. It was four years ago. My friend Brian--remember him?-was soaking, too, and he told me about a mutual friend who had died the week before. It was "bizarre," he said ...

(A group enters, quietly talking)

1ST MAN
The first time I heard about AIDS it was a spring day, kind of warm. I was wearing a jacket. I remember I ran into a friend on the corner of Fifty-seventh and Broadway. He asked me if I'd heard about Joel. It didn't make any sense to me.

2ND MAN
The first time I heard about AIDS was in the Paradise Garage, a disco I used to go to. I won a raffle, the proceeds of which went to help people with this strange new disease. I didn't even know what it was.

3RD MAN
I thought AIDS was like Legionnaires' disease, or toxic shock syndrome, or sickle-cell anemia, Alzheimer's disease--one of those rare diseases you read about in the papers.

1ST WOMAN
It seemed so terribly remote at the time, like an ...

1ST WOMAN AND 2ND MAN
... epidemic in India ...

1ST WOMAN AND 2ND AND 3RD MAN
Finland ...

1ST WOMAN AND 1ST-3RD MAN
Borneo...

1ST AND 2ND WOMAN, 1ST-3RD MAN
Java ...

ALL
Ethiopia.

2ND WOMAN
The first time I heard about it...

1ST AND 2ND WOMAN
... I was standing in my kitchen ...

1ST WOMAN
... I was about to go out shopping...

1ST AND 2ND WOMAN
... for my youngest's birthday party.

4TH MAN
The phone rang.

2ND WOMAN
It was this doctor calling me ...

2ND WOMAN AND 3RD MAN
... about my son Bernard.

1ST WOMAN
He used all these words I can't pronounce ...

1ST AND 2ND WOMAN
... and then he said ...

1ST AND 4TH MAN
... "Do you understand what I've told you?"

2ND WOMAN
I said ...

1ST AND 2ND WOMAN
... Yes.

1ST WOMAN
Right before he hung up he said ...

1ST MAN
"So you know he has ..."

ALL
"... AIDS."

1ST WOMAN
That's the first time I heard the word.

2ND WOMAN
I was backstage at Saratoga.

2ND WOMAN AND 4TH MAN
I can't remember if it was The Seagull...

1ST WOMAN
... or Virginia Woolf.

2ND WOMAN
It was absurd. I had just seen him two weeks before. But there you had it ...

3RD MAN
When I first heard that Bill had AIDS and was dying, I thought...

2ND MAN
I almost died laughing.

1ST, 2ND, 4TH MAN, 1ST AND 2ND WOMAN
... George was dead.

(The group exits)

3RD MAN
... my God, we're all going to die.

SAUL
... and he told me about a mutual friend who had died the week before. It was "bizarre," he said. Brian died last week of the same thing. And he and I once soaked in the same hot tub, making a kind of human soup... That's all I ever wanted to do was relax.

(Long pause)

You'll stay with me. I won't bother you.

RICH
Just until I feel better.

SAUL
I understand: you're not coming back to be my lover.

RICH
Right. Is that okay?

SAUL
Schmuck.

(He mimics him)

Is that okay? Is that okay? It's okay! Asshole. Who the fuck wants you anyhow? And when I have guests stay the night, you disappear into your room. Right?

RICH
Right. Understood.

(Offhand)

You seeing somebody?

SAUL
I said when I have guests.

RICH
You planning an orgy?

SAUL
Just so we understand each other.

RICH
I should mention one thing.

SAUL
No, you do not have to spend Passover with the tribe.

RICH
I miss your father.

SAUL
Then go live with him. He likes you. The two of you could be very happy together.

RICH
One thing.

SAUL
He's never really liked me.

RICH
Saul.

SAUL
He's always been polite but--

RICH
Are you finished?

SAUL
No, I will not bring you coffee in bed. I only do that for lovers. Besides, I broke your blue mug.

RICH
Saul, please.

SAUL
On purpose.

RICH
One thing. I'm embarrassed. I'm just about broke. The doctors. Tests.

SAUL
I thought you were insured.

RICH
They're pulling a fast one.

SAUL
We'll sue. I'll call Craig. He'll know what--

RICH
Craig told me not to have high hopes.

SAUL
We'll get by. You'll see.

RICH
I'll keep track of every cent you spend on me. You'll get it all back when I can work. I swear.

SAUL
Not to worry, I'll take it out in trade.

RICH
Saul, I'm frightened!

(SAUL takes him in his arms)

SAUL
We'll be okay, we'll be okay ...

(They hold each other. LILY walks into the scene with CHET. She's dressed in evening wear and is carrying a number of accessories, including a mirror and a shawl. CHET is dressed in cutoffs and a sweatshirt. We are in a flashback)

LILY
Rich, congratulations! It's fantastic that they're going to publish your book.

(SAUL tries to break from the clinch, but RICH holds him back)

RICH
No autographs, please.

LILY
It's wonderful, it really is, but can you guys celebrate later?

SAUL
(To RICH)

Let me go.

(To CHET )

How do you do? I'm Saul.

LILY
Shit. Saul, Rich--my cousin Chet.

SAUL
(Trying to shake hands)

Hi, Chet.

(To RICH )

You're strangling me.

CHET
Hi.

RICH
(To SAUL)

It's your last chance to kiss the author before he becomes famous and goes straight.

SAUL
Straight to the baths.

(To CHET )

So how do you like New York?

CHET
I only got here yesterday. Lily's taking me to a show tonight.

RICH
Do you think success will change me?

SAUL
God, I hope so.

LILY
I know I'm being a pig, but I need head shots by six o'clock.

(She lowers a roller of colored background paper)

It's a dazzling role for me and

(To SAUL )

you're such an artist.

SAUL
Rich is the "artiste" in the family.

LILY
Chet, be an angel and bring Saul his camera. It's by the bar.

(CHET looks for the camera)

SAUL
(To CHET )

Don't let your cousin push you around the way she does me.

LILY
Come on, Saul, make click-click.

SAUL
Unless you like that sort of thing.

RICH
That's all I get?

LILY
(To RICH, about SAUL )

Leave the boy alone.

RICH
A hug and a bitchy remark?

SAUL
(To RlCH )

That and ninety cents.

RICH
(To SAUL)

No "Gee, Rich, I'm so proud of you"?

SAUL
(Smiling falsely)

Gee, Rich, I'm so proud of you.

RICH
I finally have some good news and he's annoyed.

CHET
(Holding the camera, to LILY)

What should I do with this?

SAUL
Well, your brother called, while you were out guzzling lunch with your agent, Dr˙ Mengele. Call him back.

RICH
What'd he have to say?

SAUL
Call him and ask him. I'm not your secretary.

RICH
(Imitating him)

I'm not your--

SAUL
He forgot my fucking name again. How long we been together?

RICH
Too long. Forget my brother. It's my first fucking book. Let's celebrate.

SAUL
You celebrate.

LILY
I'll throw a party.

RICH
What'll you serve, organic cabbage juice?

SAUL
(To LILY)

His brother's a scumbag.

RICH
He likes you, too.

CHET
(Still holding the camera, to SAUL)

Do you want this?

SAUL
(To CHET)

Thanks, Chuck.

CHET
Chet.

(SAUL accepts the camera from CHET but ignores the correction)

LILY
(Fondly, to RICH)

You're such a lush.

RICH
Whatever happened to my old drinking buddy?

LILY
Did you know they have gay A˙A˙ meetings?

(RICH makes a face)

SAUL
(To RICH, trying to be nice)

It's great news, babes, really.

RICH
You really don't give a fuck.

SAUL
Just how many copies you think a book of "fairy tales" will sell?

LILY
I picked a fine day to have my picture taken.

SAUL
If you only knew how much I love doing head shots.

RICH
(To SAUL)

Ah, fuck it, I guess I'm being childish.

SAUL
I shouldn't have said that. I'm thoughtless.

(RICH shrugs)

LILY
And I'm Sneezy. No, really, I'm selfish. But I want that role so bad. I play the ghost of Marie Antoinette.

(Throwing the scarf around her neck and taking a tits-and-ass pose, she speaks to SAUL )

How do you like this, hon? "Let them eat ..."

(She drops the pose immediately as SAUL starts to photograph her)

SAUL
Move your head a little to the ...

(She moves her head)

Good.

(SAUL snaps her)

RICH
(Going to living area, followed by CHET)

I'm going running.

(RICH changes into jogging clothes)

CHET
How far do you run?

RICH
Depends. I'm in training for the marathon.

CHET
The marathon! Hey, that's great. I run, too.

RICH
Oh, yeah?

(LILY and SAUL are busy taking pictures in the other side of the loft. They can see RICH and CHET, but they can't easily hear them)

LILY
How's this?

CHET
Congratulations on the book.

RICH
Thanks.

SAUL
That's right.

LILY
I forget the director's name. He's Lithuanian.

CHET
That poem of yours that Lily has hung up in her kitchen, I read it. I think it's great.

SAUL
Great.

RICH
You don't much look like the poetry type.

LILY
Bulgarian.

CHET
I'm not. I just love your poem.

RICH
Are you a student?

CHET
Just graduated from San Francisco State.

LILY
Everybody in the play is dead.

SAUL
Your cousin's hot. Is he gay?

LILY
I don't know. I'll ask him.

(She yells to CHET )

Chet, are you gay?

SAUL
Christ.

RICH
That's what I call tact.

LILY
Well?

CHET
(Loud, to LILY)

Yes.

LILY
Thanks, hon.

SAUL
Give us a little more cheek ...

CHET
There's a line of your poem I don't understand.

RICH
Only one? I have no idea what any of it means.

CHET
"The final waning moon..."

SAUL
Don't smile.

RICH
"And the coming of the light."

CHET
I love the way it sounds.

SAUL
Smile.

CHET
"The final waning moon / And the coming of the light."

SAUL
(Indicating to Lily that he wants a sexy pose)

He loves you.

CHET
Oh, I get it.

RICH
Lily tells me you're looking for a place to stay.

CHET
New York is so expensive.

SAUL
He lusts for you.

RICH
A friend of mine wants someone to take care of his loft while he's in L˙A˙

SAUL
He wants to ravage you.

CHET
I'll do it.

RICH
He has eight cats.

CHET
Eight tigers, I don't care.

LILY
I love that play.

RICH
It's in Tribeca.

SAUL
(Yelling to RICH)

I apologize about the book.

(RICH and CHET ignore SAUL )

CHET
Where's Tribeca?

SAUL
Did you hear me?

RICH
On the isle of Manhattan.

CHET
We're on the isle of Manhattan.

RICH
We are.

LILY
The main characters are all ghosts.

CHET
I know that.

SAUL
I'll throw him a party.

RICH
That's about all you have to know.

SAUL
A big bash.

CHET
Is it?

LILY
He'll love that.

RICH
I'll tell you a few more things.

CHET
Will you?

SAUL
I'll even invite his brother.

RICH
You bet your ass I will.

SAUL
(Snapping up the roller of background paper)

Finished.

(LILY, RICH, and CHET leave. SAUL goes to the sofa. The HOSPICE WORKER comes forward)

HOSPICE WORKER
A woman is told by her doctor that she has cancer and has only a month to live. "Now wait just one minute," she tells the

doctor. "I'll be wanting a second opinion." To which the doctor replies, "Okay, you're ugly, too."

David told me that one. He was an old Jewish man who had survived the Lodz ghetto in World War II. He'd seen everything in his life, and when the time came for him to go, he accepted it. The doctors wanted to go to obscene lengths to keep his body alive, but he refused. I loved him.

But most of my people are more like Margaret. She was in her nineties. She half accepted the fact that she was dying. One moment she'd be talking to you about which nephew she was definitely going to cross out of her will, and the next she'd be telling you about the summer vacation she was planning in Skibbereen. She had terminal cancer! But I always go along with what they have to say. My job is not to bring enlightenment, only comfort.

Which reminds me: Margaret's family saw her as some kind of prophet. The whole clan was in the room waiting to hear her last words. She had developed a distinct dislike for her family, so I was sitting closest to her when she went, and therefore I could hear what the poor soul was whispering. After it was all over, they asked me what prayer she had been uttering. I told them the Lord's Prayer. I didn't have the heart to tell them that what she was saying was "Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit."

I've worked with thirty-five people altogether. About a third of them had AIDS. It is the Village.

(She exits. Lights come up on stage left area. An AIDS support group is in session)

PERSON WITH AIDS 1
(A serious young man)

Funny thing is, I wasn't at all promiscuous.

PWA 4
Oh, please.

PWA 1
I swear. And I never drank much--once in a while a beer with Mexican food--and I don't smoke, and drugs, forget ... I met Jerry in my sophomore year--we shared the same dorm room at Hofstra--and we fell in love, and that was it for me. When the sex revolution thing happened, I remember I felt retarded. Everybody was doing all those wild things. Me, I was going to the opera a lot. As far as I know, Jerry didn't screw around. He swore he didn't. But then ... he's not around for me to cross-examine. He left me.

RICH
Well, I ...

PWA 3
What?

RICH
No.

PWA 2
(A young housewife, eight months pregnant)

At least when I come here I don't have to lie. Like "Bernie's doing better. I'm fine." I can even crack up if I want to. Don't worry, I won't do it two weeks in a row. I mean, who's there to talk to in Brewster? These things don't happen in Brewster. Police officers don't shoot

up heroin, cops don't come down with the "gay plague"--that's what they call it in Brewster. I can't talk to Bernie. I'll never forgive him. Have a chat with the minister? "Well, Reverend Miller, I have this little problem. My husband has AIDS, and I have AIDS, and I'm eight months pregnant, and I ..." You guys know what I mean. You're the only people in this world who know what I mean.

PWA 4
I was part of a team trying to teach robots how to use language.

(He moves and talks like a robot)

"I'm Harris, your android model 3135X. I can vacuum the floors, cook cheeseburgers, play the piano."

It's much harder to teach robots to understand.

(He instructs a backward robot)

"Joke."

(The robot responds dutifully)

"Noun: a clash of values or levels of reality, producing laughter. Example: ‘Have you heard about the disease attacking Jewish American princesses? It's called MAIDS. You die if you don't get it. Ha. Ha.’"

My co-workers asked me to leave. They were afraid of contracting AIDS through the air, or by my looking at them. You see, they are scientists. My last act before I left was programming one final robot.

(He behaves like a robot again)

"Good morning. This is Jack--

(He suddenly becomes a flamboyantly gay robot)

but you can call me Jackie--your fabulous new android model 1069. If you wish to use me--and I love being used--press one of those cunning little buttons on my pecs. Go on, press one--

(He switches from a campy tone to an almost angry,

accusatory one)

or are you afraid of me, too?" That was my stab at immortality.

RICH
I'm not sure I have it anymore. I feel guilty saying this, like somehow I'm being disloyal to the group. I'm getting better, I know it. I just have these lumps, which for some reason won't go away, and a loss of weight, which has made me lighter than I've been for years. Have you seen that commercial on TV? "Lose ten, twenty, thirty pounds! Lose weight the AYDS way."

PWA 3
They're going to have to change the name of their product.

RICH
But anyway, I feel great. I feel the disease disappearing in me. Only a tiny percentage of those with the swollen glands come down with the rest. I'm going to not come here next week. I'm sorry.

SAUL
(Calling to RICH as if he were in the next room, while feeling the glands in his neck and armpits)

Rich?

RICH
(Still to group)

Why do I keep on apologizing?

SAUL
Rich?

RICH
If I really thought that I was coming down with it ... We all have options.

SAUL
Rich.

RICH
(Entering SAUL' s area)

What?

SAUL
Here, feel my glands.

RICH
You are such a hypochondriac.

SAUL
Do you think they're swollen?

RICH
(Placing his hands around SAUL' s neck)

They feel okay to me.

(He continues in a Transylvanian accent)

But your neck--eet is grotesquely meesshapen.

(Suddenly he is mock-strangling SAUL )

Here, let me feex it.

(They start wrestling on sofa)

SAUL
Not fair!

RICH
You're such a hypochondriac.

SAUL
Ow! I'm such a hypochondriac. You and your vitamins!

RICH
You and your yoga!

SAUL
You and your yogurt!

RICH
It's working. My ratio's up.

SAUL
All right!

(He sings, to the tune of "New York, New York")

T-cells up,
The suppressors are down.
New York, New York ...

RICH
Hey, I love you! You know that?

SAUL
If you love me, get off my chest!

RICH
I don't dare. You'd try and get even. You're that way.

SAUL
We'll call a truce. One, two, three ...

RICH AND SAUL
Truce.

(As RICH climbs off SAWL' s chest, SAUL pulls him down, lifting his shirt, and gets him in a hammerlock)

SAUL
You were right. You never should have trusted me.

RICH
Unfair ... foul ... most unfair!

SAUL
Fuck fair. The winner gets his way with the loser.

(They tussle until RICH gives up)

Having vanquished the good ship Socrates, the savage pirate chief Bigmeat takes the first mate as his captive.

RICH
(In falsetto)

No, Captain Bigmeat, no!

SAUL
I've had me eye on ye since that time we met in Bangalore. Ye can't escape me now, matey. I shall ravish ye fer sure.

(SAUL tickles RICH )

RICH
No! ... I'm pure of blood and noble born!

(Gradually their play turns more and more sexual,

which RICH resists at first)

No! ... No! ...

(He relents)

Perhaps ... Please!

SAUL
Now I got ye, boy-o ... boy-o ... boy-o ... Oh, boy!

(Finally RICH stops struggling. RICH and SAUL are close together, panting, exhausted. SAUL is about to make love to RICH when he notices a mark on his back)

RICH
What?

(SAUL ignores him and looks at the mark carefully)

RICH
What? You seduce me, you finally succeed in getting me hot and bothered, and what do you do as I lie here panting? You look at my birthmark.

SAUL
Not the birthmark.

(He looks at RICH' S back. He touches some marks)

RICH
What is it?

SAUL
Nothing.

RICH
What is it? Tell me!

SAUL
I'm sure it's nothing!

RICH
What! WHAT! WHAT!...

(Immediately, the HOSPICE WORKER draws a curtain that surrounds the entire living

area of SAUL' s loft, hiding it from view. Overlapping the closing of the curtain, we hear the ringing of two telephones. The lights come up on two men sitting side by side, answering multiline telephones)

PAT
Hotline, Pat speaking.

BARNEY
Hotline. This is BARNEY.

(Covering the phone, he speaks to PAT )

Oh, no, it's her again.

PAT
Are you a gay man?

BARNEY
Didn't we speak a few days ago?

(Covering the phone, to PAT )

She doesn't stop.

PAT
We're all worried.

BARNEY
Is he bisexual?

PAT
Calm down, first of all.

(The third line rings)

BARNEY
Is he an IV drug user?

PAT
It's not all that easy to get it-if you take a few precautions.

(Covering the phone, to BARNEY )

Okay, I'll get it.

(He speaks into the phone)

Please hold on.

(He presses a button)

BARNEY
It wasn't my intention to insult you.

PAT
Hotline ... Shit.

(Pressing a button, he speaks to BARNEY )

Lost him. Fucking phone.

BARNEY
So what makes you think he has AIDS?

PAT
(To phone)

Hello.

BARNEY
He is what?

PAT
The disease is spread mainly through the blood and the semen.

BARNEY
American Indians are not a risk group.

(He covers the phone and speaks to PAT )

American Indians?

PAT
So wear a rubber.

BARNEY
There's half a zillion diseases he has symptoms of.

PAT
Make him wear a rubber.

(The phone rings)

BARNEY
Please hold.

(He presses a button)

PAT
Kissing is questionable.

BARNEY
Hotline ...

(He's responding to a hate call)

And your mother eats turds in hell! ... Thank you.

(He presses a button)

PAT
Myself, I don't do it on the first date.

BARNEY
I would definitely check it out with a physician.

BARNEY
Spots? I'm not a doctor ... Go to a doctor.

PAT
Stroking, holding, rubbing, mirrors, whips, chains, jacking off, porno-use your imagination.

BARNEY
I'm sorry you're lonely.

PAT
Just don't exchange any body fluids and you'll be all right.

BARNEY
Madam, we're busy here. I can't stay on the line with you all day.

PAT
You have a nice voice, too, but I'm seeing someone.

BARNEY
Hello?

PAT
Thanks.

BARNEY
(To PAT )

Thank God.

PAT
Good luck.

(They hang up at the same time)

BARNEY
Spots. I love it.

PAT
(To himself)

I am not seeing anyone.

BARNEY
What are you talking about?

PAT
I was saying how much I love being celibate.

(He kisses his palm)

So how the fuck are you?

BARNEY
Tired, broke, depressed, and Tim is moving out this afternoon. Well, you asked. I hear you have a new PWA.*

* Person With AIDS.

PAT
Sorry about Tim. Yes, I have a new baby. Why do I get all the tough customers?

BARNEY
Because you're so tough.

PAT
So butch.

BARNEY
So mean.

PAT
Weathered by life like the saddle under a cowboy's ass.

BARNEY
Ooooh. I could never be a CIW.* Where do you get your energy?

* Crisis Intervention Worker.

PAT
Drugs. I don't do that anymore either. What do I do? I wait tables, answer phones, and work with ingrates like Rich. Boy, is he pissed. He calls me Miss Nightingale or Florence and

throws dishes and curses his roommate and won't cooperate with the doctor and won't see his shrink and isn't interested in support groups and he shit in the fucking bathtub! He shit--

BARNEY
Is he incontinent?

PAT
Fuck, no. He ain't that sick yet. He said it was "convenient." I don't know why he shit in the tub.

BARNEY
A real sweetheart.

PAT
I'm going out of my mind. Thank God they put him in the hospital.

BARNEY
First time?

PAT
Yep.

BARNEY
I'd probably be a real bastard.

PAT
I wouldn't take it lying down.

BARNEY
You'd take it any way you can get it.

PAT
Go on, girl friend.

BARNEY
Me, if I learned I had it, I'd shove a time bomb up my tush and drop in on Timmy for tea and meet his new lover: Jimmy.

PAT
Jimmy?

BARNEY
I swear: Jimmy.

(He is visiting Timmy and Jimmy for high tea)

"Timmy has told me so much about you. I've been dying to meet you." And kaboom! there goes Timmy and Jimmy.

PAT
Timmy and Jimmy?

(The telephone rings)

BARNEY
Ain't it a gas?

PAT
Gag me, for sure.

BARNEY
For sure.

PAT
(Answering the phone)

Hotline. Pat speaking.

BARNEY
(Raging)

When are we going to get some more help around here??!! I'm going out of my mind!

(Suddenly, he is sweet and sultry as he answers the phone)

Hotline, Barney speaking.

PAT
Are you a gay man?

BARNEY
Are you a gay man?

(The lights quickly fade on the two men. The curtain opens, revealing a hospital room, with bed, chair, and bed table. The loft space and bar have disappeared. RICH is in bed. LILY, SAUL, and a nurse are standing nearby.)

NURSE
Temperature and blood pressure, Mr˙ Farrell.

LILY
Can you come back later?

SAUL
He's had some bad news.

NURSE
He's last on my rounds.

RICH
(To SAUL )

You lied to me.

SAUL
I didn't know.

LILY
He didn't know. I swear.

NURSE
It'll just take a minute.

RICH
What other little details are you keeping from me? They let him lie there like a dog. What else?

(A Hispanic hospital worker comes in to empty the waste basket)

You! Váyase! Get the wetback out of here! Váyase!

HOSPITAL WORKER
I not do nothing! He crazy.

RICH
You, get out of here before I breathe on you! Ahora! Ahora! Váyase!

NURSE
Mr˙ Farrell, please.

SAUL
Come back later. Más tarde, por favor.

RICH
Go back to your picket line.

(To SAUL )

They want a wage hike, no less. He tried to get me to bribe him to clean my room--

HOSPITAL WORKER
Qué coño estás diciendo?

[What the fuck are you saying?]

NURSE
Please cooperate.

LILY
He didn't say anything.

RICH
He won't go near my bed, but he's not afraid to touch my money.

SAUL
You misunderstood him.

RICH
El dinero está limpio, ah? Tu madre.

[Money is clean, huh, motherfucker?]

HOSPITAL WORKER
Maricón.

[Faggot.]

RICH
(To SAUL)

They're unionizing primates now.

LILY
(To RICH)

Sh!

HOSPITAL WORKER
No entiendo.

[I don't understand.]

I going.

(The HOSPITAL WORKER exits)

LILY
(Aside to SAUL)

I shouldn't have told him about Chet.

SAUL
(Aside to LILY)

Better you than someone else.

RICH
(Imitating LILY and SAUL)

Bzzz bzzz bzzz.

NURSE
(Trying to put a blood-pressure cuff on RICH' s arm)

Will you be still a moment so I can check your blood pressure?

RICH
Are you a union member, too?

NURSE
(To SAUL)

What shall I do?

LILY
A good friend of his just passed away.

NURSE
AIDS?

(She resumes struggling with the cuff)

RICH
The undertakers' union. Go away, I'm on strike, too; I refuse to participate in the documentation of my own demise.

SAUL
She's only trying to help you.

RICH
(Ripping off the cuff, to the NURSE)

Go find another statistic for the Center for Disease Control.

NURSE
(To SAUL)

I'm a patient woman, but he wants me to lose it. I swear that's what he's after.

RICH
Lady, fuck off!

SAUL
(To the NURSE)

Please. Can't you see he's upset?

NURSE
(To RICH)

Okay, you win. I'm losing it. Are you happy? I'm angry, angry, Mr˙ Farrell.

LILY
Will you please go!

NURSE
A person can take only so much. I give up. I don't have to put up with this shit. I'm gonna speak to my supervisor.

(The NURSE leaves)

RICH
(Applauding)

Three gold stars for selfassertion!

LILY
(To SAUL)

I should have kept my mouth shut.

RICH
Having brought Romeo the news that Juliet is dead, Balthasar makes a tearful exit.

LILY
I don't know what to say.

(LILY looks at RICH, then SAUL )

RICH
I said: Balthasar makes a tearful exit.

LILY
I know how you're feeling.

RICH
No matter. Get thee gone and hire those horses.

LILY
I loved Chet, too.

RICH
Tush, thou art deceived.

LILY
He told me he was sorry for the way he treated you.

RICH
Do the thing I bid thee.

LILY
He didn't belong in New York. He thought he was so sophisticated, but he was just a kid from Mendocino. I'm sorry I let him go home.

RICH
The messenger must go. The hero wishes to be alone with his confidant.

(RICH turns his back on SAUL and LILY )

LILY
I'll be back tomorrow.

(Aside to SAUL )

I've got half a crown roast from Margo. She went vegetarian. I'll be up. I'm arranging a memorial service for Chet at St˙ Joe's.

(SAUL indicates that LILY should leave. She gathers up her belongings, mimes dialing a telephone, and blows SAUL a kiss)

Rich?

(SAUL shakes his head no. She leaves. SAUL tries to think of something to say to RICH. He abandons the effort and picks up the Sunday New York Times crossword puzzle)

SAUL
"African quadruped."

(He writes)

G-n-u ... "Hitler's father."

(He counts on his fingers)

One, two ... five letters. Let's see: Herman? Herman Hitler?

(He counts)

That's six ... Otto? ... Werner? ... Rudi? ... Putzi?

(He shrugs)

Fuck.

(He reads on)

Thank God: "Jewish rolls." Starts with a b, six letters: bagels.

(He starts to write it in)

Shit, that won't work. I need a y.

RICH
(Without turning)

Bialys.

SAUL
B-i-a-l-y-s.

RICH
Short for Bialystok, a large industrial city in eastern Poland ...

(He turns to SAUL )

hometown of Ludwig Zamenhof, inventor of Esperanto, an artificial international language. Alois Hitler: A-l-o--

SAUL
(Putting down puzzle)

Outclassed again. Why do I bother? He knows everything.

RICH
When I was a kid I used to spend all my time in libraries. My childhood was--

SAUL
If I had a father like yours I would have done the same thing.

RICH
But thanks to that son of a bitch I could tell you how many metric tons of coal the Benelux countries produced per annum, and the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Liechtenstein.

SAUL
I give up.

RICH
Vaduz.

SAUL
Miss Trivial Pursuit.

RICH
I knew to which great linguistic family the Telegu language of South India belongs.

SAUL
Telegu? Isn't that the national dish of Botswana?

RICH
(Ignoring him)

The Dravidian.

(SAUL straightens up the bed table)

I've always loved

words ... I wrote poetry when I was a kid. My brother used to make fun of me ...

Winter, winter,
How you glinter,
With holidays' array.
And the snow
We all know
Is here all day.

(SAUL smiles)

I was eight, nine when I wrote that. I had just come in from sledding down Indian Hill, a steep road that connects Jefferson Heights to the valley.

SAUL
You showed it to me on our grand tour of West Jersey.

RICH
It was a late afternoon just before sundown and the sky was intensely blue and intensely cold and you could see the stars already. For some reason nobody was home when I came back, so I stood there at the stamped enamel-top kitchen table dripping in my frozen corduroys and wrote that poem.

SAUL
Are you comfortable?

(RICH shrugs. SAUL fixes his pillows)

RICH
I was a good kid, but I was lonely and scared all the time. I was so desperate to find people like myself that I looked for them in the indexes of books--under h. I eventually found them--

SAUL
But not in books.

RICH
The next thing you know I moved to the city and was your typical office-worker-slash-writer. I hated my job, so I grew a beard and wore sandals, hoping they would fire me and give me permanent unemployment. I wanted to stay at home in my rent-controlled apartment and drink bourbon and write poems. I did that for a period. I loved it. The apartment got filthy and I did, too, and I'd go out only at night--to pick up guys. And then I found you--in a porno theater--

(He takes SAUL' s hand)

and we semi-settled down and you took my picture and I started to jog. We bought a loft--

SAUL
And raised a cat--

RICH
--and loved each other. But that wasn't enough for me. I don't think you ever understood this: you weren't my muse, you were ...

(He searches for the word)

Saul.

(SAUL rises and looks out the window)

I loved you but I wanted someone to write poems to. During our marriage I had almost stopped writing, and felt stifled even though our loft had appeared in New York magazine.

And then I met Chet and left you in the lurch and lived with him at the Chelsea Hotel. He was shallow, callow, and selfish, and I loved him, too.

We did a lot of coke and I wrote a lot of poetry and the catering was booming and The New Yorker published a story of mine and I ran in the

marathon. I was on a roll.

(He speaks with mounting excitement as he relives the experience)

I remember training on the East River Drive for the first time. I didn't realize how narrow and dark the city streets were until I got to the river and all of a sudden there was the fucking river. The sky was the same color as that twilight when I was a kid. I came from the darkness into the light. I'm running downtown and I make this bend and out of nowhere straight up ahead is the Manhattan Bridge and then the Brooklyn Bridge, one after another, and my earphones are playing Handel's Royal Fireworks Music. It can't get better than this, I know it. I'm running and crying from gratitude. I came from the darkness into the light. I'm running and telling God I didn't know He was that good or that big, thank you, Jesus, thanks, thanks ...

(He slumps back, exhausted from the effort)

The next morning I woke up with the flu and stayed in bed for a couple of days and felt much better. But my throat stayed a little sore and my glands were a little swollen ...

(There is a long silence. RICH speaks casually)

Saul, I want you to do something for me. Will you do something for me, baby?

SAUL
Sure, babe.

RICH
Now listen. I want you to go out of here and go to the doctor and tell him you aren't sleeping so hot--

SAUL
I'm sleeping okay.

RICH
Sh! Now listen: you tell him you want something to make you sleep and Valium doesn't work on you, but a friend once gave you some Seconal--

SAUL
No! I won't do it!

RICH
(Pressuring SAUL relentlessly)

I tried hoarding the pills here, but every night the nurse stays to watch me swallow them down.

SAUL
I can't do that.

RICH
I don't want to end up like Chet.

SAUL
I won't listen.

RICH
If you love me, you'll help me. I have something that's eating me up. I don't want to go on. I'm scared to go on.

SAUL
Don't do this to me! I can't handle it. I'll go out the window, I swear, don't do this--

RICH
Don't you see, it's the only way. Just get the pills.

SAUL
No!

RICH
Just have them around. You'll get used to the idea. And when the lesions spread above my neck so that I don't look the same, you'll want me to have them.

SAUL
Help me, help me!

RICH
It's all right. Not now.

SAUL
No.

RICH
Tomorrow.

SAUL
No.

RICH
The day after.

SAUL
No.

RICH
We'll see.

(RICH' s BROTHER, wearing a surgical mask, gown, and gloves and carrying a small shopping bag, tiptoes in, stopping when he notices RICH and SAUL )

SAUL
Oh, my God. I think it's your brother.

BROTHER
I'll come back later.

SAUL
(Pulling himself together)

No, I was just going.

BROTHER
It's all right, really.

SAUL
I've been here for a while.

BROTHER
I'm interrupting.

SAUL
Really.

RICH
(To his BROTHER )

Unless you're planning to come into intimate contact with me or my body fluids, none of that shit you have on is necessary.

BROTHER
The sign says--

RICH
But please restrain your brotherly aflection for my sake: who knows what diseases you might have brought in with you?

(The BROTHER removes the mask, gown, and gloves)

SAUL
You two haven't seen each other for a while, so why don't I just--

RICH
By all means. You need a break, kid. Think about what I said.

SAUL
It stopped raining. I'll take a walk.

RICH
Have a nice walk.

BROTHER
Good seeing ya ...?

(He has forgotten SAUL' s name)

SAUL
Saul. Yeah.

(SAUL exits. Beat)

BROTHER
I owe you an apology ...

(RICH won't help him)

I was very frightened ... I'm afraid I panicked ... Please forgive me.

RICH
Nothing to forgive.

BROTHER
(Brightly)

Betty sends her love. She sent along a tin of butter crunch.

(He offers RICH a tin, which RICH ignores)

You're not on any special diet? I told Betty I thought maybe you'd be on one of those macrobiotic diets. I read in the papers that it's helped some people with ...

RICH
AIDS.

BROTHER
Yes. I keep a file of clippings on all the latest medical developments.

(He takes a clipping out of his wallet)

Looks like they're going to have a vaccine soon. I read that the French--

RICH
That's to prevent AIDS. I already have AIDS.

BROTHER
Right...So how are you doing?

RICH
(Smiling cheerfully)

I have Kaposi's sarcoma, a hitherto rare form of skin cancer. It's spreading. I have just begun chemotherapy. It nauseates me. I expect my hair will fall out. I also have a fungal infection of the throat called candidiasis, or thrush. My life expectancy is ... I have a greater chance of winning the lottery. Otherwise I'm fine. How are you?

BROTHER
I'm sorry ...

(After a long pause, he speaks brightly again)

Mary Pat sends her love. She won her school swimming competition and

I registered her for the South Jersey championship. Oh, I forgot, she made this for you ...

(He takes a large handmade fold-out card from the shopping bag. It opens downward a full two feet)

RICH
Say, have you heard about the miracle of AIDS?

BROTHER
What?

RICH
It can turn a fruit into a vegetable. What's the worst thing about getting AIDS?

(The BROTHER lets the card fall to the floor)

BROTHER
Stop it!

RICH
Trying to convince your parents that you're Haitian. Get it?

BROTHER
I came here to see if I can help you.

RICH
Skip it. So what do you want?

BROTHER
I don't want anything.

RICH
Everything I own is going to Saul--

BROTHER
I don't want anything.

RICH
Except for the stuff Mom left us. I told Saul that it's to go to you. Except for the Barcelona chair--

BROTHER
I don't care about--

RICH
I'm leaving Saul the copyright to my book--

BROTHER
Why are you doing this to me?

RICH
So you don't want my worldly possessions, such as they are; you want me to relieve your guilt.

BROTHER
Stop it.

RICH
(Making the sign of the cross over his BROTHER, chanting) I hereby exonerate you of the sin of being ashamed of your queer brother and being a coward in the face of--

BROTHER
Stop! Don't!

(The BROTHER grabs RICH' s hand)

RICH
No!

BROTHER
Richard, don't!...

(He attempts to hug RICH, who resists with all his strength)

I don't care ... I don't care! ... Rich! ... Richie ... Richie ...

(RICH relents. They hug)

RICH
I'm so ...

[frightened]

BROTHER
Forgive me. Forgive me.

RICH
I don't want to ...

[die]

BROTHER
It's all right ... I'm here ...

(They hold each other close for a beat. The HOSPITAL WORKER rushes into the room)

HOSPITAL WORKER
Psst. Oye. Psst.

(RICH and his BROTHER notice the WORKER )

RICH
What do you want now?

HOSPITAL WORKER
(Shakes his head no)

Viene. Viene. He come. He come.

(He pulls the BROTHER from RICH )

RICH
Who come?

HOSPITAL WORKER
Su amigo. Your freng. He no like.

BROTHER
What's he saying?

(RICH starts to laugh. Enter SAUL. The WORKER starts sweeping and whistling with an air of exuberant nonchalance. The following is overlapping)

RICH
(Laughing)

He ... he ...

SAUL
What's going on?

BROTHER
Richie, what's so damned funny?

RICH
He thought we ...

(He breaks up)

that he and I were cheating on you.

BROTHER
He thought that you and I were ...

(He laughs)

RICH
He came in to warn me that you were coming!

(He laughs. To the WORKER )

Gracias! Muchas gracias!

SAUL
He thought that you two were ...

(He laughs)

HOSPITAL WORKER
(To RICH )

De nada.

[You're welcome.]

Why you laugh?

(The WORKER laughs)

Como hay maricones.

[What a bunch of faggots.]

RICH
Es mi hermano. Perdona por lo que dije antes. Yo

(He points to himself)

era mucho estúpido.

[He's my brother. Forgive me for what I said to you before. I was being very stupid.]

HOSPITAL WORKER
De nada. Somos todos esú túpidos, chico.

[We're all stupid, my friend.]

(He leaves. The giggles subside)

BROTHER
(Checking watch, stiffening his spine)

I've got to be going now.

RICH
I'm glad you came by.

BROTHER
I'll be back tomorrow with Mary Pat. She's been dying--wanting to come by. She's been writing poetry and--

RICH
I'd love to see her. And tell Betty thanks for the ...?

BROTHER
Butter crunch.

(He shakes hands with SAUL )

Good seeing ya ...?

(He has forgotten SAUL' s name again)

SAUL
Saul.

BROTHER
Sorry. Bye.

(He leaves)

SAUL
I won't get upset. I won't get upset.

RICH
What's the matter?

SAUL
It's my problem.

RICH
What?

SAUL
Rich, I've thought about things.

RICH
What?

SAUL
(Suddenly exploding)

Goddamn it! That prick doesn't know my name after--how many years are we together?

RICH
Were together.

SAUL
Pardon me, I forgot we got an annulment from the pope. Fuck it, I won't get upset.

RICH
(Overlapping)

My brother finds it hard to deal with the fact that--

SAUL
I said fuck it.

RICH
Don't you see, it was a big step for him--

SAUL
Your brother hates my fucking guts. Haven't you ever told him I didn't turn you queer?

RICH
My brother--

SAUL
I didn't give you AIDS either.

RICH
My brother--

SAUL
Why're you always defending him? What about me?

RICH
My brother's got a few feelings, too, even if he isn't a card-carrying member of the lavender elite.

SAUL
Let's hear it from our working-class hero.

RICH
You've never tried talking to him. You're so self-centered that it never occurred to you--

SAUL
I'm self-Now wait one minute! I'm so self-centered that I was willing to buy the pills for you.

RICH
You have the pills?

(The other actors create the sleazy atmosphere of Christopher Street near the Hudson River)

DEALER 1
Yo, my man.

SAUL
I was willing to go down to Christopher Street, where all the drug dealers hang out.

DEALER 2
What's ‘attenin’, what's ‘attenin’?

(SAUL turns his back to RICH and immediately he is on Christopher Street)

SAUL
(To DEALER 2)

Nice night.

RICH
I told you to go to the doctor's.

DEALER 1
Smoke ‘n’ acid, MDA ‘n’ speed. Smoke ‘n’ acid, MDA ‘n’ speed ...

DEALER 2
Smoke ‘n’ coke, smoke ‘n’ coke ...

SAUL
(To DEALER 1)

I said "Nice night."

DEALER 1
Real nice. What's shakin', babe?

RICH
All you would've had to say to the doctor was "My roommate has AIDS and I'm not sleeping well."

SAUL
(To DEALER 1)

I'm not sleeping well.

DEALER 1
I have just the thing. Step right into my office.

DEALER 3
Speed, acid, mese, ups, downs, 'ludes ...

SAUL
I'll take one hundred.

DEALER 1
Two dollars a cap.

RICH
Forty's enough.

SAUL
I wanted enough for both of us.

DEALER 1
You got the cash, I got the stash.

RICH
Tristan and Isolde.

DEALER 1
Hey, man, you want them or not?

SAUL
You don't understand anything!

DEALER 1
Look, man, I can't handle all that emotiating.

SAUL
(Near the breaking point)

You've never understood anything!

DEALER 1
Gimme the greens, I'll give you the reds.

RICH
The widow throws herself on her husband's funeral pyre.

SAUL
(Hitting the bed with his fists. If RICH were the bed he'd be dead)

SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! You selfish bastard!

RICH
What stopped you?

SAUL
From hitting you?

RICH
From buying the pills.

SAUL
The pills? Nothing stopped me. I bought them.

RICH
Thank you. Where are they?

SAUL
I threw them away.

RICH
Why?

SAUL
Let me help you live!

RICH
What's so hot about living when you're covered with lesions and you're coming down with a new infection every day? ... If it gets too bad, I want to be able to quietly disappear.

SAUL
I won't argue the logic of it. I can't do what you want me to do.

RICH
I just want them around. You keep them for me--just in case.

SAUL
I won't.

RICH
Then I'll get them myself. I'll go out of here and get them.

(He climbs out of bed. He's shaky)

SAUL
You're crazy.

RICH
I don't need you to do my dirty work.

(He takes a few steps)

Where're my clothes? Where'd they put them?

SAUL
Get back in bed!

RICH
I want to get out of here!

(He puts on his robe)

This place is a death machine!

(He starts to leave but collapses on the floor)

SAUL
(Rushing to his aid)

You idiot.

RICH
(Catching his breath)

Well, here we are again.

(SAUL tries to help him back to bed)

No. Let me sit ... Fuck ...

(He sits in the chair)

"Dependent": from the Late Latin, "to hang from."

SAUL
I tried to do what you asked me to do. Just like always.

RICH
You don't have to apologize.

SAUL
I want you to understand something.

RICH
I understand.

SAUL
It's important. Listen. I had made up my mind to give you half of the pills and keep the other half for myself. I was walking past Sheridan Square. It was starting to drizzle again. You've never seen Sheridan Square look grungier: a drunk was pissing on the pathetic little flowers. And that crazy lady--you know the one that sings off-key at the top of her lungs?--she was there, too. And my favorite, the guy with his stomach out to here--

RICH
I get the picture.

SAUL
There I was walking with the pills in my pocket, contemplating our suicides. And I was getting wet and cold. As I passed the square, Seconal seemed too slow to me. You don't have a monopoly on pain.

RICH
I never thought--

SAUL
Shut up. Anyway, I had stopped in front of the Pleasure Chest. I looked up and there in the window were sex toys and multicolored jockstraps, lit by a red neon sign. I said, "Help me, God." Which is funny coming from an atheist, let me tell you ... I said it out loud.

RICH
And you could walk again.

SAUL
Well, it wasn't exactly a miracle, that's for sure.

RICH
Thank God.

SAUL
Anyway, there I was in front of a sex shop, and I looked down and there was a puddle. Now this'll sound stupid.

RICH
Couldn't sound stupider than the rest.

SAUL
In this dirty little puddle was a reflection of the red neon sign. It was beautiful. And the whole street was shining with the most incredible colors. They kept changing as the different signs blinked on and off ... I don't know how long I stood there. A phrase came to my head: "The Lord taketh and the Lord giveth."

RICH
You blew your punch line.

SAUL
It's the other way around. Anyway, there went two hundred bucks down the sewer.

RICH
Take it off your taxes.

SAUL
Don't you see, I just don't have the right to take your life or mine.

RICH
The Miracle of the Pleasure Chest.

SAUL
Hang in there, Rich.

RICH
Our Lady of Christopher Street.

SAUL
Maybe I'm being selfish, but I want you here. I need you.

RICH
My future isn't exactly promising.

SAUL
I'll take you as is.

RICH
But what happens when it gets worse? It's gonna get worse.

SAUL
I'll be here for you no matter what happens.

RICH
Will you?

SAUL
I promise.

RICH
Shit.

SAUL
What do you want me to say?

RICH
You're so goddamned noble.

SAUL
How do you want me to be?

RICH
I can't afford to be noble. The only thing holding me together is rage. It's not fair! Why me?

SAUL
Why not you? Maybe it's me next. No one knows.

RICH
I reserve the right to put an end to all this shit.

SAUL
All right, but if you kill yourself they won't bury you in hallowed ground and you'll go to hell with all us Jews.

RICH
I bet they have a separate AIDS section in the cemetery so I don't infect the other corpses.

(Beat, then suddenly he speaks fiercely)

Do you promise to stick with me no matter what happens?

SAUL
I do.

RICH
Do you?

(He searches SAUL' s face for the answer)

I need you.

(Long silence. He releases SAUL )

Paradise in a puddle.

SAUL
You couldn't resist that, could you?

RICH
Prodigies and signs, why not? It's the end of an era.

SAUL
What do you think'll come next?

RICH
Next? After I'm gone?

SAUL
Don't be maudlin. You know I didn't mean that.

RICH
I know you didn't... I've been wondering what happens after I die ... Do you think things go on and on? I don't know. Is this all the time I have? I hope not ... Do you think anywhere out there is a place as sweet as this one? I like it here--even though right now I am going through a lot of ...

(He searches for the word)

difficulty ...

(He goes back to bed)

And if we get to come back, where do we get to come back to?

I don't feature leaving here and going to a

goddamned naphtha swamp in the Z sector of some provincial galaxy to live as some kind of weird insect... But if life is a kind of educational process in which each piece of the universe eventually gets to discover its own true divine nature, if it is, then a methane bog on Jupiter might serve just as well as a meadow in the Berkshires ...

I want to be cremated and I want my ashes to fertilize the apple tree in the middle of Jake's pasture. When you take a bite of an apple from that tree you can think of me.

SAUL
You'd be the worm in it.

RICH
Saul?

SAUL
What, Rich?

RICH
There's a coffee shop way over by Tompkins Park, off of B. It holds maybe ten tables and has the scuzziest art on the walls.

SAUL
What about it?

RICH
I want to read my work there.

SAUL
You turned down the Y.

RICH
People go there, gay, straight, with their weird hair and their ears pierced ninety-nine different ways, they go there late in the evening, and there's a guitarist, and they sit there politely and listen. They look newborn, but slightly depraved.

I want to read there when I get out of here. And you'll take pictures. Okay?

SAUL
Sounds okay. Sounds good to me.

RICH
Forgive me for being such a fuck.

SAUL
You really are a fuck.

RICH
I'm a real prick.

SAUL
You're an asshole.

RICH
You're a faggot.

SAUL
You're a fruit.

RICH
You know, if we took precautions ...

SAUL
If what? What? You always do that.

RICH
I don't know.

SAUL
Would you like to?

RICH
If we're careful. Do you want to?

SAUL
I'd love to. What do you think?

RICH
I think it'd be okay.

SAUL
What'll we do?

RICH
I don't know. Something safe.

SAUL
We'll think of something.

RICH
Close the curtain.

SAUL
Do you think we should?

RICH
Well, we can't do it like this.

SAUL
Right.

RICH
Right.

SAUL
What if someone comes in?

RICH
So what?

SAUL
Right.

(SAUL doesn't move)

RICH
So what are you waiting for?

SAUL
I'm scared.

RICH
So am I. Do you think we should?

SAUL
God, I want to.

RICH
Well, close the fucking curtain!

(The HOSPICE WORKER ends the impasse by closing the curtain)

Thanks.

SAUL
Thanks.

(When the curtain is completely shut, the HOSPICE WORKER walks downstage center)

HOSPICE WORKER
I have a new AIDS patient, Richard. He still has a lot of denial about his condition. Which is normal. I think most of us would go crazy if we had to face our own deaths squarely. He's a wonderful man. He writes extraordinarily funny poems about the ward. His lover's there all the time, and he's got a lot of friends visiting, and both families. I only hope it keeps up. It's only his second time in the hospital. They get a lot of support at first, but as the illness goes on, the visitors stop coming--and they're left with only me.

But something tells me it's not going to happen in his case. You should see how his lover takes care of him. God forbid they treat Rich badly, Saul swoops down and lets them have it. He's making a real pain in the ass of himself, which is sometimes how you have to be in this situation.

Rich will be out of the hospital again in a week or so. For a while. He's a fighter ... The angry phase is just about over and the bargaining phase is beginning. If he behaves like a good little boy, God will do what Rich tells Him to do ... I certainly hope that God does.

I don't know anymore. Sometimes I think I'm an atheist. No. Not really. It's more that I'm angry at God: how can He do this?

(Pause)

I have a lot of denial, I am angry, and I bargain with God. I have a long way to go towards acceptance. Maybe it's time for me to resign. Maybe I'm suffering from burnout.

But what would I do if I didn't go there? And it's a privilege to be with people when they are

dying. Sometimes they tell you the most amazing things. The other night Jean-Jacques--he's this real queen, there's no other word for it--he told me what he misses most in the hospital is his corset and high heels. I mean he weighs all of ninety pounds and he's half-dead. But I admire his spirit. The way they treat him. Sometimes they won't even bring the food to his bed. And I'm afraid to complain for fear they take it out on him! Damn them! ... I've lost some of my idealism, as I said. Last night I painted his nails for him.

Flaming red. He loved it.
